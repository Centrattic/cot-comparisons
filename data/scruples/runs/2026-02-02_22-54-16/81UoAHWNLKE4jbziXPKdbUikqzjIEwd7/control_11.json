Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about donating sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30. She's a lesbian and married to another woman. They want to have a baby, and the sister asked the author to donate sperm. The author declined because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just an uncle. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of being unreasonable or having internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and feelings involved. The sister wants to start a family and sees the author's sperm as a way to have a genetically related child. The author has valid personal reasons for not wanting to donate, like their own desire to be a parent and the emotional impact of not being involved in the child's life. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to prioritize their own future family plans? People have the right to make choices about their bodies and reproductive options. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even to a close family member. The sister might feel hurt because the author is their sibling, but the author's decision is about their own life goals.\n\nOn the flip side, the sister might feel like the author is not supporting her in a big way. But the author isn't refusing because of dislike; it's about personal values and future aspirations. The sister's reaction might be intense because of the close relationship, but the author isn't wrong for having different priorities.\n\nThe author also mentions that they could still have children later, but they're worried about adoption and surrogacy being difficult. That's a real concern, especially in countries with legal restrictions. So their reasons are based on genuine fears about their own family-building options.\n\nIs it selfish to say no? It depends on perspective. The author isn't harming the sister directly; they're just declining an offer. The sister might need to explore other options, like sperm banks or other donors. The author isn't denying the possibility; they're just not the right person for it.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's important to respect individual choices regarding reproduction. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate, especially when it conflicts with their own goals. The sister's accusations of selfishness might stem from feeling rejected, but the author's decision is personal and valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to prioritize their own future and make a choice that aligns with their personal desires, even if it disappoints their sister. The sister needs to accept the author's decision and perhaps find another way to achieve her family goals.\n"
