Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is close to their sister and has a good relationship. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would mean the author is the genetic father but not the legal or custodial parent. The author is gay and wants to have children themselves in the future, possibly through adoption or other means. They feel that donating sperm would prevent them from being a full father, which is their dream. \n\nThe sister feels rejected and accuses the author of being selfish. The author is struggling with their decision because they know it might hurt their sister, but they also have valid personal reasons. \n\nLegally, sperm donation can be anonymous, but in this case, it's within the family, which complicates things emotionally. The author isn't being asked to be a parent, just a genetic donor. However, they want to be an active father, which is a valid aspiration. \n\nThe sister's right to have a family should be considered, but so should the author's personal goals. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially since it's not a medical necessity but a personal choice for the sister. The emotional impact on both sides is significant, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own dreams.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being wrong: They could be seen as selfish for not helping their sister, especially after all the support. However, wanting to be a father is a personal choice. \n\nArguments against: The author is not required to donate, and their feelings about fatherhood are legitimate. The sister's options for building a family are important, but they have other avenues (IVF, adoption, surrogacy) even if surrogacy isn't legal. The author's refusal doesn't prevent the sister from seeking other donors or methods, though it might be harder. \n\nIn the end, it's a personal decision. The author isn't in the wrong for declining, especially since it's a significant life choice that affects them directly. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author has the right to their own future plans.\n"
