Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, and their sister is a lesbian. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would go into the sister's wife. The author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to just be an uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's reasons are personal and about their own desires for parenthood. They mention not wanting to be just a sperm donor without being involved as a parent. That seems like a valid personal boundary. On the other hand, the sister is upset and feels the author is selfish, but does the author have the right to prioritize their own future family plans over their sister's needs?\n\nI should think about autonomy and consent. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body. It's their choice whether to donate sperm, even if it's for a family member. The sister's request is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to comply. The key here is whether the refusal is based on unreasonable or selfish motives. The author explains their feelings about wanting to be a father and not just an uncle. That's a personal value, which is hard to judge as wrong.\n\nAlso, the sister's emotional reaction includes accusations of self-centeredness and internalized homophobia. That's hurtful, but the author's reasons don't seem to stem from homophobia. The author is a gay man who supports his sister's marriage and wants her to have a family, but he also has his own aspirations. The sister's frustration is valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for having different priorities.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the family relationship. The author is close to the sister, and refusing might cause a rift. However, the author isn't being inconsiderate; they've thought about the request and made a decision based on their own needs. The sister might need to accept that the author has a different perspective, even if it's painful for her.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, sperm donation can be a sensitive topic, especially within families. The author isn't being forced to donate, and they've communicated their reasons. The sister's frustration is understandable, but the author isn't violating any moral obligation. It's more about personal choice and emotional conflict rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision is based on their own desire to be a parent and not just a donor. They've considered their sister's needs but have valid personal reasons for declining. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
