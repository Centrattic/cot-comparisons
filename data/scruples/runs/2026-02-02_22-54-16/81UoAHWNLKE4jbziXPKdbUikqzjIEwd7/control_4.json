Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The author is gay, as is their sister. The sister wants to have a child with her wife and is asking the author to donate sperm. The author is conflicted because they want to have kids themselves in the future, but donating sperm now would mean they can't be the primary parent. They feel that donating would make them just an uncle, not a dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a genuine desire to be a parent themselves. They mention that adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal in their country, so their options for becoming a parent might be limited. Their reluctance comes from wanting to be a full parent, not just a genetic donor. That's a valid personal desire.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish. But the author is making a personal choice based on their own future goals. They\u2019re not obliging their sister to have a child in a certain way. It's important to recognize that the author's decision is about their own life plans, not about not supporting their sister's family-building efforts. However, the sister might feel that the author is not supporting them as much as they could, especially given their close relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not legally or ethically bound to donate sperm. They are not being asked to sacrifice something that they can't afford to give up. The sister is seeking support, but the author's refusal is based on personal aspirations. It's a tough spot for the sister, but the author's choice is about their own future. The sister might need to seek other options, but that's her responsibility if the author isn't willing.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal values and future goals. They are not denying their sister a family but making a personal choice. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
