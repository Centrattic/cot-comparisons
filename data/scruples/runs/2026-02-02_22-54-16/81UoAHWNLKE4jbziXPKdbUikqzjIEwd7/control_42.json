Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and their sister are close, and the sister is making a significant request. The author's reasons are about their own desire to be a parent, which is valid. They feel that donating sperm would mean the child is raised by someone else, and they want full involvement if they ever have kids. \n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish. But personal autonomy is important. The author isn't obligated to donate their genetic material. They have their own future plans and feelings. It's their body and their decision. Even though the sister is in a position where she needs this for her family, the author's right to make choices about their own fertility should be respected.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional impact. The author is worried about being a dad, which is a personal goal. The sister's request conflicts with that. The author isn't being inconsiderate by not wanting to give up their chance. It's not about jealousy or homophobia as the sister suggests, but about personal desires and future possibilities.\n\nThe sister's frustration is understandable, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own wishes. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their body and future family plans. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
