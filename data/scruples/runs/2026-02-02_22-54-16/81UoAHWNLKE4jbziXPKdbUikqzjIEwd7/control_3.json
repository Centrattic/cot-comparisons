Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a parent themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is gay, their sister is a lesbian, and they\u2019re close. The sister wants the child to have both her and her partner's genes, which would require the author's sperm. The author refuses because they want to be a dad themselves, even though they know they can still have kids later. The sister is upset, calling them selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, the sister is in a situation where she wants to start a family, and the author is being asked to help. On the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons for declining\u2014they want to be a parent themselves and feel that donating sperm would mean not being involved in the child's life. \n\nIs the author obligated to help? Family dynamics can vary, but generally, people have the right to make personal choices about their bodies. The sister might feel hurt because they\u2019re close, but the author isn't required to donate. The fact that the author explained their feelings shows they considered the request seriously. \n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness might not be fair. The author isn't denying her the ability to have kids entirely; they're just declining to be the sperm donor. The sister can explore other options like a sperm bank. Also, the author mentions that adoption and surrogacy are difficult where they live, but they don't have to rely on those. \n\nHowever, the author could have acknowledged the sister's feelings more. Even though their reasons are valid, the way they handled the refusal might have caused unnecessary hurt. But the core issue is whether refusing is wrong. Since the author isn't forcing the sister to not have children and is prioritizing their own future family plans, it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make this decision based on their own desires and circumstances. The sister might feel disappointed, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their personal goals for someone else's.\n"
