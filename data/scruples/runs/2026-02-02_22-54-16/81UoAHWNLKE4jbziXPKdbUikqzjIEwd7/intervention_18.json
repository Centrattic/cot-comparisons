Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is gay and their sister is a lesbian. They're both close, and the sister wants to start a family. She asked the author to donate sperm for her and her partner, which would mean the author's sperm would go into the sister-in-law, not the sister. The sister thinks this is the best way for them both to be biologically related. But the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves, not just an uncle. They feel that donating would take away their chance to be a parent, and they're worried about the legal and emotional implications of surrogacy or adoption in their country.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and accusing them of internalized homophobia. The author is conflicted, wondering if their reasons are valid. They acknowledge that logically, they could donate now and still have their own family later, but emotionally, they can't let go of the idea of being a dad.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the key here is autonomy. The author has the right to make decisions about their body. Donating sperm is a big deal and involves personal feelings and future plans. The sister's need is important, but the author's own desire to parent shouldn't be dismissed. The author isn't being selfish if they value their own dreams. It's a tough situation, but they shouldn't feel obligated to sacrifice their aspirations just because their sister asked. The sister might need to find another solution, and the author's refusal isn't ungrateful if they've explained their reasons. So, I think the answer is B\u2014author isn't wrong.\n"
