Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister wants to have children and approached her brother, who is gay, to donate sperm. She wants to be biologically related to the child, using her partner as the gestational parent. The brother is close to his sister but feels conflicted because he wants to be a father himself. He's worried about not being able to experience fatherhood and the emotional impact of donating sperm without being involved in the child's life.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, personal desires, and family dynamics. The brother is making a personal choice about his reproductive rights. He's not forcing anyone; he's declining a request. His reasons are about his own future and emotional well-being. The sister is upset, feeling rejected, and accuses him of selfishness, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. \n\nAlso, the brother explains that he's not opposed to their having kids but can't sacrifice his own dreams of parenthood. The sister's hurt feelings are valid, but the brother's decision isn't inherently selfish. It's a matter of personal values and priorities. The situation highlights a conflict between two valid desires: the sister's wish to have a genetically related child and the brother's desire to be a parent. \n\nLegally and ethically, donating sperm is a personal choice. There's no obligation here. The sister might feel let down, but the brother isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own future. The answer should consider that both parties have valid perspectives without judgment.\n"
