Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her partner. The author is 25, his sister is a lesbian who wants to have a child. He's also gay. The sister wants him to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. He refuses because he wants to be a father himself someday, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He feels it's important to be fully involved in a child's life as a parent, not just a donor. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The sister's desire to have a child is valid, and she's seeking a way to have a biological connection. The author's refusal is based on his personal desire to be a parent. Both are valid personal choices. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is not being forced; it's a voluntary decision. The sister is upset because she expected support from her sibling, especially given their close relationship. However, the author has his own dreams and fears about not having children. Is it selfish to prioritize his own desires when the sister is in a position where she might not be able to become a parent otherwise? \n\nBut let's think about the context. The sister is using IVF, which is legal in their country, but adoption and surrogacy aren't options for her. She's trying to maximize the chances of having a child by including her partner's genes. The author has a supply of sperm but is choosing not to donate now. The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing his future over her immediate need. However, the author's reasoning is about wanting to experience full parenthood, which is a significant life goal. \n\nIs the refusal selfish? It's possible to see it both ways. On one hand, the author is not a parent yet, and his decision is about his own future. On the other hand, the sister's need to have a child is urgent and might not be fulfilled if he says no. However, the author isn't obligated to donate sperm. The sister's frustration might stem from unmet expectations of support from a close family member. \n\nAlso, the accusation of internalized homophobia is worth considering. The author is gay, and his desire to be a parent might be separate from his sexuality. It's possible he's been through his own journey of accepting his sexuality, but that doesn't necessarily make his current feelings invalid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he is not legally or morally bound to donate, then saying no is his right. However, the emotional impact on his sister is significant. But does that make him wrong? Maybe not. People have different priorities, and his decision is based on his own aspirations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's feelings are hurt, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his own life goals. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
