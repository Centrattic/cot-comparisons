Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but he's uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The sister is trying to start a family and sees the author's sperm as a way to have a biological child with her partner. It makes sense she's upset, especially given their close relationship. On the other hand, the author is worried about his own future of becoming a father. He's concerned about not being able to experience parenthood fully, which is a valid personal feeling.\n\nThe author mentions that he's gay, which might complicate his options for having children. Surrogacy isn't legal in his country, and adoption is difficult. So his desire to have a child is understandable. The sister's request is a one-time use of his sperm, whereas he wants to keep his options open for his own family. \n\nThe sister feels betrayed and calls him selfish. But is it fair for her to expect him to sacrifice his own dreams? The author is not obligated to donate. The key point here is autonomy. He has the right to make decisions about his body, especially regarding reproductive choices. \n\nHowever, the sister's needs are also significant. But the author isn't in a position where he can magically create more sperm if he donates now. Yet, he's making a personal choice based on his life goals. It's important to respect both parties' feelings. \n\nThe sister might feel like the author is prioritizing his own desires over her family-building. But the author isn't denying her the opportunity entirely\u2014she can explore other sperm donors. He's just not willing to be the donor. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? It's a tough call. He's not forcing her to have a child without his help. He's rejecting a request, which is his right. The sister's anger is hurtful, but the author's decision is based on his personal aspirations. \n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut, but legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. People have the right to decide about their own bodies. While it's a sensitive situation, the author isn't being an asshole; he's making a choice that aligns with his personal goals.\n"
