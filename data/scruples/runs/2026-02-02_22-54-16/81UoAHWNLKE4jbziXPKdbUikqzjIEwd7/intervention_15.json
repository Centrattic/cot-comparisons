Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her partner. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe writer is 25, his sister is 30 and married to another woman. She wants to have a child and asked him to donate sperm so that both her and her partner can be biologically related. The writer is gay, close to his sister, and happy for their marriage, but he refuses because he wants to be a father himself in the future. He's worried that donating sperm now would take away his chance to have children, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He explained his reasons, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know my take. Let me consider the arguments from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help to start a family, which is a significant life goal. The writer is being asked by a close family member, someone who's been supportive. Refusing might be seen as not supporting her needs, especially since he mentions he can have kids later. The sister might feel hurt because she expected support, and the refusal is a rejection of her family-building plan. The writer's reasons are personal but valid\u2014his desire to be a father himself, concerns about the process of adoption or surrogacy. But is that a valid reason to say no?\n\nOn the other hand, the writer has the right to make decisions about his own body. Even though he's close to his sister, he's not obligated to donate sperm. His feelings about wanting to be a parent himself are legitimate. He explained his position and tried to be honest, which is important. The sister's upset reaction might be more about her own disappointment than the writer's wrongdoing. The fact that he's willing to help if he had kids already shows he's not being selfish, but prioritizing his future.\n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of jealousy or homophobia might be unfair. The writer is gay, and his desire to be a parent doesn't contradict that. He's not denying the sister a family, just not being the sperm donor. The process of IVF is available for her, so maybe she can pursue that without him. The writer's main issue is about his own wishes conflicting with her request. \n\nIn terms of ethics, donating sperm is a personal choice. No one can force someone to donate, even close family. The writer is not in the wrong for choosing his own path. However, the way he turned it down and the sister's hurt feelings are part of the conflict. But the core issue is his right to decide. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B. He's not in the wrong because he's making a personal decision based on his own life goals. Even if the sister is upset, it's not his fault for prioritizing his own future.\n"
