Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is refusing because they want to be a parent themselves in the future. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish. The author feels conflicted but doesn't want their child to be raised by someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and personal aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on their own desires and fears. They explained their reasoning clearly: wanting to be a fully involved parent, concerns about adoption and surrogacy in their country, and not wanting to have a child they aren't raising. These are valid personal reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a position where she wants to start a family and is seeking help from her brother. She might feel rejected or hurt, especially given their close relationship. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish if the sister's needs are considered more urgent or if there's an expectation of family support in such matters.\n\nHowever, autonomy is a key factor here. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body. While family expectations can be strong, personal boundaries are important. The author isn't denying the sister a child entirely; they're just declining to be the sperm donor. The sister can explore other options like using an anonymous donor or adopting, though the author mentions adoption is difficult.\n\nI should also consider if the author's reasons are legitimate. The fear of not being a parent and the desire to have a child themselves is a personal decision. It's not about homophobia but about personal life goals. The sister's accusations of jealousy or homophobia might not be fair; the author is prioritizing their own future.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the sister's request is understandable, the author isn't obligated to fulfill it. The decision hinges on individual rights versus family expectations. The author isn't in the wrong because they are making a choice that aligns with their own values and life goals, even if it causes tension. The sister's reaction is hurtful, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own parental aspirations for her benefit.\n"
