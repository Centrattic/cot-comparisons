Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister is a lesbian, married to another woman, and they want to have a child. The author is gay and doesn't want to be a father right now. They're asking the author to donate sperm so the sister can carry the child (since the text says the sperm goes into the sister, not the sister-in-law). But the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves and don't want to be just an uncle. The sister feels rejected and thinks the author is selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help to build a family, and the author is being asked to contribute biologically. It's possible that the author's refusal is seen as not supporting their sibling. But on the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons. They want to be a parent themselves and feel that donating sperm for this situation would deprive them of that dream. \n\nI should consider consent and autonomy. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if they have an excess of sperm. Their desire to be a parent is a personal choice. The sister's need for a child is important, but it's not the author's responsibility to fulfill that. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The sister is upset, and the author feels bad for making her cry. But if the author's feelings are genuine and they've thought it through, then they aren't being selfish. They're prioritizing their own future. \n\nAnother point is the comparison of the author's situation to the sister's. The sister's ability to have a child through IVF might be easier than the author's potential path via adoption or surrogacy. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong to prioritize their own goals. \n\nInternalized homophobia was mentioned. The author had issues accepting their sexuality because they wanted to be a father, which complicates things. But if the author is clear that their reasons are about wanting to be a parent themselves, then it's not about homophobia. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to make personal decisions, the sister's valid desire for a family, and the balance between personal aspirations and family support. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a choice that's important for their own life goals. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own wishes. So the answer should be B for No.\n"
