Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points from the author's perspective. They're 25, their sister is 30, and both are gay. The sister wants to start a family using the author's sperm, which would go into her wife. The author is close to their sister and wants the best for her, but they're uncomfortable because they want to be a dad themselves. They\u2019re worried about not being involved in the child's life and the emotional impact that would have. They also mention the legal and logistical challenges of having children themselves later, which adds to their hesitation.\n\nNow, the sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable. The author is conflicted because they feel they should support their sister, but their own desires and fears are strong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nLooking at this, it's important to recognize that personal decisions about reproduction are deeply personal. The author has the right to prioritize their own future family plans. While donating sperm could be a generous act, it's a significant decision with long-term implications. The author isn't denying the sister the ability to have children entirely; they're just declining a specific request. The sister can explore other options like sperm banks or other donors. \n\nHowever, the author's refusal might be seen as selfish by the sister because they\u2019re close, and family expectations can play a role. But considering the emotional and personal stakes for the author, their decision isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of personal choice and priorities. The author isn't obligated to use their genetic material in a way that conflicts with their own life goals. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is not being supportive enough. But the author did explain their feelings and reasons, which is important. The sister's reaction, while hurtful, is her emotional response, but that doesn't automatically make the author in the wrong. \n\nI should also consider if there's any ethical obligation here. There's no legal obligation, and while family ties are strong, they don't necessarily create a moral duty to donate sperm. The author is making a personal choice that affects their own future. It's a tough spot, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own desires, even if it upsets their sister. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a difficult decision based on their own aspirations and emotional needs, and while it's disappointing for their sister, the author isn't obligated to fulfill this request in a way that compromises their own dreams.\n"
