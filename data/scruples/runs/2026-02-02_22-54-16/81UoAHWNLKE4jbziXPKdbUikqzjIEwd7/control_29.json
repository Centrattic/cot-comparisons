Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, his sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. They're both gay, which is a point they mention with humor. The sister wants to start a family and is asking her brother to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is uncomfortable with this because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He feels that donating sperm would take away his chance to be a full parent. \n\nHe explains that he's not against his sister having kids, but his own desire for parenthood is strong. He mentions that adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal in his country, so his options are limited. He's worried that by donating sperm now, he might regret it later because he won't be involved in the child's life. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's decision is based on his personal desire to be a father. He's making a choice about his own body and future. The sister is in a situation where she wants to have a genetically related child, but she's asking her brother to help. \n\nEthically, there's a balance here. The author isn't obligated to donate his sperm. It's his body, and he has the right to make decisions about his reproductive options. On the other hand, the sister is in a vulnerable position, hoping for a family, and the author is a close family member who had been expected to support her.\n\nBut the author isn't refusing because of prejudice or malice. He's explaining his personal reasons, which are about his own future and emotional well-being. The sister's reaction includes accusations that might be hurtful, but the author's stance isn't necessarily selfish. He's prioritizing his own dreams of parenthood, which is valid. \n\nThe sister's need for a genetic link is understandable, but she's asking her brother to sacrifice his potential for parenthood. There might be alternative solutions, like using a sperm donor, which the author isn't being asked to do. The author isn't dismissing her desire for children but is stating that he can't fulfill the request because it conflicts with his own goals. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. People can't be expected to sacrifice their own aspirations for others, even family members. However, the way the refusal was communicated might have been handled better to minimize hurt feelings. But the core issue is about personal choice and rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. He's making a personal decision based on his own life goals, which is a valid right.\n"
