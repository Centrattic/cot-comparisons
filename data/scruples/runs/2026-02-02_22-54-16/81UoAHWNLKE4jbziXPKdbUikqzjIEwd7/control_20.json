Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. They\u2019re both gay. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would go into the sister-in-law. The author is gay and wants to have kids themselves but doesn't want to be a \"biological uncle\" instead of a dad. They said no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish and using terms like internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for saying no. They feel they want to be fully involved in parenting, not just a biological donor. They mention that adoption is hard and surrogacy isn't legal in their country. The sister is upset, feeling rejected and that the author is prioritizing their own desires over her family-building needs.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, donating sperm is a personal decision. The author has the right to choose based on their own feelings and future plans. The sister's request is valid, but the author isn't obligated to comply. However, the author is close to the sister and the rejection caused emotional pain. \n\nThe sister's hurt feelings are valid too. She might feel that her brother, who is close, is not supporting her family goals. But the author's reasons aren't about not wanting her to have kids; it's about their own desire to be a parent. It's not about homophobia or jealousy as the sister suggests. The author is prioritizing their own future, which is understandable.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The decision is personal, and the author's reasoning, while causing hurt, is based on their own life goals. They aren't being selfish without reason; they have a valid desire to be a parent. The sister's frustration is real, but the author isn't obligated to donate. The key is that the author isn't denying the sister the chance to have kids entirely; they\u2019re just not the right donor for their situation.\n"
