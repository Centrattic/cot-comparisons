Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a gay man, 25 years old. His sister, who's a lesbian married to another woman, is 30 and wants to have a child. She asked him to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is close to his sister and wants the best for her, but he's uncomfortable because he has his own desire to be a father someday. He feels that donating sperm now would mean he's not the parent, and he doesn't want to be just an uncle. He turned her down, and she's upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable. The author is now questioning if he's wrong for saying no.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Donating sperm is a big decision. The author is being asked to give up a part of his potential future as a parent. Even though he has plenty of sperm, the emotional aspect is important. He wants to be actively involved in raising his own children. That's a valid personal desire. On the other hand, his sister wants to have a child with her partner, which is a significant life goal. \n\nBut is it fair to expect a sibling to donate sperm, especially when it conflicts with the donor's own dreams? The sister might feel hurt because they're close, and she expected support. However, the author's reasons are personal and legitimate. He's not denying her the chance to have children, just choosing not to be the sperm donor. The sister's accusation of jealousy or internalized homophobia might be a reaction to her own hurt feelings rather than the author's actual intentions.\n\nLegally, in some places, there are regulations about sperm donation between relatives, which might affect the situation, but the author didn't mention legal issues. The main conflict here is emotional and personal. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if they are close. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. Saying no in this case isn't inherently selfish; it's about personal boundaries and priorities.\n\nHowever, the sister might feel rejected because she sees a way to fulfill her family dream, and the author is the only one who can help in that specific way. But it's important to respect the author's choice. Being in the wrong would depend on whether the author acted unreasonably. Since he's being honest about his feelings and hasn't forced her into anything, he's not in the wrong. The sister's reaction is hurtful, but that doesn't make the author wrong for saying no. He's prioritizing his own future, which is a valid choice. So the answer is B.\n"
