Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister is a 30-year-old lesbian. The sister wants to have a family and asked her brother to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is uncomfortable with the idea because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He turned her down, and she's upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The sister has a valid desire to have children, and using a sibling's sperm is a common option for some couples. However, the author has his own aspirations to be a father and feels that donating sperm would prevent him from experiencing fatherhood. \n\nIs it selfish for him to prioritize his own desires over his sister's? Well, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and future. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even if it's for a family member. His reasons are personal and relate to his life goals. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt because she expected support from her close sibling.\n\nThe sister might see this as a selfless act, but the author is not required to sacrifice his own future for hers. It's important to respect both perspectives. The sister's feelings are valid, but so is the author's right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate or if his decision is a personal choice. Since he explained his reasoning and isn't forcing anyone, he's probably not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that surrogacy and adoption are challenging, the author's decision to hold onto his sperm for future use makes sense for his own plans. The sister's frustration might come from unmet expectations, but the author isn't at fault for having those expectations. He isn't being malicious; he's being honest about his limits. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
