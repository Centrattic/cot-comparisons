Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his lesbian sister and her partner. The author is gay, and the sister wants both her partner and herself to be biologically related to the child. The author's main concerns are about not wanting to be a father in the traditional sense and wanting to have his own kids someday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The sister is upset and feels the author is being selfish. The author argues that his reasons are personal and not about the sister's right to have children. The question is whether his refusal is justified or if he's being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid personal desire to be a parent. His reasoning is that he wants to experience fatherhood fully, which is a legitimate aspiration. Everyone has different life goals, and wanting to have his own biological child is understandable. Also, the fact that he's gay and had issues with his sexuality earlier adds another layer, as he might be dealing with societal pressures or internalized feelings about his role in family.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister sees this as a self-centered refusal, especially considering their close relationship and her need for support. She might feel that he's prioritizing his own future over helping her achieve her dream. There's also the argument that donating sperm isn't a huge sacrifice for him, as he can still have children later, and the sister's need might be more urgent.\n\nBut I should also think about autonomy. The author isn't obligated to donate his sperm. It's a personal decision, and while it's causing family tension, he's not doing anything illegal or unethical. The sister's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. People have the right to say no to requests, even if they come from close family. \n\nAnother angle is the comparison to other situations. If the roles were reversed and the sister asked for money or help, would the author feel differently? If he had refused a financial request, it might be seen as selfish, but in this case, it's a different kind of request. However, the emotional impact is similar. The sister might feel rejected or that her needs are not being considered. \n\nBut the key here is that the author clearly communicated his feelings and reasons. He isn't hiding his refusal; he's being honest. The sister's reaction is understandable given her investment in the request. However, the author's decision is still his to make. The question is whether that decision is morally wrong, not just whether it's causing hurt feelings. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He made a personal choice that aligns with his own desires and future plans. While it's causing conflict, he isn't violating any moral boundaries. The sister's upset is valid, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill her request at the cost of his own aspirations. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
