Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: the author is 25, his sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. They're both gay, and the sister wants to start a family. She asked the author to donate sperm so that the child would have her partner's genes and her own. The author is also gay, so he's not the biological father in a traditional sense here. The key point is that the sperm would go into the sister-in-law, not the sister. \n\nThe author's reasons for refusing are that he wants to have kids himself one day and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He feels that donating would mean he's not the father, and he wants to be fully involved in his own child's life. He mentions that adoption is hard and surrogacy isn't legal in his country. His sister is upset, calling him selfish, and he's questioning if he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The sister has a valid desire to have a child with her partner, which is a common path for same-sex couples using donor sperm. The author's refusal is based on his personal desire to be a parent someday. But is that selfish? Well, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own bodies and future. The sister might feel hurt because they're close, but the author's reasons are personal and valid. \n\nHowever, the sister's needs are also significant. She's in a position where she wants to build a family and might not have many options. The author could consider if there's a middle ground, like donating but not being involved if he ever has his own kids. But he's clear that he wants to be a father, so donating now might take away an option for himself. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, he's not obligated to donate. It's a personal choice. The sister might feel betrayed due to their close relationship, but the author isn't doing anything illegal or morally wrong. His reasons, while they may seem selfish to the sister, are about his own future. So, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he has the right to prioritize his own desires. However, the situation is complex, and there's no black-and-white answer. But the key is that he's not wrong for making a choice that aligns with his personal goals, even if it causes conflict.\n"
