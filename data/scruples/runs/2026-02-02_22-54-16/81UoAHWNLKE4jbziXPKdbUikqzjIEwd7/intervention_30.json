Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The situation involves family dynamics, personal desires, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the author is close to their sister who's a lesbian, and her partner. They were asked to donate sperm so the sister can have a child with her partner. The author is uncomfortable because they want to have their own children someday and don't want to be a \"father\" only in the genetic sense without being involved as a parent. They also mention logistical issues like adoption and surrogacy being difficult in their country.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish. The author feels conflicted between their sister's needs and their own dreams. They argue that their reasons are valid because they want to be a parent, not just a genetic donor. The key here is autonomy and personal choice. Donating sperm is a significant decision that affects the donor's future. The author isn't denying their sister the chance to have a child; they're choosing their own path. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author has the right to make decisions about their body. The sister's request is reasonable, but the author isn't obligated to agree. The sister might feel hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing their own goals. It's about balancing empathy with personal boundaries. The author isn't being selfish if they're honest about their limitations and desires. The sister's accusation of jealousy or homophobia seems unfair, as the author's reasons are about wanting to be a parent themselves. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough choice based on their own aspirations and the realities of their situation. The answer should be B.\n"
