Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the writer is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister is a 30-year-old lesbian who wants to have a child with her wife. She asked her brother to donate sperm so they can have a child with both their genes. The sister-in-law would be the one carrying the child, not the sister. The writer is close to his sister and wants her to be happy, but he's uncomfortable because he also wants to have children himself. He feels that donating sperm would mean the child is raised by someone else (his sister's wife), and he wouldn't be able to experience fatherhood. He's worried about the emotional impact of having a child he can't be a dad to. He declined, and the sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of internalized homophobia and jealousy. The writer is questioning if he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the sister is in a situation where she and her partner want to have a biological child, using the brother's sperm. It's their right to want to start a family, and they might see the brother's help as a way to achieve that. On the other hand, the brother has his own aspirations of fatherhood and feels that donating would compromise his future. \n\nThe key here is consent and personal choice. The sister asked, but the brother isn't obligated to say yes. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body, even if it affects someone they care about. The brother's reasons aren't about not wanting his sister to have kids but about his own desires conflicting. \n\nThe sister's reaction might stem from feeling rejected or not considered. However, the brother isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own wishes. It's possible the sister is feeling a mix of disappointment and hurt, especially if she felt the brother would naturally say yes. But the brother's refusal is about his personal boundaries, which are valid.\n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia might not be justified. The brother isn't denying her the right to have children; he's choosing his own path. It's important to recognize that wanting to be a parent is a personal goal, and there's no inherent wrong in wanting to fulfill that dream. The sister might need to accept that her brother's decision is about his own life plans, not about her not being allowed to have a family.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact on both sides. The brother feels bad for making his sister cry, which shows he cares about her feelings. However, standing by his decision is about being true to himself. The sister's upset might be more about the rejection than the decision itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the brother isn't in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his own aspirations and feelings. The sister's request was valid, but the brother isn't obligated to comply. Both need to respect each other's decisions, even if it's difficult.\n"
