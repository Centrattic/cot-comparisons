I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's partner has a history of adopting dogs behind their back, despite previous discussions about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The latest dog has cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home, but the author resists, feeling manipulated. The author is upset because this pattern of behavior is causing relationship strain and considering ending an 11-year relationship.\n\nThe main issue here is about consent and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author feels their partner is being manipulative by adopting dogs without their input, especially when they've discussed the ideal number of dogs. The partner's actions seem to disregard the author's boundaries and the agreed-upon limit, which the author finds inconsiderate and emotionally manipulative.\n\nThe partner argues that they would help family members in need, but the comparison isn't fair because it's about pets versus people. The author's concern is about the cumulative effect of these decisions on their life and relationship, not just this one instance. The author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're concerned about the partner's pattern of behavior and the impact on their shared life.\n\nThe key factors are: repeated disregard for the author's input, the burden of multiple dogs, and the emotional manipulation. The author is standing their ground against further encroachments on their autonomy. The partner's actions seem to prioritize the dogs over the relationship's health, which the author is now seriously considering ending.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid concerns about the partner's behavior and the impact on their relationship. The partner is the one who acted without consent, despite prior discussions. The author's resistance isn't about the dog itself but the pattern of manipulation and lack of consideration. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
