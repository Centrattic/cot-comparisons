I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, despite previous agreements on the number of dogs they can handle. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed, but they're also considering ending the relationship because of the partner's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's partner has a history of adopting dogs without their consent, even after discussing the ideal number of dogs. The latest dog has cancer, which adds emotional weight. The author feels that bringing the dog home would mean losing an argument to emotional manipulation. They also mention the practical challenges of caring for multiple dogs, which affects their quality of life and plans.\n\nThe partner's actions seem to involve a pattern of behavior\u2014adopting dogs without input, which the author finds manipulative. The foster parent's role in emotionally manipulating the partner is noted, which the author is aware of. The author's reluctance isn't about the dog's well-being but about the partner's disregard for their agreed-upon limits and the resulting stress.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, both parties have valid points. The partner is acting from a place of compassion for the dogs, possibly influenced by the foster parent. However, the author has legitimate concerns about their shared living situation and the agreed-upon number of pets. The author isn't refusing the dog out of selfishness but because they feel their partner isn't respecting their boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the repeated pattern of the partner acting unilaterally despite previous discussions, the author's frustration is justified. The author is trying to uphold the boundaries they've jointly discussed, which is a reasonable expectation in a relationship. The partner's argument about family members needing a place to stay is a comparison that doesn't fully address the specific context of pet adoption and prior agreements.\n\nThe author's decision to not bring the dog home isn't about the dog's immediate needs but about setting a boundary to prevent future manipulation. While the dog's welfare is important, the author's mental health and the relationship's stability are also significant factors. The author isn't acting out of malice but from a place of needing their partner to respect their input and the existing agreements.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner's actions are the primary issue here, as they've repeatedly disregarded the author's input, leading to the current conflict. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n"
