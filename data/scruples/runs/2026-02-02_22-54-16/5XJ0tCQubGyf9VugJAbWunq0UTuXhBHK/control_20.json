I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The author is upset because their partner has a history of emotionally manipulating them into taking in more dogs, which leads to significant stress and affects their quality of life. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner has a pattern of adopting dogs without discussion, even after the couple had agreed on 2-3 being ideal. The author feels that each time, they end up giving in to manipulation, which is straining their relationship. The latest dog has health issues, including possible cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home, which the author is resisting because they don't want to feel like they're losing again.\n\nThe author loves dogs but acknowledges the practical challenges. They mention the difficulty of managing multiple dogs, the impact on their ability to take time off, and the stress involved. The partner's argument is that they would help family in similar situations, but the author sees the comparison as unfair because the issue isn't the dog's plight but the lack of mutual decision-making.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationship dynamics, mutual respect and communication are crucial. The partner's actions repeatedly disregard the author's input, which can be seen as disrespectful. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is a healthy response in a relationship. The partner's behavior includes manipulation and not honoring previous agreements, which is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're trying to manage their responsibilities and the relationship's health. The fact that they're considering ending the relationship due to this pattern shows the severity of the issue. While the author might feel guilty, their stance is about setting boundaries against manipulation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and the agreed-upon rules in the relationship. The partner's actions are the ones that are inconsiderate and manipulative, not the author's.\n"
