I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner who adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because their partner keeps taking in more dogs despite prior agreements and emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for over 11 years. The partner started with six rescues, four of which were special needs. They had discussions that 2-3 dogs would be ideal after two died. Then over the years, the partner took in more dogs without consulting the author. Now there's a seventh, which has cancer, and the author is resistant to bringing it home because they don't want the partner to \"win\" through manipulation.\n\nThe author's main issue is the partner's pattern of behavior\u2014adopting without consent, emotional manipulation, and not respecting boundaries. The partner is using the shop as a temporary home but now wants to bring the dog home overnight. The author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed and that their partner isn't considering their feelings or the practicalities.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the scenario, the partner is clearly acting without consulting the author, which is a breach of trust. The author is standing their ground, which seems reasonable given the prior agreements. The partner's argument that they wouldn't do the same for family isn't a fair comparison because it's about pets versus people. The author's concern is about the partner's manipulation and the impact on their relationship and their ability to manage the dogs. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. They've already made their stance clear and are trying to protect their relationship from being dominated by the partner's actions. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship due to this behavior shows the depth of their frustration.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person is being unreasonable. The author here isn't being cruel to the dog but is instead standing up for their own limits. The partner's actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
