I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, and the author's feelings about it.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author's partner has adopted multiple dogs over the years, often without consulting them. They've discussed keeping the number down to 2-3. The partner's friend manipulates him into taking in more dogs. Now, the seventh one is adopted secretly, and there's cancer involved. The author is angry because they feel manipulated, and they don't want to bring the dog home, fearing it's a win for the partner's behavior.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed. They mention the practical issues of caring for six dogs already, which is a part-time job. They're considering ending the relationship due to this pattern of behavior. The partner argues that if family needed help, they'd do the same, but the author sees it as unfair comparison.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The partner is adopting dogs without consultation, despite prior agreements, and using emotional manipulation. The author is standing their ground, not wanting to enable the behavior by complying. The partner's actions are problematic, and the author is asserting their boundaries. The author's reasoning is about maintaining their own limits and preventing the cycle of manipulation. They're not being cruel to the dog; they're considering the practicalities and the relationship's health.\n\nThe key is whether the author's refusal is justified. The partner's actions are ethically questionable, and the author is trying to protect the relationship by setting boundaries. Even though they love dogs, they can't realistically take in another. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the relationship's health and their own well-being. The partner needs to respect the author's boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
