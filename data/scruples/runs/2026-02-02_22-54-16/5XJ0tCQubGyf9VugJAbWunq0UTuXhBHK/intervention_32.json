I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their consent, and the author is resisting bringing the dog home because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without consulting the author, starting from 4 special needs dogs and increasing to 7. The author mentions that they've discussed multiple times that 2-3 dogs would be ideal. The latest dog has cancer, and the author is reluctant to bring it home because they don't want to feel like they've lost an argument through emotional manipulation. They also mention the stress of managing 6 dogs already, which limits their ability to go away, and the potential of ending an 11-year relationship over this.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about the partner's consistent pattern of unilateral decisions and emotional manipulation. They feel their boundaries are being ignored, which is affecting their quality of life. They love dogs but acknowledge there's a limit. The partner, on the other hand, uses emotional appeals, comparing it to helping family members, which the author finds unfair.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions are definitely problematic\u2014adopting without consent and ignoring previous agreements. The author is standing their ground by not giving in to the manipulation, which is reasonable. They're also considering the practical aspects of caring for more dogs, which shows responsibility. The emotional toll and the impact on their relationship are valid concerns. The author isn't being cruel by not wanting to take in another dog; they're prioritizing their own well-being and relationship health. The partner's manipulation is the key issue here, not the author's refusal. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to set boundaries against a partner who's been inconsiderate and manipulative. The answer should be B.\n"
