I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author. The author is upset because they've discussed keeping the number of dogs at 2-3, especially after some of the previous dogs died. The partner has a history of getting more dogs without the author's input, which the author sees as emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed with six already. The partner keeps getting more dogs, each time with the argument that the dog is in need. The author is frustrated because they feel their boundaries are being ignored. The latest dog has cancer, which adds another layer of emotional stress. The author is also considering ending the relationship, which shows the depth of their distress.\n\nThe partner's actions seem to be about his inability to say no to the foster parent's requests, even when it conflicts with the couple's previous agreements. The author is trying to assert their stance, not wanting to bring the dog home because it feels like giving in to the partner's manipulation. The partner's comparison to family needing help doesn't hold because the context is different\u2014a dog versus a family member's emergency.\n\nI should also think about consent and communication in relationships. Partners should discuss and agree on major decisions, like adopting a pet. The partner's repeated actions without discussion show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author is standing up for themselves, which is important for a healthy relationship. Even if they feel guilty about not taking in the dog, the partner's manipulation is the real issue here.\n\nThe cancer diagnosis adds a tragic element, but the core issue is the partner's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They're prioritizing their own well-being and the relationship's health, which is valid. The partner's actions are the problem, not the author's refusal to bring the dog home without prior agreement. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
