I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner. The main person is upset because they had previously agreed on having 2-3 dogs, and the partner keeps bringing in more without discussing it. The author is resisting bringing the new dog home because they feel it's part of a pattern where the partner uses emotional manipulation to get his way. The latest dog has cancer, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they had discussions multiple times about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3, especially after two of the original six died. The partner has a pattern of adopting more dogs without consulting them, starting with the two puppies five years ago, then another one three years ago, and now this seventh one. The author is frustrated because bringing the new dog home would mean the partner \"wins\" again, reinforcing the feeling of being manipulated. \n\nThe partner argues that if someone in the author's family needed a place to stay, they wouldn't say no. The author counters that the issue isn't the dog itself but the pattern of behavior. They also mention the logistical burden of having so many dogs, which makes them consider ending the 11-year relationship. \n\nNow, assessing whether the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions seem to involve not communicating and possibly manipulating by appealing to the author's compassion for animals. The author is standing their ground to protect their own boundaries and the household's well-being. They're not against helping animals but have limits. The author's reasoning is based on prior agreements and the stress it's causing their relationship. \n\nOn the flip side, could the author be inconsiderate? They are resisting taking in a dog that might be in need, but they did agree to take the dog in initially if it were dying. However, they're worried about future scenarios where the dog might not have cancer, leading to the same pattern. The author's stance is about maintaining boundaries and considering their own capacity, which is understandable. \n\nThe partner's behavior seems to be the main issue here\u2014acting without consultation and using emotional manipulation. The author is trying to set limits, which is a healthy relationship dynamic. The fact that they're considering ending the relationship over this pattern shows the severity of the issue from their perspective. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to enforce boundaries that were previously discussed, and their concerns are valid regarding the impact on their life and the relationship. The partner's actions are the primary problem here, not the author's resistance.\n"
