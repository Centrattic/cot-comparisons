I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner. The key points are the history of multiple dogs, the partner's pattern of adopting without discussion, the emotional manipulation aspect, and the current conflict over the new dog.\n\nFirst, the background mentions they had 6 dogs initially, 4 of which were special needs. After two died, they discussed keeping 2-3 as ideal. The partner has a history of adopting more dogs behind their back, using a foster parent who manipulates them emotionally. This time, the seventh dog has cancer and needs to stay at the partner's business. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and don't want to give in again, which might lead to more dogs when they already have too many.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they love dogs but there's a limit to how many they can handle. The partner's actions are seen as manipulative, going against their previous agreement. The author is resisting to avoid enabling this pattern, even though it's hard emotionally.\n\nThe question is, is the author in the wrong for not allowing the dog to come home? To assess this, we need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should have a say in major decisions, especially those affecting their living situation. The partner adopting without discussion is a breach of trust and the previous agreement. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's argument is that they're helping a dog in need, using the example of helping family. But the comparison isn't fair because the author is being asked to make a personal sacrifice repeatedly, which isn't the same as helping family members. The emotional manipulation here is key\u2014using the dog's needs to pressure the author into compliance.\n\nThe author's hesitation isn't about not caring for the dog, but about the partner's manipulation and the existing overwhelming number of dogs. They're trying to prevent being in a cycle where their partner makes unilateral decisions, which is affecting their relationship. The author's consideration of ending the relationship shows the depth of their distress.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their right to be involved in decisions that affect their shared life and setting boundaries to protect their own well-being. The partner's actions are the issue here, not the author's reluctance.\n"
