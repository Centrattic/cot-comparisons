I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other, and the writer is resisting bringing the dog home because they feel manipulated.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together for 11 years, and the partner has a history of bringing in rescue dogs without discussion. The writer mentions that they had prior agreements about the number of dogs, but the partner keeps adding more, especially with special needs. The latest dog was adopted secretly, and the writer is upset because bringing it home would feel like giving in to emotional manipulation. The dog now has cancer, complicating the decision.\n\nThe writer loves dogs but feels overwhelmed. They can't take time away from home, and the partner's actions are straining the relationship. The writer is considering ending the relationship, but the dogs are a factor in not wanting to be alone with them.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the writer is asserting their boundaries after being taken advantage of repeatedly. The partner's actions are manipulative, as the foster parent seems to know the partner can't say no. The writer's resistance is about self-respect and the agreed-upon limit on dogs. The emotional manipulation is a key point here. The writer's stance isn't about not caring for the dog but about the partner's consistent disregard for their input and the relationship's boundaries.\n\nThe partner's argument that he would help family is not a fair comparison since the issue is about prior agreements and manipulation. The writer's concern is valid, as constant unilateral decisions can erode a relationship. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong; they're standing up for themselves against manipulation and broken agreements. The answer should be B (No).\n"
