I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consent, despite previous agreements on the number of dogs. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed, and now they won't let the dog come home, partly because they don't want to feel like they lost an argument again. The partner's actions seem to be a pattern of emotional manipulation, adopting dogs behind the author's back. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the partner kept adopting dogs against their agreement, the author is standing their ground, and now the dog has cancer. The author is refusing to bring it home because they don't want to feel like they're giving in to manipulation. The partner is using emotional appeals, like comparing it to family needing help, but the author sees it as unfair.\n\nThe author's position seems valid because they had prior discussions about limiting the number of dogs, especially considering the responsibility. The partner's repeated actions without consultation are disrespectful. However, the author is also withholding the dog from a home where it might need care. But the author's reasoning is partly about not yielding to manipulation. They love dogs but have practical limits.\n\nThe partner's behavior is definitely a problem here. Emotional manipulation and not respecting boundaries can be damaging. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is healthy. However, the refusal to bring the dog home might be harsh, especially if the dog is in poor health. But given the partner's history, the author is protecting their own limits. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and patterns. The author's intention is to maintain boundaries after repeated overstepping by the partner. The partner's actions are manipulative. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves, even if the outcome is tough on the dog. The real issue is the partner's behavior, not the author's decision to not give in. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
