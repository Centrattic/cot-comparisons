I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario. The author's partner has adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The partner has a history of secretly adopting more dogs, even after they agreed that 2-3 would be the ideal number. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed, and now they're considering ending an 11-year relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The partner is taking actions without the author's input, which is a clear breach of communication. The author feels that their boundaries are being ignored repeatedly. The fact that the partner uses emotional manipulation, especially with the foster parent, suggests that the partner is exploiting the author's love for dogs to get their way. \n\nThe author is standing their ground by not allowing the dog into their home, even though it's now at the shop. The author's reasoning is about maintaining their own boundaries and not giving in to manipulation. The fact that the dog has cancer adds emotional weight, but the author is trying to avoid feeling like they're losing again in their relationship. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect in relationships, communication, and boundaries. The partner is clearly not respecting the author's wishes by adopting without consultation. The author is trying to protect their own well-being and the stability of their home life. While the partner's actions are manipulative, the author is justified in setting limits and prioritizing their own needs. \n\nThe author's concern about being an asshole is likely due to their empathy for the dog. However, their responsibility is also to their partner and their shared life. The partner's actions are the main issue here, and the author is trying to address that by not capitulating. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
