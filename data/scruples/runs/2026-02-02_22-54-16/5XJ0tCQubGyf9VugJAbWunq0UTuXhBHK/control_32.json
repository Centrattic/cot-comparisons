I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their consent, and the author is refusing to bring it home to avoid giving in to emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The partner already has six rescue dogs, four with special needs. They had agreed on 2-3 dogs moving forward after two deaths. The partner has a history of getting dogs without the author's input, and this latest one has cancer. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and want to avoid the partner winning this time, even though they love dogs and are conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the arguments for and against. On one hand, the partner is clearly acting without considering the author's feelings and the existing agreement. Emotional manipulation is a red flag, especially when it's a recurring pattern leading to significant life changes (like having six dogs). The author's concern about their partner winning again is valid if this is part of a larger issue in their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is resisting an action that might save a dog's life. But the problem isn't just about the dog; it's about the partner's lack of communication and respect for the author's boundaries. The author isn't refusing the dog out of malice but because of the partner's manipulative tactics. They also mention the practical challenges of having more dogs, which is a legitimate concern for their household and well-being.\n\nThe key point here is that the partner's actions are the main issue. The author is standing up for their own boundaries and the agreement they had. The author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're concerned about the partner's behavior. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship shows how serious they take this issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their right to be part of the decision-making process in their shared life. The partner's manipulation is the problem, not the author's refusal to comply without discussion. The author is trying to prevent being taken advantage of repeatedly, which is a valid stance.\n"
