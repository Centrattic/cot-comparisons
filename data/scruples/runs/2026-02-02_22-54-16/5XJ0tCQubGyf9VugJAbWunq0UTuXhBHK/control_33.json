I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the AITA) is in the wrong for not bringing the seventh rescue dog home because they feel manipulated. \n\nFirst, the background: The partner has a history of adopting dogs without consulting the author. They had 6 dogs already, some with special needs. Two died, and they discussed that 2-3 is ideal. Then the partner keeps taking in more, each time without the author's input. The latest dog, the seventh, has cancer and was adopted without the author's knowledge. The partner wants to bring the dog home, but the author is reluctant, fearing it's another win for the manipulative partner.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The partner has a pattern of making decisions about major life changes (like adopting dogs) without the author's input. This is a relationship where both should be on the same page, especially since the author is clearly overwhelmed and there's a history of this happening. The partner's justification about not letting the dog die isn't valid because he didn't consult the author, who is also part of the decision-making.\n\nThe author's concern about manipulation is valid. Emotional manipulation here is about the partner using the dog's situation to get their way without considering the author's input or the existing situation. The author is standing their ground about not wanting more dogs, which is reasonable given the previous discussions about keeping numbers at 2-3. \n\nThe partner's comparison to family members needing a place to stay is a poor one. Family emergencies are different from repeatedly adopting dogs without consent. The author isn't being cruel; they're being realistic about their living situation and their partner's pattern of behavior.\n\nThe author's hesitation isn't about the dog's well-being but about the partner's manipulative behavior. They do love dogs but feel trapped in a cycle where the partner gets their way. Ending the relationship due to these repeated issues is a serious decision, but the root problem is the partner's lack of respect for the author's boundaries and opinions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not refusing the dog out of cruelty. They have a valid reason based on the partner's pattern of behavior and their own limits. The real issue is the partner's actions, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
