I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for not bringing their partner's newly adopted 7th rescue dog home, even though it might have cancer. \n\nFirst, the background: The couple has been together 11 years. The partner already had 6 rescue dogs, 4 with special needs. They discussed keeping 2-3 dogs moving forward. But the partner kept adopting more without consulting the author, leading to 7. The author is frustrated because each time, the partner acts without their input, which they see as emotional manipulation. Now, the dog has cancer, and the author is reluctant to bring it home, fearing they'll \"lose\" the argument again.\n\nSo, key points: The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussion, even after agreed-upon limits. The author is angry about the lack of communication and the increasing burden. The partner is using emotional appeals (cancer, saving a dog) to justify the adoption, which the author feels is manipulation.\n\nThe author's main issue isn't the dog itself\u2014they love dogs\u2014but the pattern of behavior where the partner takes decisions unilaterally, leading to an unsustainable number of pets. The author is considering ending the relationship because this keeps happening. \n\nThe partner's argument is that if family members needed shelter, he wouldn't say no. However, the comparison isn't fair because the dog situation is a repeated pattern, not a one-time event. The author's refusal here is about setting a boundary, not just this specific dog. They're worried that giving in would mean the partner always gets his way through manipulation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're not allowing the dog into their home because of the partner's past behavior. They're protecting their own needs and the previously agreed-upon limits. The partner's actions are the main issue here: ignoring prior discussions, adopting without consent, using emotional tactics. The author is prioritizing their well-being and the household's stability over the dog, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe part about the dog having cancer adds another layer, but the author's reluctance is more about the partner's manipulation than the dog's condition. They\u2019re not opposing the dog's care but the method of acquisition and the pattern of decision-making. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting boundaries against repeated manipulation and considering the household's capacity. The partner's actions are the main problem, not the author's decision to not give in this time.\n"
