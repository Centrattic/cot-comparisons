I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other partner, despite previous agreements about limiting the number of dogs. The key points to consider are communication, boundaries, and emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, the couple had discussed multiple times that having 2-3 dogs was ideal after some of the original dogs died. The partner kept adopting more dogs behind their back, even after the author's objections. The latest dog was adopted without consent, leading to conflict. The author is upset because they feel manipulated into agreeing by bringing the dog home, which would mean the partner \"wins.\" The partner uses emotional appeals, like comparing it to helping family, which the author finds unfair.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed by the responsibility of six already. The partner's repeated actions without consultation are causing significant stress and are leading the author to consider ending the relationship. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the partner is clearly not respecting the author's boundaries and previous agreements. The author is standing their ground by refusing to bring the dog home without being pressured. The partner's actions involve manipulation and not valuing the author's input. The author's reluctance isn't about the dog itself but about the partner's behavior. Since the partner is the one repeatedly breaking agreed-upon limits and using emotional manipulation, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries and protect their own limits, especially in a long-term relationship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
