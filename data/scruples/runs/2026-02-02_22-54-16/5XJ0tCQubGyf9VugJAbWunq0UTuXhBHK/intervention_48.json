I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The question is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the partner adopted a seventh dog without consulting the author. The author had previously agreed that 2-3 dogs were ideal after some died. The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind their back, now up to seven. The last one is from a foster parent who knows he can't say no. The dog has cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home, but the author is upset because it feels like another \"victory\" for the partner's emotional manipulation. The author loves dogs but can't handle the responsibility anymore, leading to considering ending the 11-year relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are the repeated adoption without consent, the manipulative behavior by the foster parent, the current situation where the author is resisting to avoid feeling manipulated again, and the impact on their living situation and relationship.\n\nThe partner's actions are clearly a pattern of ignoring the author's input, leading to an unsustainable number of dogs. The author is standing their ground, which is about setting boundaries. The partner is trying to justify it by comparing to helping family, but that's not the same. The author's refusal isn't about the dog's fate but about respecting their previous agreement and not being manipulated. Given the history and the current strain on their relationship, the author's position seems valid. They're prioritizing their own well-being and the functional aspect of the relationship, which is important. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
