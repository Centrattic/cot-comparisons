I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, leading to tension in the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The partner and the author have been together for 11 years. Initially, there were six rescue dogs, four of which had special needs. They had discussed that 2-3 dogs would be the ideal number moving forward. However, the partner has continued to adopt more dogs over the years, each time without the author's consent. The latest dog, the seventh, was taken in without informing the author, and now it's discovered to have cancer. The author is reluctant to bring it home because they feel their partner is using emotional manipulation to get his way again. The partner owns a small retail shop and says the dog will stay there overnight, but the author is conflicted because bringing it home might mean \"losing\" the argument, and they're considering ending the relationship over this.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author feels their partner is disregarding their input and the prior agreements they had. The partner, on the other hand, is acting out of compassion for the dog, believing they can't say no to animals in need. But the author feels that the partner's actions are inconsiderate and manipulative, leading to significant strain on their partnership.\n\nI should consider if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let the dog stay at home. The partner intended to keep the dog at his business, but the author is upset about the unilateral decision. The author's reasons include the prior agreements, the stress of managing too many dogs, and feeling manipulated. The partner's argument is that he wouldn't say no to family, implying the dog's situation is similar. However, the comparison to family members might not be fair because the author's partner is adopting the dog, not just hosting a family member temporarily.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they have consistently communicated their concerns about the number of dogs and the prior agreements. The partner's repeated actions of adopting dogs without discussion have likely caused the issue. The author is trying to maintain the boundaries they've set, which is reasonable. While they care about the dog, they also need to consider their own well-being and the relationship's stability. The emotional manipulation and lack of respect for agreed-upon limits are on the partner's side. \n\nHowever, the author's consideration of the dog's fate (not wanting it to be put down) is a factor. But they are not obligated to make sacrifices if those agreements are not respected. The partner should have discussed the adoption first. The author's reluctance isn't about the dog's well-being but the partner's pattern of behavior. So, the author isn't being an asshole here. They're standing up for their own needs and the relationship's health.\n"
