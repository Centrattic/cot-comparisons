I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements and the existing burden of caring for six dogs, four of which are special needs.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the repeated instances where the partner adopted dogs without discussion. The couple had agreed that two to three dogs would be ideal after some of the original dogs died. The partner's actions seem to disregard this agreement, especially since it's the seventh dog. The foster parent is described as emotionally manipulating the partner, which the partner can't say no to. \n\nThe author is angry because they feel their partner is being inconsiderate and manipulative. They put their foot down about the seventh dog staying at the business, but the partner is trying to bring it home, which the author resists because they don't want to feel like they're giving in to manipulation. The added stress of the dog having cancer complicates things further. The author is considering ending an 11-year relationship due to this pattern, which is a significant detail.\n\nThe author's main argument is about respecting boundaries and mutual decision-making. The partner didn't consult them, breaking previous agreements. The author's refusal to bring the dog home is a way to maintain their stance against the manipulation. They also mention the practical challenges of caring for six dogs already, making a seventh one impossible without prior discussion.\n\nThe partner's justification uses an analogy about family, but the author finds it unfair because the issue isn't just helping the dog but the pattern of unilateral decisions. The author's dilemma is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to give in, even though they care about animals.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for their needs and the agreed-upon boundaries. The partner's actions are the main issue here\u2014disregarding agreements and engaging in manipulative behavior. The author is not wrong for prioritizing their relationship and practical limits over the dog, especially when the partner hasn't respected their input before. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
