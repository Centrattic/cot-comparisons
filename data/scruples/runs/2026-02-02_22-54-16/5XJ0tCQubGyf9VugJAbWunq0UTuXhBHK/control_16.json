I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong after their partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The partner has a history of adopting rescue dogs without consulting the author, despite previous discussions about keeping the number around 2-3. The latest dog was adopted behind the author's back, and the author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed. The partner argues that if someone in the author's family needed help, they wouldn't refuse, but the author sees the dog situation differently. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this pattern.\n\nThe main issue here is about consent and communication in a relationship. When partners make major decisions without consulting each other, especially when it's a recurring issue, it can lead to resentment. The partner's actions seem to be a pattern: adopting dogs without discussion, leading to a significant number of dogs that strain their resources and time. The author is setting a boundary by not allowing the new dog into their home, which is a reasonable response to protect their own well-being.\n\nThe author's concern about being manipulated is valid if the partner has a pattern of acting unilaterally despite previous agreements. The emotional manipulation angle comes into play if the partner uses the dogs' needs to guilt-trip the author into compliance. The author's hesitation to bring the dog home, especially after learning it might have cancer, isn't about the dog itself but about the recurring dynamic in their relationship. The author is prioritizing their own mental health and the stability of their household, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author does love dogs and is conflicted because they don't want the dog to suffer. But their primary issue is with the partner's lack of communication and respect for their agreed-upon limits. The partner's actions repeatedly disregard the author's input, which is a significant relationship problem. The author's refusal to bring the dog home is a stand against this pattern, not an act of cruelty toward the animal.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re trying to maintain boundaries in a relationship where those boundaries have been consistently ignored. The partner's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's refusal to accommodate an additional dog without prior agreement. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
