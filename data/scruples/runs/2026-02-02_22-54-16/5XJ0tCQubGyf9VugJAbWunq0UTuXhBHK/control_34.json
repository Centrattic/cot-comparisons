I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge, and now the author is conflicted about bringing it home due to emotional manipulation and the existing dog situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already has 6 rescue dogs, including some with special needs. They had previously agreed that 2-3 dogs would be ideal after two died. Then over the years, the partner started getting more dogs without consulting the author, up to seven. The latest one has cancer and is a three-legged dog. The partner wants to bring it home, but the author is resisting because they feel manipulated and don't want to give in again. They're considering ending the relationship due to this pattern.\n\nThe author's main points are about the partner's consistent disregard for their input and the stress of managing too many dogs. They feel manipulated by the foster parent and the partner's unilateral decisions. They also mention that their love for dogs has limits and that the current number is overwhelming.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They have a valid concern about the number of dogs and the prior agreement. The partner's repeated actions without consultation show a pattern of not respecting their boundaries. The emotional manipulation by the foster parent is a red flag, and the partner enabling that by taking more dogs without discussion is a problem. The author's reluctance to bring the seventh dog home isn't about not caring for the dog but about the partner's manipulation and the unsustainable situation. Their feelings of being overwhelmed and considering ending the relationship are significant factors.\n\nFrom the partner's perspective: He might see himself as helping animals in need, especially those with health issues who might otherwise be euthanized. He might believe that the author is being selfish or not compassionate enough. However, the pattern of adopting without consent and the emotional manipulation (using the dog's potential death as a guilt trip) could be seen as manipulative tactics to get their way.\n\nThe key here is the pattern of behavior. The partner has adopted multiple dogs without consulting the author, breaking prior agreements. The author is standing their ground now, which is reasonable given the history. The partner's argument about family needing a place to stay isn't a fair comparison because it's about people versus animals, and the context of manipulation.\n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries after repeated disregard. They're also considering the financial and emotional strain of having six dogs already. The fact that the latest dog has cancer adds to the burden, and the author's hesitation is about the partner's manipulation rather than the dog itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their own well-being and the agreed-upon boundaries. The partner's actions are the issue here, not the author's resistance.\n"
