I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. They already had six dogs, four of which were special needs, and they had discussed keeping it to two or three. The partner has a history of getting dogs behind the author's back, which the author sees as emotional manipulation. Now, the new dog has cancer, and the author is angry about having to bring it home, fearing it's another win for the partner's manipulative behavior.\n\nFirst, the key points: the partner consistently acts unilaterally, ignoring prior agreements. The author is concerned about the number of dogs and the impact on their lives, like not being able to leave the house for long periods. The author's stance is that they won't let the dog come home, keeping it at the partner's business. The partner argues that if family needed a place to stay, he'd help, implying the author's objection is about the dog, not the partner's actions.\n\nThe author is struggling with whether their decision to not bring the dog home is justified, given the partner's past behavior. They're considering ending the relationship because of this pattern.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about boundaries and communication. The partner repeatedly goes against mutual agreements, which is a breach of trust and respect. The author is setting a boundary by not allowing the dog home without consultation. The partner's actions are manipulative, using the dog's plight to get their way despite prior discussions. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel by not bringing the dog home immediately. They are standing up for their own limits, which is important in a relationship. The partner's behavior is the main issue here. The author's hesitation isn't about the dog's welfare but about the partner's manipulative tactics. The author's perspective is valid in maintaining their boundaries, especially after years of the partner ignoring their input.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting their relationship and their own well-being by not giving in to the partner's manipulation. The partner's actions are the problem here, not the author's decision to enforce boundaries.\n"
