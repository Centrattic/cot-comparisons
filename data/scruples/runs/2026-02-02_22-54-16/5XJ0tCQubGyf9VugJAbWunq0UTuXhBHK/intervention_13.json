I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The author is upset because their partner has a history of adopting more dogs behind their back, and they feel it's a form of emotional manipulation. They're holding out on bringing the dog home, partly because of the emotional victory thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they've discussed the ideal number of dogs as 2-3, and the partner has gotten multiple dogs without their knowledge. The seventh dog has cancer now, and the author is conflicted about bringing it home. They don't want to give in because they feel pressured again. The partner argues that if family needed help, he wouldn't say no, but the author sees it as a different situation.\n\nThe author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed with the existing number. They're considering ending the relationship due to this pattern. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the partner's actions: adopting dogs without discussion, especially when they had prior agreements. The partner's actions could be seen as dismissive of the author's boundaries and contributing to their stress. The author's refusal to bring the dog home might be seen as prioritizing their own well-being and boundaries over the dog's immediate needs, but they're also concerned about the partner's manipulation. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the emotional impact and the practical aspects of caring for so many dogs. They're not opposed to helping a dog in need but feel that the partner's actions undermine their input. The partner's argument about family doesn't hold weight because the situations aren't the same. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for their boundaries after repeated disregard from the partner. They're not being cruel to the dog but are setting limits to prevent being manipulated again. The partner's actions are more problematic here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
