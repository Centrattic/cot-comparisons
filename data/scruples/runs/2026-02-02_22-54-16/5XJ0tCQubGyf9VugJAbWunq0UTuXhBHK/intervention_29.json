I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term partner who keeps adopting rescue dogs without consulting the other partner. The author is upset because they had agreed that having 2-3 dogs was ideal, but the partner has gotten a seventh one behind their back. The author is resisting bringing the newest dog home, even after finding out it has cancer, because they feel it's another instance of emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for over 11 years. The partner has a history of adopting multiple rescue dogs, some with special needs. There were prior agreements about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The partner continued to adopt more without consulting the author. The latest dog was adopted secretly, and the author is reluctant to bring it home, not out of malice but because they feel it's a pattern of manipulation and overstepping.\n\nThe author's main argument is about the lack of communication and the partner's tendency to make unilateral decisions. They feel that their input is consistently ignored, leading to a strain on the relationship. The partner, on the other hand, seems to justify his actions by comparing it to helping family in need, but the author doesn't see that comparison as fair because the issue is the manipulation and lack of discussion.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is standing their ground on a decision they feel is important for their household. They're not willing to compromise because they see it as a pattern of behavior that's harmful. The partner's actions involve making major life decisions without consulting the other person, which can be seen as disrespectful. The author is trying to maintain boundaries, which is understandable. The fact that they're considering ending the relationship because of this behavior shows how much this issue is affecting them.\n\nThe partner's justification is that they can't say no to dogs in need, but the author points out that there's a limit to how many they can responsibly handle. The author's stance is about respecting their agreement and not being manipulated into agreeing through emotional means. The author isn't against helping animals generally, but they have specific limits that are being ignored.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not in the wrong because they are asserting their boundaries and standing up for their part of the agreement. The partner's actions are the ones that are problematic, as they're repeatedly disregarding the author's input. The author's reluctance to bring the dog home isn't about not caring for the dog but about not wanting to capitulate to manipulation. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
