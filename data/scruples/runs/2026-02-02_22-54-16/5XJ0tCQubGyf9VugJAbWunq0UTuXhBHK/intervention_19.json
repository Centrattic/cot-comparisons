I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this.\n\nThe situation is about a long-term partner relationship where the partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author. The author is upset because they've discussed keeping the number of dogs to 2-3, especially after some of the previous dogs died. The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind the author's back, often influenced by a foster parent who uses emotional manipulation. Now, the latest dog has cancer, and the author is resisting bringing it home because they don't want to give in to the partner's manipulation again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author values communication and mutual agreement in decisions, especially about pets which require significant care. The partner, on the other hand, continues to adopt more dogs despite previous discussions, which the author feels is manipulative and inconsiderate. The author's hesitation to bring the dog home is not because they don't care about the dog but because of the pattern of behavior that disregards their input and makes their life more difficult.\n\nThe partner argues that they would help family members in need, but the author sees the situation as different. The author's main issue isn't the dog itself but the lack of respect for their boundaries and the recurring pattern of the partner getting their way without discussion. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this, which shows the depth of their frustration.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for their boundaries. They have valid reasons based on the prior agreements and the impact on their lives. The partner's actions repeatedly disregard the author's input, which is a key point in a relationship. The author's decision to not bring the dog home isn't about the dog's well-being (since they care) but about maintaining their autonomy in decisions. The partner's manipulation and lack of consultation are the main issues here.\n\nThe author is not being unreasonable. They have a history of this happening, so their reluctance to give in again is justified. The emotional manipulation by the partner is a significant factor, and the author is trying to set a boundary to prevent future issues. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
