I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge, despite prior agreements to keep things at 2-3 dogs. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed by the number of dogs already.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without consulting the author, which started with 6 dogs, four of which had special needs. They had multiple discussions about keeping it at 2-3. The latest dog was adopted behind the author's back, and now there's cancer involved. The author is reluctant to bring it home because they feel it's another win for the partner's manipulation. \n\nThe partner argues that if someone in the author's family needed help, he wouldn't say no. But the author sees the dog situation as different. The author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed by the existing six, which require constant attention. The partner's actions are leading the author to consider ending the 11-year relationship due to this recurring issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the details, the author is standing their ground on a boundary they've set multiple times. They're not being cruel to the dog; they want it to stay at the business. The partner is using emotional manipulation, which the author is resisting. The author's stance is about setting limits and not giving in to manipulation. \n\nI think the author is justified in their position. They have a valid concern about the number of dogs and the impact on their life. The partner's actions repeatedly disregard their input, which is a pattern of behavior. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to bring another dog home against their will, especially since they've already reached an agreement on the number. The partner is the one acting inconsiderately by not consulting, not respecting boundaries, and using emotional manipulation. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
