I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their partner adopted a seventh dog without consulting them. The author is upset because this is a pattern; their partner has a history of getting rescue dogs without their input, and now the author is resisting bringing the new dog home, partly due to feeling like they're losing again to emotional manipulation.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the pattern of behavior. The partner has adopted multiple dogs without the author's knowledge, despite previous discussions about limiting the number to 2-3 due to the existing special needs dogs. The author feels manipulated and overwhelmed, especially since managing six dogs is already a significant responsibility. The seventh dog has health issues, and the partner wants to bring it home, which the author resists, not just because of the dog's condition but because of the partner's repeated inconsiderate actions.\n\nThe author's main concern is about the partner's lack of communication and the emotional manipulation involved. They feel their boundaries are being disrespected. The partner, on the other hand, argues that they help when family needs it, implying inconsistency. But the author counters that the issue is not about helping in an emergency but about the manipulative pattern and lack of collaboration.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they are validly asserting their limits. They've tried to discuss and set boundaries, but the partner repeatedly ignores them. The author's reluctance to bring the dog home isn't about the dog's welfare but about standing up for their own needs and the health of the relationship. The partner's actions are undermining the author's agency and contributing to the strain on the relationship. The author is justified in their reaction and doesn't need to feel guilty for setting these boundaries, even if it's hard. So, the answer should be B.\n"
