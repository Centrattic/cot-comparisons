I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-term relationship where the partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements on the number of dogs. The writer is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had six dogs, four of which were special needs. They discussed multiple times that two to three dogs would be ideal. But the partner kept adopting more, each time without the writer's knowledge. The latest dog has cancer, and the writer is reluctant to bring it home because they feel it's another victory for the partner's manipulation.\n\nThe writer loves dogs but feels there's a limit. They mention that six dogs are already a part-time job, making it hard to leave the house for more than 8 hours. They're considering ending the relationship due to this behavior. The partner uses emotional appeals, like comparing it to family needing help, but the writer isn't convinced.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides. The partner's actions: adopting dogs without consent, possibly manipulating through emotional tactics, and going against agreed-upon numbers. The writer's actions: standing their ground, setting boundaries by not allowing the seventh dog into the home, and seeking to maintain their limits.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The partner didn't consult the writer before adopting more dogs, breaking previous agreements. The writer's refusal isn't just about the dog but about respecting their own boundaries and the partnership's prior decisions. The writer is prioritizing their well-being and the existing commitments they've made together. The partner's actions could be seen as dismissive of the writer's input and contributing to a pattern of behavior that strains the relationship.\n\nThe writer's reluctance isn't about not caring for the dog but about the partner's manipulation and the unsustainable situation. They're trying to enforce the earlier agreements, which the partner has repeatedly ignored. The partner's argument about family needing help isn't equivalent because it's a different context\u2014adoption vs. emergency family support. The writer is valid in feeling that their voice isn't respected.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and the boundaries they've discussed. The partner's actions are the main issue here, not the writer's response. So the answer should be B.\n"
