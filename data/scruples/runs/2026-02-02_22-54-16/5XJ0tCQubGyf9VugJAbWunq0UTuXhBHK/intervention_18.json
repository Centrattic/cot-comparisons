I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, and the author is resisting bringing the dog home to avoid giving in to what they see as emotional manipulation. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The partner has adopted several dogs over the years without discussing with the author, even after they agreed on having 2-3 dogs. The latest dog was adopted behind the author's back, and now they're dealing with the consequences. The author feels that their partner's actions are manipulative and inconsiderate, especially since managing six dogs is already a full-time job.\n\nThe author's main concern is not just about the number of dogs but about the lack of communication and the partner's pattern of behavior. They feel that every time the partner brings in a new dog, it's done without their input, using emotional appeals (like the dog being in danger, needing a home, etc.). The author is holding the line here to avoid giving in again, which they see as losing to manipulation. \n\nThe partner, on the other hand, argues that they would do the same for family members, comparing the situation to helping a person in need. But the author counters that the issue isn't the dog itself but the process and the pattern of behavior. The author is also considering ending the relationship due to this ongoing issue, which shows the depth of their frustration.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions of adopting without consultation are clearly problematic. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is a healthy thing in a relationship. The author's hesitation isn't about not caring for the dog but about respecting their own limits and the previous agreement. \n\nThe partner's behavior of constantly adding dogs without discussion is the main problem here. The author's decision to not bring the dog home is a boundary they're setting, which is necessary when there's a history of inconsiderate actions. Even though the dog has cancer, the author's concern about being manipulated again is valid. They're not being cruel to the dog; they're addressing the systemic issue in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in setting boundaries against a partner who repeatedly acts without consultation, especially when it affects their shared life significantly. The partner's manipulation and lack of consideration are the core issues here.\n"
