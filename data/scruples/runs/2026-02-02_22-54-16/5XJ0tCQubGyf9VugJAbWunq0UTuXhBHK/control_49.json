I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, despite previous agreements about the number of dogs they should have. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the facts. The couple has been together for 11 years. They had 6 dogs initially, four of which were special needs. Two died, leading them to agree on 2-3 dogs moving forward. The partner, however, adopted three more dogs without the author's knowledge, bringing the total to seven. The latest one is at the partner's business but needs to come home, which the author resists because they don't want to give in to manipulation. The dog also has cancer now, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated pattern of the partner adopting dogs without discussion, the author's concern about the number of dogs and their impact on their life, and the emotional manipulation aspect. The author feels that their partner's actions are inconsiderate and that they're being manipulated into agreeing by doing what's seen as the morally right thing (saving the dog). \n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's main argument is about the partner's pattern of behavior, not the individual dog. They love dogs but have limits, and the partner's actions have led to a situation where their lives are heavily impacted. The partner, on the other hand, is using emotional manipulation (the dog might die if not taken in) to get their way, which the author resists. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the partner is violating previous agreements and not respecting the author's input. The author is standing their ground regarding their boundaries. The partner's justification using the author's family analogy is flawed because it's not the same; the author is talking about their partner's actions versus someone else's family needing help. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel by not taking in the dog immediately. They're considering the long-term impact and the ongoing pattern of manipulation. The fact that the dog has cancer adds complexity, but the author's hesitation isn't about the dog's well-being per se but about the partner's manipulative tactics. \n\nIn AITA cases, the focus is on whether the person's actions are justified. The author isn't doing anything wrong; they're trying to set boundaries in a relationship where those boundaries are continually being ignored. The partner is the one acting inconsiderately and manipulatively. The author's feelings are valid, and their decision to prioritize their own well-being and the earlier agreements is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
