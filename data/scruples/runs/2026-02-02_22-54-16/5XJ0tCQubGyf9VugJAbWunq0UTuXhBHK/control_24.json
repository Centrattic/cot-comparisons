I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their knowledge, and the author is refusing to bring it home, partly because of past manipulation and the number of dogs they already have.\n\nFirst, the key points: The partner has a history of adopting dogs behind the author's back, despite previous agreements. They had discussions about keeping the number of dogs to 2-3. The partner's friend, the foster parent, is described as emotionally manipulating him. The latest dog has cancer, and the partner wants to bring it home overnight, staying at his business until midnight. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and overwhelmed with the existing 6 dogs, which are already a part-time job. The author is considering ending the relationship due to this behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is standing their ground, refusing to bring the seventh dog home, which they see as the partner getting his way again. They love dogs but feel there's a limit. The partner, on the other hand, is adopting more dogs without consent, which is a breach of trust and agreement. The author's refusal is based on practical concerns and past agreements, not just emotional resistance. The partner's comparison to family needing help isn't fair because the context is different\u2014this is about repeated manipulation and breaking agreements. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the sustainability of their shared living situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner is the one violating agreements and using emotional manipulation. The author's stance is about setting boundaries and maintaining trust in the relationship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
