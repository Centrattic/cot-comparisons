I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without their consent. The author is upset because they had previously discussed keeping the number of dogs down to 2-3, especially after some of the original dogs died. They mention that the partner has been getting dogs behind their back multiple times over the years, and the latest dog is even sick with cancer. The author is holding out because they don't want the partner to \"win\" by manipulating them emotionally again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves dogs but feels overwhelmed with the current number (6 already). They had agreements with their partner about reducing the number. The partner kept adopting more without discussing it, which is a breach of trust. The author is prioritizing their relationship and their own mental health by not wanting to cave in again. They're also considering ending the 11-year relationship because of this ongoing issue.\n\nNow, the partner's side: he's taking in dogs in need, which is a kind act, but only after the author's consent. The author feels manipulated because the partner is using emotional appeals to get their way. The partner's argument about helping someone in need (like the author's family) isn't a fair comparison because a dog isn't a person, and the author is talking about long-term commitment versus a temporary stay. Also, the partner didn't consult the author each time, leading to a pattern of behavior that's causing strain.\n\nThe author is being honest about their feelings and the stress the dogs cause. They're not being cruel by keeping the dog at the shop; they're trying to find a balance between compassion for the animal and their relationship. The fact that they're considering ending the relationship because of this manipulation shows that they're trying to communicate their needs. They're not refusing help to the dog entirely\u2014keeping it at the shop is a compromise. However, the author is still holding out because of the emotional toll and not wanting to be controlled again. \n\nThe partner's actions of adopting dogs without discussion are definitely problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They're standing up for themselves and their needs, which is important in a healthy relationship. The key is mutual respect and communication. The partner didn't respect the author's input, and the author is now asserting their stance. There's no indication the author is being cruel to the animals, just that they're trying to manage their living situation and relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner's manipulative behavior and lack of communication are the main issues. The author is trying to protect their relationship and their well-being by not giving in without discussion. The answer should be B.\n"
