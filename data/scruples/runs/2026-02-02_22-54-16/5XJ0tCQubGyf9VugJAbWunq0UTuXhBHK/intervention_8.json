I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by going through the details.\n\nThe author's partner has adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. They already had six dogs, four of which are special needs. The author is upset because they had discussed keeping the number of dogs at 2-3. The partner has a history of taking in more dogs behind the author's back, using emotional manipulation, like introducing a dog in need to get the author to agree. Now, the latest dog has cancer, and the author is resisting bringing it home because they don't want to give in again. They're considering ending the relationship over this issue.\n\nFirst, the partner's actions: repeatedly adopting dogs without discussion, using emotional manipulation. That seems like a problem. The author has valid concerns about the number of dogs being unsustainable and the strain on their relationship. The partner's behavior is manipulative, pushing the author into decisions they didn't agree to. \n\nThe author's stance is about maintaining boundaries and not letting their partner win through manipulation. Even though they love dogs, they have practical limits. They're not being cruel by not taking in the dog; they're standing up for their own needs. The partner's argument comparing the dog to a family member needing shelter isn't fair because it's not the same situation. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and the partner's pattern of behavior.\n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate here. They're trying to set boundaries in a relationship where the partner keeps overriding their input. It's about respecting each other's decisions and working together. The partner isn't respecting the author's wishes, leading to this conflict. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their limits and not giving in to manipulation, especially when it's affecting their quality of life and the relationship's health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner's actions are the main issue here. The author is just trying to protect their own boundaries and the relationship's integrity.\n"
