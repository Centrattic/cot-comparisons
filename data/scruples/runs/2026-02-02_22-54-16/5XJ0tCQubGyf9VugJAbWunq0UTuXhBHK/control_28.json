I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the situation is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the author. The author is upset because they had previously discussed that 2-3 dogs are ideal, and the partner has a history of getting more dogs without their input. The latest dog has possible cancer, and the author is hesitant to bring it home because they feel it's a win for the partner's manipulation. The author is considering ending the 11-year relationship due to this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the partner acted without discussing, there's a pattern of behavior, and the author's reasons for resisting. The author emphasizes the practical issues (too many dogs, time commitments) and the emotional manipulation aspect. They also mention the potential harm to the dog if returned, but still feel conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to bring the dog home. The partner's actions clearly disregarded the author's input, which is a problem. The author's reasons are about setting boundaries and practicality. They love dogs but have limits. The partner's argument about family needing a place to stay isn't a direct comparison, as the author sees it as about manipulation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the partner is at fault for not communicating and going against agreed-upon limits. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is reasonable. The author isn't being cruel to the dog; they're trying to balance the partner's impulsive decisions. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship shows the seriousness of the issue. The author's stance isn't about not caring for the dog but about respecting mutual agreements and their own limits. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
