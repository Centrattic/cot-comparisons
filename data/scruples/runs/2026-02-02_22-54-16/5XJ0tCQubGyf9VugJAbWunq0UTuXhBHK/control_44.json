I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The author is a partner in an 11-year relationship who's upset because their partner kept adopting rescue dogs without their consent, leading up to a seventh one with cancer. The author is resisting bringing the dog home, feeling it's a manipulation tactic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussion, despite previous agreements to have 2-3 dogs. The author feels manipulated and that their boundaries are being ignored. The key points are the lack of communication, the emotional manipulation, and the author's right to set boundaries.\n\nThe partner's actions\u2014adopting without consent\u2014violate mutual agreements. The author is standing up for their position, which is valid because couples should make joint decisions, especially about major commitments like pets. The author's concern isn't about the dog's fate but about the recurring pattern of manipulation. Even though they love dogs, they have legitimate reasons for limit due to the workload. The author's refusal to comply isn't about not caring but about maintaining respect in the relationship. Ending the relationship due to these unresolved issues shows they're prioritizing their well-being, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue the author is being harsh by not allowing the dog home, but the underlying issue is about respect and communication. The partner's behavior is the main problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing their needs. So, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
