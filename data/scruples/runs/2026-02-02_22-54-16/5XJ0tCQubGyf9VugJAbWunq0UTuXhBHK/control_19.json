I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The key points here are the repeated instances of the partner bringing in more dogs without discussion, despite prior agreements that 2-3 dogs is the ideal number. The author feels that the partner is emotionally manipulated, especially by the foster parent who seems to take advantage of his soft spot for rescues. The latest dog has cancer, which adds emotional weight, and the partner wants to bring it home, but the author resists, fearing it's another victory for the partner's manipulative behavior.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about the uncommunicated decisions, the impact on their life (like not being able to take vacations, constant care demands), and the stress of managing so many dogs. They also mention that they love dogs but there's a limit. They're considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing issue.\n\nThe partner's side is that he can't say no to dogs in need, using the example of family needing a place to stay. But the author counters that it's different because the dog is being used as a manipulative tactic. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is standing their ground on not wanting to take in more dogs without discussion. They've set boundaries before, but the partner continues to bypass them. The author is not being inconsiderate but is instead upholding their previous agreements and their own limits. The partner's actions are the problem here\u2014acting unilaterally and using emotional manipulation. The author's resistance isn't about not caring for the dog but about respecting their own limits and the partnership's decisions. \n\nThe author isn't being an asshole here. They're asserting their needs and boundaries, which are valid, especially given the prior discussions. The partner's behavior is the issue, not the author's refusal to comply without discussion. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
