I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting them, leading to tension and relationship issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner has a history of adopting dogs without discussing it, going from 6 to 7. The author feels manipulated and overwhelmed, mentioning that managing 6 dogs is a part-time job. They're considering ending the relationship because of this behavior. The author refuses to bring the new dog home, even when it's discovered to have cancer, because they don't want to feel they've \"lost\" to their partner's manipulation.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the partner's actions seem to be the main issue. Adopting a dog without consulting their long-term partner, especially when they had prior discussions about limiting the number of dogs to 2-3, shows disregard for the author's input. The author is standing their ground, which is reasonable given the existing stress and responsibilities. The author's hesitation about bringing the dog home isn't about the dog's well-being (they mention they love dogs) but about the partner's manipulative behavior. The partner's comparison to family needing a place to stay isn't fair because it's about a pet and past patterns of unilateral decisions.\n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate of the dog's welfare; they're concerned about the partner's manipulative tactics and the cumulative impact on their relationship. They're also being realistic about their ability to manage the existing dogs. Ending an 11-year relationship over this could be drastic, but the author's reasons are based on consistent disrespect and lack of consideration from the partner.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the partner's actions, not the author's response. They're trying to set boundaries after repeated inconsiderate acts. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
