I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis of the situation where the author's partner adopted a seventh rescue dog without consulting them. The author is upset because they feel manipulated and the situation is becoming unmanageable.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple has been together for 11 years. The partner already had six rescue dogs, four of which had special needs. They had discussed that 2-3 dogs were ideal after two of them died. The partner has been getting dogs behind the author's back, starting with two puppies five years ago, then another three years ago, and now a seventh. The author feels that the partner is using emotional manipulation, especially through a foster parent who contacts the partner directly, knowing he can't say no. The latest dog has cancer and the partner wants to bring it home, but the author refuses because they don't want to feel like they've given in again.\n\nThe author's main points are about feeling disrespected and overwhelmed. They love dogs but feel the partner is making unilateral decisions, leading to a part-time job situation with the dogs, no vacations, and the author considering ending the relationship. The partner's argument is that he would do the same for family, but the author thinks that's not a fair comparison.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The partner's actions of adopting dogs without consultation seem to be the core issue. The author is setting a boundary by not allowing the dog into the home, which is their right. The partner's manipulation is evident in taking dogs without discussing, and the author is standing their ground. The fact that the author is considering leaving the relationship suggests significant distress. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The partner hasn't respected the author's input, leading to the author feeling like they lose every time. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially when the partner's actions have been manipulative. The partner's behavior is the main problem here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
