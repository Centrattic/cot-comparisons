I put my foot down and won't let him bring it home -- it stays at his business alone overnight. We just discovered it has cancer and I still don't want to bring it home because then I \"lose\" to his emotional manipulation yet again.\n**Background:**\n\n* Partner and I together for 11+ years\n* He had 6 rescue dogs at the start, 4 of them special needs  \n* 2 dogs die. We discuss ***on numerous occasions*** that 2-3 dogs is ideal headed forward\n\n---\n\n**~5 years ago**\n\nPartner is friends with a dog foster parent, who proceeds to (IMO) emotionally manipulate him over the next few years.\n\n* ~5 years ago: He gets 2 rescue puppies without telling me. That dog foster parent contacts him alone because she KNOWS he can't say no to dogs in need\n* ~3 years ago: The foster parent calls him up out of the blue and says they have a dog that needs a home. Another rescue dog behind my back = 6. \n* Last week: she calls him again: an abused dog with 3 legs. The dog had a tumor in one of his legs which was amputated a few weeks ago. The dog is adorable, fuck.\n\nMy partner adopts a 7TH DOG without consulting with me. He tells me that it will stay at his business (he owns a small retail shop) and that's at least better than it dying in a kennel. I'm angry but what can I do -- return the dog to the shelter and have it killed?\n\n---\n\n**ONE week goes by:**\n\n* He wants to bring the dog home overnight so that it isn't at the shop alone\n* Currently my partner has to stay there until ~midnight every night because --SURPRISE-- dogs need to go outside to pee and poop. \n\n---\n\n**Today:**\n\n* We discover that the dog *probably* still has cancer that has spread. \n* I still *kind of* don't want to bring the dog home because that means my partner \"wins\" and gets his way, exactly as he ALWAYS does.\n* He says that if anybody in my family needed a place to stay then he would never say no. I don't think that's a fair comparison; the point isn't the dog, it's the emotional manipulation and doing things without my input.\n* If I ***knew*** the dog was going to die soon then I would bring the damn thing home. But then if the dog *doesn't* have cancer then we just have yet ANOTHER dog in the house and he gets his way again -- the same as always.\n\n---\n\n**I should note:**\n\n* I LOVE dogs. I wish every dog could have a loving home, but there is a limit \n* 6 dogs = a part-time job. We can't both be away from the house for more than like 8 hours at a time. No weekend getaways, forget about vacations.\n* **This manipulative and inconsiderate behavior is making me seriously consider ending the 11-year relationship.** Admittedly, one thing preventing me is that I would miss those damn dogs, and I'm in no position to own a dog on my own.\n\n---\n\n**So I know HE is being a manipulative asshole here, but am I ALSO an asshole??** \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a partner adopting a seventh rescue dog without consulting the other person. The author is upset because they had previously discussed limiting the number of dogs to 2-3, but the partner kept getting more dogs, especially from a foster parent who manipulates him. Now, the seventh dog has cancer, and the author doesn't want to bring it home because they feel it's another win for the partner's manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's partner has a history of getting dogs behind their back, using emotional manipulation. They've had discussions about the ideal number of dogs, but the partner ignores these agreements. The author is struggling with the emotional and practical burden of more pets, which affects their quality of life. They're also considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing issue.\n\nThe partner's side is that he can't say no to dogs in need, especially when someone else is manipulating him. He sees himself as helping the dogs, even if it means overstepping the agreed-upon number. He brings up the example of housing family members, which might be a way to justify his actions, but the author sees it as an unfair comparison.\n\nThe author is concerned about their own well-being and the practical aspects of having too many dogs. They're not refusing help to a dog that's sick but are worried about the long-term implications of giving in to the partner's demands. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in their refusal. They're not being cruel to the dog; they want it to stay at the business. Also, the partner's actions are repetitive and disregarding their previous agreements, which is a pattern of behavior contributing to the author's stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the partner is the one who acted without consent, breaking the mutual agreement. The author is standing their ground, which is understandable given the history. The author's hesitation isn't about the dog's welfare but about the partner's manipulative behavior and the impact on their lives. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to maintain a boundary that was previously agreed upon.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a partner who isn't respecting their boundaries, and their response is a valid reaction to protect their own interests and the agreed-upon household rules. The partner's actions are the main issue here, not the author's refusal to comply with this latest adoption without discussion.\n"
