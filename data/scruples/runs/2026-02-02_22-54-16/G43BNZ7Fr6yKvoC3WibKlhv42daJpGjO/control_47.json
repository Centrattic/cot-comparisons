The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should help their brother who's now going through a divorce, similar to what the author experienced before. \n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship changed after the author's divorce. The brother didn't help the author back then, instead being dismissive and not supporting him, which clearly hurt the author. Then, the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author confronted her, the brother took her side, leading to no contact for two years.\n\nNow the brother is reaching out, apologizing, and says he's getting a divorce. The author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues, and the author is considering not responding. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel wronged before. The brother didn't support them during a tough time, then didn't believe them when they tried to warn him about his wife's affair. The brother's actions led to a broken relationship. Now, the brother is asking for help, but the author is hesitant because of the past. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother is sorry and admits he was wrong before. The situation is repeating with the same affair partner, which might add to the complexity. However, the author's wife is against helping due to the previous betrayal. \n\nThe key points are the brother's past behavior (not helping and taking his wife's side) versus the brother's current apology and need for support. The author's decision not to help might be seen as justified given the history of betrayal and lack of support. The brother's past actions, including being dismissive and not investigating the affair, contributed to the strained relationship. The author's current reluctance is a reaction to those wrongs. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not helping now, especially considering the brother's past. They might be protecting themselves from further hurt. The answer is B.\n"
