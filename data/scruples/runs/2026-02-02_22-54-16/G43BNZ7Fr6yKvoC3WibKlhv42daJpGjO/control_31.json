The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who's been through a tough divorce and had a falling out with their brother. The brother had previously not supported them during their divorce, which was a tough time, and then later took his wife's side when the brother's wife was cheating. Now, the brother is going through a divorce himself and is asking for help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help due to past events. The author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The key points here are the history between the brothers. The author had a close relationship with their brother, but it was damaged when the brother didn't support them during their divorce and instead took his wife's side. That wife was apparently spreading lies about the author, which might have contributed to the brother's decision. Then, the brother's wife cheated, and the brother initially didn't believe the author when they confronted him. The author even sent some angry texts when drunk, but the brother now says he's sorry and wants help.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to help now. The brother is asking for help after a two-year break in contact, and the author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is contemplating cutting him off.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've been wronged before. The brother didn't help when the author needed support, took the sister-in-law's side, and the sister-in-law had a vendetta. Now, the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's wife is reluctant to help because of past behavior. The author might feel justified in not helping again, especially given the previous betrayal and lack of support.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother has apologized and is now seeking help. There's a chance that he's genuine in his apology, and the author might be giving him the benefit of the doubt. However, the past actions\u2014especially not supporting during a crisis and taking the sister-in-law's side\u2014could make the author wary of helping again without some assurance.\n\nThe author's consideration to not help could be seen as self-preservation. They might be protecting themselves from being taken advantage of again. The brother had a history of not being there when needed, so the author isn't obligated to help. However, if the brother is genuinely remorseful and this is a new situation, there might be room for forgiveness.\n\nBut the key point is that the brother is now in a similar situation. The author might be questioning whether their brother would have done the same for them. The brother didn't help before, so it's understandable if the author is hesitant. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, family obligations are complex. While there's an expectation to help family, past actions can alter that. The brother's previous behavior\u2014especially not supporting during a divorce and taking a spouse's side\u2014could make the author's refusal understandable. The author isn't in the wrong if they choose not to help, given the history. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
