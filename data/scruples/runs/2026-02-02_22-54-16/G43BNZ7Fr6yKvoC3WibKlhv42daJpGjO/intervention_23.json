The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The author has a history with their brother where the brother previously didn't support them during a messy divorce and then cut off contact after the author confronted his wife about an affair. Now the brother is reaching out again, but the author's wife is against helping him due to past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the past actions. The brother initially didn't help the author when they needed support, which is a significant point. Then, when the author tried to inform him about his wife's infidelity, the brother took her side and cut off contact. This shows a pattern of the brother not being supportive when the author needed help. The author also had some angry texts when drunk, but they admit it's irrelevant. \n\nNow, the brother is sorry and going through a divorce himself. The author's wife is against helping him because of past behavior. The author is conflicted. The key here is whether the brother's past actions justify the author not helping now. The author might feel betrayed and not want to support someone who didn't support them in the past. Also, the brother's actions caused a rift, so the author's reluctance is understandable. \n\nThe question is about right and wrong. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after the brother's past behavior. They have a right to set boundaries. The brother's current request might not erase past hurts. The author's wife's stance adds to the situation, but the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them before without expectation of reciprocity. The brother's past actions justify the author's decision to not help now.\n"
