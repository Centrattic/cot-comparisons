The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 26, has a brother who is 29, and they were once close. The author had a bad marriage that ended messily, and during that time, the brother didn't help him. Instead, the brother's wife was spreading lies. The author's current wife supported them. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating but didn't believe the author when he told him. The brother cut off contact for two years. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and is asking for help, but the author's wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want confirmation.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The brother didn't support the author during their crisis, even turning against them based on his wife's lies. The author was left to deal with the fallout alone, which is significant. Now, when the brother needs help, the author is hesitant because of past betrayal. The brother's actions were hurtful and unsupportive. The author had to endure that and now is being asked to help despite the history. The author's wife is opposed, which adds another layer.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while family can have obligations, it's not a two-way street if there's been a pattern of harm. The brother's past behavior\u2014dismissing the author's needs, taking his wife's side in a lie, cutting off contact\u2014could justify the author's reluctance to help now. The author isn't obligated to forgive or forget, especially if the brother didn't take responsibility before. The author's own experience of being unsupported might make them wary of helping someone who didn't help them in a similar situation.\n\nAlso, the brother's wife's actions and the brother's failure to believe the author contributed to the estrangement. The author might feel justified in not helping given the history. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless, but that's not always realistic, especially after such betrayals. The author's current wife's opposition is another factor; it's important to consider the impact on their marriage if they choose to help against her wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help, given the brother's past actions and the lack of support when the author needed it. The decision to prioritize their own past experiences and current relationship with their wife is understandable.\n"
