The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author and his brother were very close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's first divorce. The brother didn't help then, instead, his wife spread lies against the author. Later, when the brother's wife cheated, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother has found out about the affair and is seeking help, but the author is considering not helping because of past issues.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior was pretty bad. He didn't support the author when they needed it the most, took his wife's side without verifying the truth, and then cut off all contact. The author had a valid reason to feel betrayed and hurt. Now, the brother wants support, but the author is justified in being cautious. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or help immediately. Plus, the brother's wife's affair wasn't just a one-time thing; it's ongoing, which shows the brother might not have been paying attention. The author's decision not to help is a response to years of hurt and betrayal. It's about protecting their own well-being now. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. So, the answer should be B.\n"
