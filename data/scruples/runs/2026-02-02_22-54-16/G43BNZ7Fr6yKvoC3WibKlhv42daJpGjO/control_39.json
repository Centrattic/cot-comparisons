The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's first divorce. The brother didn't help then, and actually supported his wife who was spreading lies against the author. Later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants support, but the author's current wife is against helping because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of the brother's actions. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it most, took the side of his wife who was cheating, and cut off the author. Now, the brother is asking for help, but the author feels wronged in the past. The author's wife also doesn't want to help because of the brother's past behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. From what I can see, the brother's past actions were pretty hurtful. The author has a right to feel betrayed and might not want to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it. The brother's wife's affair and the brother taking her side shows a lack of trust and support towards the author. The author isn't obligated to help just because the brother is going through a tough time, especially after the brother's previous behavior. The author's decision not to help isn't necessarily inconsiderate if there's a history of being unsupported and betrayed. The current wife's stance also supports the author's position. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
