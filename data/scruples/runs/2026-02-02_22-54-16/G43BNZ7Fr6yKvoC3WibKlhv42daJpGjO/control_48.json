The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but after the author's messy divorce, his brother didn't support him. Instead, the brother's wife spread lies, leading the brother to turn against the author. The author then had a new wife who supported him. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when the author told his brother, he was disbelieved and cut off. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for not helping. The key points here are the brother's previous behavior. The brother was unSupportive when the author needed help, took his wife's side, and cut off the author. The author's wife is also against helping because of the past. The brother only reached out after realizing his wife was cheating, same as before. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while family support is usually encouraged, the brother's past actions were harmful. The author has valid reasons to be cautious. The brother's wife's vendetta and the brother taking her side caused the rift. Now, the brother is seeking help after realizing his mistake. The author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them, especially considering the history of betrayal. The author's decision not to help isn't necessarily wrong because they've been hurt before and their current wife supports that choice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have justification based on past experiences and their spouse's support.\n"
