The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The author has a history with their brother where he previously sought help during his own messy divorce, but the brother didn't support him and even turned against him. The brother later had an affair, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is asking for help again, but the author's current wife is opposed due to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past behavior. The author was in a tough spot before and the brother was unsupportive, even letting his wife influence him negatively. Then, when the brother found out his wife was cheating, he dismissed the author's warnings and severed the relationship. Now, the brother is reaching out again, but the author is considering not helping because of the past betrayal and their wife's stance.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's previous actions\u2014being unsupportive during a crisis, taking the wife's side against the author, cutting off contact\u2014seem to justify the author's hesitation. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after such a history of betrayal. The wife's anger from the past is also a factor, though the author's own actions (texting the sister-in-law) were poor, but they admit it was when drunk and consider it irrelevant now.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's decision to not help is justified. Given the brother's past behavior and the lack of trust, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on past experiences. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
