The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship soured after the author's divorce when the brother didn't support him. The brother's wife was spreading lies, leading the brother to reject the author. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, and now he's seeking help. The author's wife doesn't want to help the brother due to past issues, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, key points: The brother previously failed the author during a tough time, taking sides against him. Now the brother is in a similar situation. The author is hurt and might not want to help, given the past betrayal. The brother's wife was unfaithful, and the brother didn't trust the author's warning. The author has their own family's feelings to consider, including their wife's strong opposition.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not helping. On one hand, family support is important. On the other, the brother's past behavior might justify the author's hesitation. The author's wife's stance also plays a role. The brother's own actions in not believing the author when he had valid concerns about the wife's infidelity might have contributed to the current situation. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and their wife's wishes, especially after being betrayed before. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them. So, answer B.\n"
