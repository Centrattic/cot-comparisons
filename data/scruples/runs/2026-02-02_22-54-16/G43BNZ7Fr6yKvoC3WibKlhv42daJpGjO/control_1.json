The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's now going through a divorce. The brother and author are the only family they have. \n\nFirst, I need to look at their history. The author got married at 19, the marriage failed, and during that time they asked the brother for help, but he didn't support them and was even hostile. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the author had a hard time, but eventually got through it with their current wife's support. After that, the relationship between the brothers wasn't as close.\n\nThen, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but didn't believe the author when they told him. The brother took his wife's side and cut off contact for two years. The author did some things like texting the sister-in-law harsh messages when drunk, but that's being dismissed as irrelevant. Now the brother is sorry, his wife is cheating again, and they're divorcing. The author's wife is against helping the brother due to past issues, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe key factors here are the brother's past behavior. He didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side over the author, and cut off contact. The author has been through a tough time without help before, and now the brother is asking for help. The author's wife supports not helping, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe author's actions: not helping the brother now. The brother's past actions were harmful and unsupportive. The author might feel justified in not helping because of the previous betrayal. The brother did apologize and is now in a similar situation, but past actions might make the author hesitant to trust him again. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The brother didn't support them when they needed help, and now the author is within their right to choose not to support him, especially after the past hurt. The author's wife's stance also plays a role. The brother's initial betrayal is significant. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
