The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong for them not to help their brother during his divorce, given their past.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother used to be very close. The brother didn't help the author during his messy divorce, even though the author was suicidal. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, which might explain the brother's behavior. Later, when the author found out about the brother's wife's affair, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now the brother is reaching out for help after his divorce, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help due to past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not responding. The user is asking if that makes them the AITA.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's past actions: not supporting the author when he needed help, taking his wife's side when she cheated, and cutting off contact. The author is now being asked for help, but given the history, the author might feel justified in not helping back.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone wrongs you in the past, you might not have an obligation to help them later. The brother's behavior was pretty hurtful, and the author might not want to enable or excuse that behavior. Plus, the author's wife is against helping, so there's also a factor of protecting their own marriage.\n\nHowever, family ties can complicate things. Some might argue that even if the brother was wrong before, supporting family during tough times is important. But in this case, the brother didn't support the author when he needed it, so the author might feel it's a fair response to not help now.\n\nI think the brother's actions in the past were inconsiderate and hurtful. The author isn't required to forgive or forget, especially if helping now would reopen old wounds or support someone who didn't support them when it mattered most. The author's decision not to help isn't necessarily wrong given the context. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
