The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his brother were close, but their relationship deteriorated. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother refused, influenced by his wife. Later, the brother discovered his wife was cheating but didn't believe the author when he warned him. Now, the brother is seeking help again after the divorce, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past grievances. The brother didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side when confronted about her affair, and cut off contact. Now the tables have turned. The author is hesitant to help because of the brother's past behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. From a moral standpoint, family support is important, but so is accountability for past actions. The brother's previous actions were hurtful\u2014disbelieving the author, taking his wife's side, and cutting off contact. The author's wife also has valid reasons to be upset given the brother's wife's past behavior towards them.\n\nHowever, the brother is now in a similar situation, having gone through a divorce. But he had the chance to support his brother earlier and didn't. The author might feel that the brother didn't reciprocate the support when needed. The author's decision to not help could be seen as a way to protect themselves from further hurt, especially after the brother's betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But considering the brother's past actions and the lack of support when the author needed it most, the author's reluctance is understandable. The brother's wife's role in spreading lies and the brother's refusal to believe the author add layers of complexity. The author might feel that helping now would be enabling the brother's poor decisions without accountability.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to prioritize their own well-being and the lessons learned from past experiences. The brother's lack of support and the sister-in-law's vendetta contribute to the author's current stance. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
