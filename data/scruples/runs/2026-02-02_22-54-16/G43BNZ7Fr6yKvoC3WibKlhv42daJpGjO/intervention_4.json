The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother had previously not supported the author during their messy divorce, and then took his wife's side when the author confronted her about an affair. Now the brother is reaching out again, but the author's wife is against helping him due to past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author had a close relationship with his brother but it was strained after the brother didn't support him in a tough time and then took his wife's side when she was cheating. The brother's wife was also a problem, spreading lies and causing issues. Now the brother is getting a divorce again, and the author is considering not helping him.\n\nThe key points here are the past grievances. The brother didn't help when the author needed support, took the wrong side in the affair situation, and the wife's actions were harmful. The author has valid reasons to feel hurt and might not want to provide support after being let down before. The brother's wife was involved in spreading lies, which complicates things further.\n\nThe author is now in a position where they're being asked for help again, but considering their history, it's understandable if they choose not to. The brother's actions in the past were hurtful, and the author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them, especially if there's no indication of change or accountability from the brother. The brother's wife's role in spreading lies might also be a factor the author isn't willing to overlook.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help. The past actions of the brother and his wife have created a rift that's hard to mend, and the author is justified in prioritizing their own well-being and their current wife's feelings. The answer should be B.\n"
