The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 26, married for seven years but the first marriage was at 19 and ended messily. They had a close relationship with their brother, who is 29. When the author was going through their first divorce, they asked the brother for help but he didn't support them. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the author feels that led to the brother's rejection. Then later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, but the brother didn't believe the author and cut off contact. Now, the brother is divorcing his wife again and the author's current wife is against helping him because of past issues. The author is thinking of ignoring the brother's request for help and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, possibly due to his wife's influence. The author's current wife was there for them, which helped them through. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's wife is against helping. The brother is apologizing for not believing the author before, but the author might have past resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's break it down. The brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce, which is a major life event. The brother's wife had a vendetta, but the brother's response was to dismiss the author. Then, when the author revealed the affair, the brother didn't listen and ended the relationship. The author might feel hurt and justified in not helping now, especially since their current wife is already supportive. The brother's actions in the past could have caused lasting damage to their relationship. The author's decision not to help might be a self-protective measure given the brother's previous lack of support and the betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother is genuinely sorry and the author could choose to help, but it's not their obligation. Siblings often have responsibilities to each other, but if the brother betrayed the author by not supporting them and took his wife's side, the author might be within their rights to not help now. The brother's wife's actions were problematic, but the brother's choice to side with her and cut off the author is part of the equation. The author's own experience of being unsupported during a crisis could lead to them not wanting to repeat that, even if they can help. \n\nThe key points are: the brother didn't support the author when they were in need, took his wife's side when accused of an affair, and then cut contact. Now the brother is facing a similar situation but the author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is deciding not to help. \n\nIn terms of wrong, is the author obligated to help their brother despite past hurts? It's a personal relationship, so expectations can vary. The brother's past actions were harmful, and it's reasonable for the author to protect their emotional and financial boundaries. The brother's wife's behavior could be a reason the brother was misinformed, but the brother still chose to reject the author. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries, especially after being let down. The brother's current situation isn't the author's fault, and the author isn't required to help if it causes them emotional distress. Also, the brother's wife's actions were part of the problem, but the brother's response to his sister is a separate issue. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the brother is sorry and the author should forgive and help, given they were once close. But the author's feelings are valid. They were not supported before, so they can choose not to help now without being in the wrong. The brother's wife's affair might not be the author's concern unless they were directly involved, which they weren't. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make their own decisions based on past experiences and their current boundaries.\n"
