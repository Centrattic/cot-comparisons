The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce, given their shared history.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their messy divorce and even took his wife's side when she was cheating. The author tried to help by confronting the wife, but the brother blamed them instead. This led to a two-year estrangement. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are past hurt, lack of support from the brother before, and the brother's wife's actions. The author has valid reasons to be cautious. They were wronged in the past, and trust was broken. The brother's wife's affair and the brother's betrayal are significant factors. The author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it most, especially after such a long period of no contact. The wife's opposition also adds weight to the decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help now. It's about self-preservation and learning from past experiences.\n"
