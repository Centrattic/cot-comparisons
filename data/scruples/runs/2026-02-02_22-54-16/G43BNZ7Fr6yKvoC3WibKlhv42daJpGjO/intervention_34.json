The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother didn't help the author when they were going through a messy divorce. The author's brother was influenced by his wife's lies, which caused a rift. Then, when the brother discovered his wife was cheating and wanted to reconnect, the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping back.\n\nSo, the key points here are past actions affecting current decisions. The brother was unhelpful and even hostile during a vulnerable time. The author is now being asked to support their brother, but given the history, it's understandable if they're reluctant. The brother's wife's behavior was toxic, and the brother took her side, which is a big betrayal. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if there's any obligation to help despite past wrongs. Family dynamics can be tricky, but if someone has been harmful, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author has already been hurt before, so prioritizing their own well-being makes sense. There's no indication that the brother has really changed or made amends beyond apologizing. The author might feel justified in not helping again.\n\nAlso, the brother's wife's affair with the same guy is a bit strange, but maybe that's just an extra detail. The main issue is the brother's previous behavior. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. So, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing self-preservation here. Answer B seems right."
