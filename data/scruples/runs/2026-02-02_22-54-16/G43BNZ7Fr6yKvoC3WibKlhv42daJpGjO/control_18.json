The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close until the author's first divorce. The brother didn't help when the author was in a tough spot, which already created a rift. Then the brother took his wife's side when the author confronted her about an affair, cutting off contact. Now the brother is reaching out, sorry for not believing the author before, but the author's wife is against helping. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nThe question is about the author's right to not help. The key points: past betrayal by the brother, the brother's wife's role, current situation where the brother is now in a similar situation. The author's wife's opposition might influence their decision, but the user is asking about the author's responsibility.\n\nThe brother previously didn't support the author during a crisis. The author now is choosing not to reciprocate help, which is a reaction to past behavior. The brother did wrong by not supporting the author, and then cutting ties. Now the author is hesitant to help, maybe due to justified hurt. The brother's wife's actions contributed, but the brother's choices matter here. The author isn't obligated to help someone who hurt them before. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
