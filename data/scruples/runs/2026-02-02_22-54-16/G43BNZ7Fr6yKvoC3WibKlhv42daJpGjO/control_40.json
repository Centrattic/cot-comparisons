The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is complicated with past events affecting the current dynamics.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't help the author during their messy divorce, which led to significant personal struggles. The author then found out the brother's wife was having an affair but the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is seeking help again after his wife's continued infidelity, but the author's wife is against it due to past grievances.\n\nThe key points here are the history of betrayal and the current lack of trust. The author had a strained relationship with their brother after being unsupported and disbelieved. The brother's wife's actions and the brother's alignment with her added to the rift. Now, the brother is asking for help, but given the past, the author is hesitant. \n\nConsidering the context, the author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them before. The brother's initial refusal to support the author and taking his wife's side in the affair is a major factor. The author's decision to not help might stem from justified hurt and the need to protect themselves from further betrayal. The current situation also involves the author's wife opposing the help, which adds another layer to their decision.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here because their stance is based on past experiences and the need to set boundaries. Their brother's actions have caused lasting damage to the relationship, making it reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being.\n"
