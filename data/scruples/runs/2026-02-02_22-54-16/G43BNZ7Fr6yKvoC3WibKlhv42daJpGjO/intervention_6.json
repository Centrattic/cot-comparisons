The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce, given the history between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his brother were close, but the brother didn't help the author during his own messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies, and the brother took her side. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating, and the brother still didn't believe him, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is seeking help again, but the author's wife is against it due to past events. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of betrayal and the lack of support from the brother when the author needed help. The brother took the side of his wife, even when the author was suffering. The author's wife is also against helping now because of the past. The author is hurt and might feel justified in not helping now.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is obligated to help despite the past. The brother's actions were harmful, and the author might have valid reasons to not want to help after being wronged. The author's feelings and the wife's support are part of the equation. The brother's change of heart now might not erase the previous hurt. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and not help, especially given the history. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
