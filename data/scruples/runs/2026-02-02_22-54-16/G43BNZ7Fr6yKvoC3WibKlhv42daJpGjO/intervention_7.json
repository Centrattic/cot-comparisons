The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior: when the author had a messy divorce at 19, their brother didn't support them and even told them to \"get fucked.\" Then later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the brother took her side and cut off contact. The author admitted to some harsh texts when drunk, but they're saying that's irrelevant now.\n\nNow the brother is coming back, saying he found out about the affair too and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering ignoring him. \n\nThe key points are the brother's previous lack of support and betrayal. The author was in a tough spot and didn't get help, which probably caused resentment. The brother's wife was also involved in spreading lies, which complicates things. The author's current stance is to not help, given the history. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The brother's actions back then were hurtful and unsupportive. The author has been through a similar situation and might be protecting themselves from being taken for granted again. Also, the brother's wife's behavior adds to the tension. \n\nThe author's wife is against helping, which might influence the decision. The brother is now asking for help, but there's a history of not being there for each other. The author is probably justified in not wanting to help, especially if they've already rebuilt their life and their wife is supportive. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have reasons to be cautious and prioritize their own well-being after past experiences.\n"
