The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's going through a divorce. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were close, but their relationship was damaged when the author was going through a messy divorce a few years back. The brother didn't support the author financially or emotionally, and the brother's wife was spreading lies about the author. The author managed to get through that tough time with the help of their current wife. Then later, the brother discovered his wife was having an affair, but he supported her over the author when confronted. This led to a complete breakdown in their relationship, with no contact for two years. The author even sent some angry texts to the brother's ex-wife when drunk, which they admit was a mistake.\n\nNow, the brother is going through a divorce again, and he's reaching out for help. The author's wife is against helping him due to past issues. The author is considering not responding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the brother's past actions. He didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side against the author, and they haven't spoken in years. The author is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it. However, the brother is now in a similar situation and is seeking support. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nBut the brother is now acknowledging the past mistake and is in a divorce again. The author might feel that the brother didn't support them when needed, so why should they support him now? The author's wife's stance could influence the author's decision. The author is in a position where they can choose to help or not. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's past behavior was hurtful, and the author has valid reasons for not wanting to help. The brother's current situation is similar to the author's past, but the author's experience of being unsupported might make them reluctant. The author isn't obligated to help family, especially after such a history. Their decision not to respond is a personal choice based on past experiences. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They've been burned before, and it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and not help someone who didn't support them in the past. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author's decision to move on isn't unjustified.\n"
