The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce, given their complicated history.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their messy divorce, which led to a broken relationship. The author then found out about the brother's wife's affair but was disbelieved and cut off. Now the brother is reaching out for help again after the divorce, but the author's current wife is against helping due to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are the history of betrayal and lack of support from the brother. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to help, especially considering their brother's past actions and the wife's opposition. The brother's previous behavior, like taking his wife's side and the author's attempts to support him being ignored, have caused significant strain. The author might feel justified in prioritizing their own well-being and healing from past hurts. \n\nAdditionally, the brother's delayed realization about the affair could be seen as a sign that he didn't take the situation seriously until it was too late, which might reduce sympathy. The author's decision to not respond could be a way to set boundaries after years of being let down. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to protect their emotional and possibly financial health, especially after the brother's past behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
