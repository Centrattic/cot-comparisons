The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, there's a history here. The author's brother didn't support them during their own messy divorce, which led to a breakdown in their relationship. The brother was influenced by his wife, who the author found out was having an affair. The author confronted the brother, but he took his wife's side, leading to two years of no contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce himself and wants help, but his wife is still against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not helping? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The brother previously didn't support the author when they needed it, contributing to a strained relationship. The author's current wife is also against helping, which adds pressure. The brother's wife was unfaithful and had a vendetta, which complicates things. The brother is now asking for help after having a history of not supporting his sibling. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family can expect support, there's also the aspect of past hurt. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the brother's previous actions and the wife's role in causing the rift. However, some might argue that despite past issues, family should support each other regardless. \n\nBut given that the brother's wife was the one causing issues and the brother took her side, the author's stance is more about protecting themselves and their current family. The brother's actions in the past contributed to the estrangement, so the author isn't necessarily at fault for not offering help now. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key factors are the brother's prior lack of support and the negative influence from his wife. The author's decision to prioritize their own well-being and current family's wishes is understandable. There's no clear indication that the author acted wrongly in this scenario.\n"
