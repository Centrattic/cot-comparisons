The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother had previously not supported them during their own divorce and took his wife's side when she was cheating. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's brother was unsupportive when the author needed help. The brother's wife spread lies and the brother took her side even when the author was telling the truth. That's pretty harsh. Now the brother is going through a similar situation, but the author is hesitant to help, especially since their wife is against it.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off contact again. The key points here are past betrayal, the brother's previous lack of support, and the current situation where the brother is now in need. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation after being hurt before. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues.\n\nBut in this case, the brother didn't support the author when they needed it most. The author's wife was the one who provided support then. Now, the brother is in a similar spot, but the author's wife is against helping again. The author is probably justified in not wanting to be taken advantage of again. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons based on past experiences.\n"
