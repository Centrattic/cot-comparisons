The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close. The author had a bad divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him, even going as far as being dismissive. The brother's wife spread lies, which might have influenced him. Then, the brother later had an affair, took her side when the author confronted him, and cut off contact. Now the brother is going through his own divorce and wants support, but the author's wife is against helping because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points are mutual past issues. The brother didn't help the author when he needed it, and then the brother was unfaithful and took his wife's side. The author is hurt and maybe wants to protect their marriage by not supporting the brother this time.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, people can have boundaries, especially after betrayal. The brother's actions in the past (not helping during divorce and taking an unfaithful wife's side) might justify the author's hesitation. Also, the brother's wife was unkind, so the author's wife might have a point. However, the brother is now in a similar situation. But considering the brother's past behavior, maybe the author isn't wrong to not help. The brother did similar things before. It's about trust and mutual support. The author might feel they can't rely on their brother again, so choosing not to help isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong given the brother's past actions and the current context.\n"
