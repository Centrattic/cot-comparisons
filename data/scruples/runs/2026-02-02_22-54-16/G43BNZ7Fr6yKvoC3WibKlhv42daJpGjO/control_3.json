The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their brother were close, but their relationship has been strained. The author had a failed marriage earlier, during which they asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support them, influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was having an affair, but the brother didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce from the same wife, and the author's current wife is against helping him, so the author is considering not helping.\n\nThe key points here are the past history of betrayal and lack of support from the brother. The author felt abandoned when they needed help, and the brother's actions (taking his wife's side, cutting off contact) contributed to the estrangement. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author is justified in being cautious, especially given the brother's past behavior and the wife's role in the previous issues.\n\nThe author's current wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author might feel that their brother isn't trustworthy or reliable, given the history. The brother's previous lack of support during a crisis could make the author hesitant to offer help now without some reconciliation or assurance. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them, especially if there's no indication of genuine remorse beyond the brother's recent apology.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. They have valid reasons based on past experiences. The brother's actions were harmful, and the author is prioritizing their own well-being and possibly their wife's feelings. The situation is complex, but the author's decision isn't unjustified. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
