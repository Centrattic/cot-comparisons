The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the full context. The author and their brother were close, but past issues caused a rift. The author had a failed marriage and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support him. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating but initially took her side. Now, the brother is seeking help again, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if that makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nLooking at the key points: The brother previously didn't support the author during a tough time, then took his wife's side when she was cheating. The author's wife is upset because of that past. The brother now wants help, but the author is hesitant due to past grievances.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong for not helping. Factors to consider: the brother's past behavior, the author's own history of needing support, the current situation, and whether there's a moral obligation to help family despite past issues. \n\nThe brother's actions were hurtful and he took the wrong side in the affair. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation after being wronged before. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author might feel justified in not helping given the brother's prior actions. On the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is a reasonable response to past harm. Since the brother was unsupportive and took the wife's side in the affair (which is a significant betrayal), the author's choice to not help might be seen as justified. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own interests after being hurt before. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
