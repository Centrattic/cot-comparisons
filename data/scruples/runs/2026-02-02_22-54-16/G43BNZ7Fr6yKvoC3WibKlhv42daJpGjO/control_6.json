The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce, given their complicated history.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother and the author were very close, but their relationship soured after a series of events. The author went through a messy divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him, influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the brother's wife cheated, and when the author tried to warn him, he took her side and cut off contact for two years. Now the brother is seeking help again, but the author's current wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for not helping now. The user wants a simple A or B answer. Let me consider the ethics here. Family support is often expected, but there's a history of betrayal and lack of support from the brother in the past. The author was let down when he needed help, and the brother was dismissive. Now, the brother is coming back, but the author's wife is concerned about past events, which might be valid. The author is considering not helping, which could be seen as self-protective, especially since there's a pattern of the brother not being reliable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, the brother's actions in the past (taking his wife's side, cutting off contact) and the fact that he was part of the problem through his wife's influence could justify the author's hesitation. The author has already suffered and might not want to repeat that experience. The brother's current situation is his own fault for not heeding the warnings earlier. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and not wanting to help someone who previously didn't support him. The answer should be B (No).\n"
