The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author are close, but their relationship has been strained. The author had a bad divorce at 19, and their brother didn't support them, even going as far as being hostile. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which might have influenced him. Then later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and is asking for help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nSo, the author is considering not helping their brother. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The key points here are the brother's past behavior\u2014being unsupportive during the author's tough time, siding with the unfaithful wife, and cutting off contact. The author's wife is also concerned about past events. \n\nThe brother did apologize for not believing the author before. But the author might feel justified in not wanting to help someone who previously didn't support them, especially after the betrayal. However, there's a history of the brother being a victim of his wife's lies. But in the end, the brother did take her side and caused a rift. \n\nThe author's decision to not help could be seen as a self-protective measure, especially if the brother's past actions were hurtful. On the other hand, the brother is now in a tough spot and is reaching out, so some might argue the author should support him regardless. But considering the brother's previous behavior, the author is not obligated to help. The brother's actions were pretty selfish before, so the author isn't in the wrong for not reciprocating support now. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
