The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. \n\nFirst, the brother's history with the author is complicated. The author had a bad divorce at 19 and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support him, possibly influenced by his wife. This led to a strained relationship. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair and the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and is asking for help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe key points here are mutual past support issues. The author felt wronged before when the brother didn't help, and now the brother is in a similar situation. The author is considering not helping, which could be seen as reciprocating the past behavior. However, the brother did apologize and acknowledged his mistake by taking the author's side about the affair. \n\nBut the author's wife is against helping, so there's a personal conflict here too. The author might be justified in not wanting to help given the brother's past actions, especially since the brother previously didn't support him. However, there's a chance that the brother has changed and is genuinely seeking help now. \n\nBut considering the history, the author's decision to not help might be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. The brother's wife spread lies before, and the brother took her side, which is a valid reason for the author to be cautious. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them, especially after such a betrayal. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because of the past mistreatment they endured.\n"
