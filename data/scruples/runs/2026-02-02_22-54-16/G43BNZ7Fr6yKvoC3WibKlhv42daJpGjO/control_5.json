The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should help their brother through a divorce, given their past.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but the brother didn't support the author when they went through a messy divorce years ago. The brother's wife was spreading lies, leading him to reject the author. The author then had support from their current wife and moved on, while their relationship with the brother cooled. Later, the brother discovered his wife was cheating, just like the author had warned him. Now the brother is seeking help, but the author's wife is against it because of past events.\n\nThe author is conflicted about helping. They might feel betrayed and hurt by the brother's past actions. The brother did cut them off after the author confronted his wife's affair, and the author did lash out drunk, calling the sister-in-law a name. But the brother is now asking for help, acknowledging he was wrong before.\n\nIs the author in the wrong if they don't help? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The brother wasn't supportive when needed, and the author has their own family to consider. The wife's opposition is a factor too. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after being let down before. The brother had a chance to support the author but didn't, so it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being and past experiences. They didn't make the brother's current situation worse, just aren't offering help. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong."
