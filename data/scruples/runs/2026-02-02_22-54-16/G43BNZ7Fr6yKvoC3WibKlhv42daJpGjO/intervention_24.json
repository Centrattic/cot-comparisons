The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The author and his brother were close, but there's a history of conflict. The author went through a difficult divorce and asked for help but was rejected by his brother. Later, he found out his brother's wife was cheating, confronted her, and the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now the brother is reaching out again after his own divorce, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's past actions. The brother didn't support his sibling during their divorce, didn't believe the author's warning about his wife's affair, and then cut ties. The author did something in the heat of the moment (texting a rude message when drunk), but that's acknowledged as irrelevant. The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, which is a key point. The brother's wife's lies and the brother taking her side without investigation might have been a big part of the conflict.\n\nNow, the brother is in trouble again. The author's wife is against helping, given the brother's past. The author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping now. \n\nFactors to consider: The brother's betrayal and lack of support when needed. The author's own history of being ignored and disbelieved. The brother's wife's role in the past. The current situation where the brother is also making a mistake by not investigating the affair earlier. The author's wife's stance against helping might influence the decision. \n\nThe author has every right to be cautious. After being wronged before, it's reasonable to not trust the brother's current plea for help, especially if there's no sign of genuine remorse or if the brother is repeating mistakes. The brother's wife's vendetta might still be an issue. The author's decision to not help might be a way to protect himself from further harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But in this case, the brother's actions were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to help someone who previously caused pain without taking responsibility. The brother's past behavior and the wife's lies complicate things. The author's own experience makes the situation more about self-preservation than selfishness. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in choosing not to help after the brother's betrayal and the ongoing issues with his wife. The brother's failure to believe him and the lack of support in the past gives the author reason to prioritize his own well-being now.\n"
