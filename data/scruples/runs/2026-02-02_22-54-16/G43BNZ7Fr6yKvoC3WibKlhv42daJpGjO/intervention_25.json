The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during a divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother didn't support the author during their messy divorce, even though they were close. The brother's wife spread lies, which might explain his lack of support. Then, when the brother found out his wife was cheating, he didn't believe the author when they confronted him. The brother took his wife's side and cut off contact. Now the brother is reaching out, sorry for not believing him, but the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe brother's past behavior was pretty hurtful. He didn't support the author when they needed help, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. That's a lot of betrayal. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author has reason to be cautious. The author's wife is against helping, which is a valid point. The author might feel that the brother didn't support them when it mattered, so why should they help now? Also, the brother's wife had an affair with the same guy, which raises questions about their judgment. \n\nBut some might argue that family should support each other regardless. However, in this case, the brother was actively harmful before. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially after being betrayed. The brother's actions in the past were not supportive, so the author isn't obligated to help him now. The fact that the brother is sorry now might be genuine, but past actions have consequences. The author's decision not to help is about self-preservation and learning from past experiences. \n\nI think the key factors here are the brother's lack of support during the author's crisis, the betrayal, and the current situation where the author is protecting their own interests. So the answer is B.\n"
