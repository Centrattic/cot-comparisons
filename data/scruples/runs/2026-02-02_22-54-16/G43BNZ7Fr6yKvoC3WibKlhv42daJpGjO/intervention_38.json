The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex. The brother and the author were close, but the brother didn't support the author during their own divorce, and instead, his wife was spreading lies. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side and cut off the author. Now, the brother is coming back for help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother previously didn't support the author when they needed it, took the wife's side when she was cheating, and the author now is considering not helping back. The brother's actions were harmful, and the author is being asked if they're wrong for not reciprocating support.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. To decide, I should consider if the author has a valid reason not to help. The brother's past behavior includes betrayal and not supporting the author when needed. The author's wife is against helping, which adds to the decision. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the brother's previous actions. There's also the part where the author sent some texts when drunk, but they admit it's irrelevant. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, family obligations can be subjective. The brother's betrayal might have broken trust, making it reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being and their wife's wishes. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the history of the brother not being supportive and the current wife's stance, the author's decision seems justified. The brother also had a chance to reconcile but cut off the author, which might have contributed to the current situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
