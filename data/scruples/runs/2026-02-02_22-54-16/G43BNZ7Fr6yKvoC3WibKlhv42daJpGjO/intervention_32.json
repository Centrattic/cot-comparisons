The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complicated with a history of past issues.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce, which was really tough. The author went through a messy divorce and felt abandoned by his brother. Then later, when the author tried to warn the brother about his wife's affair, the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now the brother is seeking help again after finding out the same wife was cheating, but the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not responding.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of betrayal and the current situation. The brother's past actions of not supporting the author and then cutting off contact might justify the author being hesitant. Also, the brother's wife was deceitful, which complicates things. The author's current wife's stance is another factor. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's past behavior could make the author's decision reasonable. People might feel they don't owe help to someone who didn't support them in a crisis. Plus, the brother's wife's actions were part of the problem. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, given the brother's previous betrayal and the lack of trust, the author might not be in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to help after being wronged multiple times. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
