The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were close. The author had a bad marriage that ended messily, and the brother didn't support them, even going as far as telling them to \"get fucked.\" The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the author got through it with their current wife's help. Then, the brother's wife was cheating, but he didn't believe the author when they told him. The brother then cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again, and the author's wife doesn't want to help him after everything. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past actions and current decisions. The brother wronged the author before by not supporting them and cutting ties. Now, the author is deciding not to help despite the brother's current situation. The author's wife is against helping, which might influence the decision. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider if the author has a moral obligation to help despite past betrayals. The brother's past actions were hurtful. The author might feel justified in not helping, especially since their wife supports that decision. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But in this case, the brother was actively harmful before. \n\nAlso, the brother is now in a similar situation, but the author's experience was worse. The brother dismissed the author's help when they needed it. Now that roles are kind of reversed, the author might feel it's a form of payback or that they don't owe him support. \n\nAnother angle: the author's decision is also influenced by their current wife's stance. But the author is the one making the choice here. The brother's actions in the past were pretty bad, so the author not reciprocating isn't necessarily wrong. The author has the right to protect themselves after being hurt before. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a history of betrayal from the brother, and it's their choice to prioritize their own well-being and their wife's feelings. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author isn't obligated to help now.\n"
