The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author have a complicated history. The author had a failed marriage early on and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which might explain his negative reaction. Later, the brother discovered his wife was cheating, but when the author warned him, he didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the brother previously didn't support the author during a tough time, took his wife's side, and rejected him. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayal. On the other hand, the brother is now in a similar situation and has apologized for not believing him before. The author might feel a duty to help despite the past, especially since they were once close.\n\nThe key points here are past actions and current circumstances. The brother's previous behavior was hurtful, and the author has valid reasons for being hesitant. The brother's apology might not fully repair the trust. The author isn't obligated to help, especially considering their wife's stance and the history. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help given the context.\n"
