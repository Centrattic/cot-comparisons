The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the author's brother previously didn't help him during his own messy divorce. The brother was supportive in name but actually told the author off, influenced by his wife's lies. This caused a rift between them. Then, when the brother found out his wife was cheating, he took her side and cut off the author. The author even admits to sending some angry texts when drunk, but claims they're irrelevant. Now the brother is going through a divorce again, and the author is considering not helping him because their sister-in-law is against it.\n\nThe key points here are the history of the brother's actions. The brother didn't support the author during his time of need, took the side of his cheating wife, and cut off the author. The author is now facing a choice to reciprocate that lack of support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping, given past actions.\n\nThe brother's past behavior was harmful and dismissive. The author's decision to not help might be seen as a response to the brother's past actions. However, family dynamics can be complex. But since the brother didn't support the author when he needed it most, the author might feel justified in not helping now. The sister-in-law's opposition is another factor, but the author is considering their own feelings and past experiences.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether you believe the author has a responsibility to help despite the brother's past actions. Given the brother's history, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and not wanting to be taken advantage of again. So the answer is B.\n"
