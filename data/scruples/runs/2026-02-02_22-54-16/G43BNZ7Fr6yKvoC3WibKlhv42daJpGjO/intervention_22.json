The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for choosing not to help their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the author's brother previously didn't support him during his own messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies, leading the brother to cut off the author. The author then had to rely on his new wife for support. Now, the brother is coming back for help after finding out his wife was cheating, which the author had warned him about years ago. The author's wife is against helping, and he's considering not responding.\n\nThe key points here are past actions and the current situation. The brother's betrayal was significant, especially during a vulnerable time for the author. The author might feel hurt and justified in not wanting to help now. The brother's wife's affair with the same guy the author had warned about adds to the irony and the brother's failure to take his warnings seriously.\n\nThe author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation after being wronged. The brother's past behavior\u2014taking his wife's side and cutting off the author\u2014might make the author hesitant to trust him again. The author's wife's stance against helping is also a factor, so the author might be respecting her feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But considering the emotional and financial toll the brother caused before, the author's hesitation makes sense. There's also the fact that the brother was in the wrong for not believing the author and taking his wife's side, which complicates the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. They have valid reasons rooted in past experiences. The answer is B.\n"
