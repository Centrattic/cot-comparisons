The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether not helping their brother during his divorce is the right choice.\n\nFirst, the brother and author are the only family they have. The brother is going through a divorce now, just like the author did seven years ago. Back then, the author needed help, and the brother didn't support them, even taking the brother's wife's side, which was problematic. Now, the roles have kind of reversed because the author's wife was unfaithful, and the brother is sorry for not believing the author before. \n\nThe author is considering not helping their brother this time around, and the question is if they're in the wrong. The key points here are past actions and current decisions. The brother previously didn't support the author and was influenced by his wife's lies. The author now is in a position where their wife is against helping him, possibly because of the past betrayal. \n\nThe author's potential inaction is a response to the brother's previous lack of support. The brother is now seeking help, but the author is hurt from the past. The author's wife is also involved, and her opposition might be due to the brother's prior behavior. \n\nSo, the author's decision to not help could be seen as self-defense or a consequence of the brother's past actions. The brother, in this case, is now in need, but the author is protecting their own family's interests and their own emotional well-being. \n\nThe brother did take his wife's side before, which is a red flag. The author might feel justified in not helping again, especially if the brother's wife's lies were part of the problem. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author's brother is now realizing his mistakes and asking for help, but the author is considering cutting him off. \n\nI think it's important to consider if the author's decision to not help is a proportional response. The brother was unhelpful and took the wrong side before, leading to a two-year estrangement. The author is now in a position where their wife is against helping, and the author is trying to move on. \n\nThe author's actions are a form of accountability for past behavior. The brother's wife had an affair and lied, and the brother didn't believe his sibling. The author might feel that the brother is now facing the same pain and is asking for help without taking responsibility for his previous role in the author's suffering. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not helping? It depends on whether the brother's current need is genuine and if the author has the capacity to help without being re-victimized. The author's wife is \"violently opposed,\" which suggests there's emotional trauma involved. \n\nIn some ways, the author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them before, especially if it's harmful now. The brother's own choices (like not investigating the affair earlier and taking his wife's side) contributed to his current situation. The author might be protecting their family from the same cycle of betrayal. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for not helping given the brother's past actions and the potential for further harm if they do choose to support him now.\n"
