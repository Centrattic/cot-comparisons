The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. \n\nFirst, the brother and the author have a history. The brother didn't support the author during their own messy divorce, which was a tough time. The brother's wife spread lies against the author, and the brother took her side. This caused a rift, leading to no contact for two years. The author even admits to some inappropriate texts when drunk, but they consider that irrelevant now.\n\nNow, the brother has come forward, admitting his wife was cheating and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past events. The author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nLooking at the brother's past behavior: he didn't support his sibling in a crisis, took the side of his wife who was clearly deceitful, and caused a significant breakdown in their relationship. The author has valid reasons to be cautious now. The brother's actions were hurtful and disloyal. \n\nThe author's current decision to not help could be seen as a self-protective measure, especially given the history. The brother's previous actions might make the author reluctant to trust him again. Also, the brother's wife's infidelity and manipulation might have played a role in his earlier decisions, but that doesn't excuse his betrayal. \n\nThe author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author might be in a position where helping could reopen old wounds or be seen as condoning past behavior. The brother's apology and request for help come after a long period of no contact, which might make the author question the sincerity or timing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a history of being wronged, and it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and the trust they've lost. The brother's past actions justify the author's hesitation to help without some form of reconciliation or proof of change. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
