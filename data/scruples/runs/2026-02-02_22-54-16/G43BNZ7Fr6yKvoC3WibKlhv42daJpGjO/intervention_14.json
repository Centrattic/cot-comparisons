The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's look at the context.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their messy divorce, which led to a falling out. The brother's wife was spreading lies, making the brother hostile. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when the author confronted them, the brother took her side and cut off contact. The author even admitted to some regrettable drunk texts but says they've had no contact for two years.\n\nNow, the brother is going through a divorce again, and he's asking for help. The author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues, and the author is considering not responding. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider if there's an obligation to help a sibling in need, especially after past conflicts. The brother had a history of not supporting the author and cutting ties. The author might feel justified in not helping now due to the brother's previous behavior. On the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues.\n\nBut given the brother's past actions\u2014abandoning the author when they needed help, taking his wife's side, and then cutting off contact\u2014it seems the brother also contributed to the rift. The author's decision to not help now could be seen as a choice to protect themselves and their wife from past hurt. The brother's wife's actions also played a role in the conflict. The author isn't obligated to forgive and forget, especially if it's causing personal distress. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
