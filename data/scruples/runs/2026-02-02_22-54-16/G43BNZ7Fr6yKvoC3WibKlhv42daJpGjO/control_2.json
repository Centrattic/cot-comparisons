The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother didn't help the author when they went through a messy divorce, which led to the author considering suicide. Then the brother's wife had an affair, and he took her side when the author tried to warn him. The brother cut off contact after that. Now the brother is coming back, sorry, and the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is thinking of not responding.\n\nSo, the key points here are past betrayals and lack of support from the brother. The author has been wronged before, and the brother didn't support them when they needed it most. The brother's wife was unfaithful, and he didn't believe the author. Now, the brother is seeking help, but the author is justified in being cautious given the history. The author's wife's opposition also adds to the tension. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping now. Since the brother didn't support them in their time of need, and then took the sister-in-law's side against the author, it's reasonable for the author to be wary. Trust was broken, and the brother's actions were hurtful. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them, especially after such significant betrayals. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
