The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the history between the siblings. The brother and sister (the author) were really close when they were younger. The author went through a messy divorce at a young age and sought help from her brother, but he didn't support her. Instead, he was influenced by his wife's lies, which caused a rift. Then later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but the author tried to warn him, and he didn't believe her, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The question is whether that makes her the \"asshole.\" \n\nSo, factors to consider: past betrayal, the brother's previous behavior, the current wife's opposition. The author was wronged in the past by both the brother and his wife. The brother didn't support her when she needed it, and even took his wife's side when the author tried to help. Now the brother is asking for help, but given the history, the author might feel justified in not wanting to support someone who didn't support her. \n\nAlso, the brother's wife had an affair with the same guy, which the brother didn't notice for a while. The author might feel that the brother was negligent in his own relationship. The author's current wife is against helping, which is a valid point because it affects their marriage. The author is in a stable marriage now, and the brother's past actions could hurt that. \n\nOn the other hand, siblings often have a duty to support each other, even after conflicts. But the brother's actions were pretty hurtful. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. The brother's initial betrayal and not believing her might make the author's reluctance understandable. \n\nThe author also admitted to texting the brother's wife when drunk, but it's labeled as irrelevant. Still, it's a minor point compared to the brother's actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She was wronged before, her current wife is against helping, and the brother had his chance to support her when she needed it and didn't. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
