The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during a divorce. The brother and the author are the only family they have, so their relationship is significant.\n\nFirst, the brother went through a divorce when the author was 19 and had a messy situation. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, instead being dismissive. The author's now-wife helped them through it, which probably healed some of the emotional wounds. Then, the author later found out the brother's wife had an affair and confronted her. The brother took her side, accused the author of trying to cause trouble, and cut off contact for two years. The author admits to some angry texts when drunk, but those might be less relevant now.\n\nNow, the brother is coming back, saying he found out about the affair too, is sorry for not supporting the author before, and is getting a divorce. The author's wife is against helping him due to past issues, and the author is thinking of cutting off contact again.\n\nThe key points here are the past betrayal and the current situation. The brother didn't support the author in their time of need, then dismissed the author's warnings about his wife's infidelity. The author's anger and the texts (though made in haste) might have contributed to the rift, but the brother's actions were majorly hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping now. The brother is now in a similar situation, but the author has a right to consider their own boundaries. The previous support from the author's wife was crucial, and the brother's wife's lies and the brother's betrayal can't be easily forgiven. The author might feel they can't trust the brother anymore, and the wife's opposition adds another layer. \n\nIn relationships, especially family, trust is important. If the brother broke that trust, the author isn't obligated to help. The brother should have considered the impact of his past actions. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
