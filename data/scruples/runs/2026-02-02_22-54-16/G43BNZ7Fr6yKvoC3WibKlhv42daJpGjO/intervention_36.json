The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it. \n\nThe author is 26, and their brother is 29. They were close, but their relationship has been damaged over the years. The author went through a messy divorce at a young age and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support them and was unkind. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair and confronted her, but the brother took her side, accused the author of causing problems, and cut off contact. The author admits to some harsh texts when drunk but says that's irrelevant. Now, the brother has discovered the affair and wants to reconnect, but the author's current wife is against helping him because of past actions. The author is considering not responding and moving on, and they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong if they don't help their brother now? The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The brother has a history of not supporting the author during their time of need. The brother's wife was actively working against the author, and the brother took her side even after being confronted with infidelity. The author was left to deal with their own divorce issues without support, which was difficult and led to considering suicide. Then, when the brother later found out the truth about his wife's affair, he reached out, but the author is hesitant to help because of past pain and betrayal.\n\nThe author's current wife is against helping him, which adds another layer. The author is now in a stable marriage, and their past wife's issues are resolved with support from their current spouse. The brother's past actions caused significant harm, and the author might feel justified in not wanting to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it most.\n\nOn the other hand, family relationships can be complex. There's the aspect of being the only family they have, which might suggest a responsibility to reconcile. However, the brother's actions were harmful and dismissive. The author has been through a lot, and it's understandable that they might not want to open old wounds again.\n\nThe brother's request to reconnect now that he's going through a divorce could be genuine, but the author might feel that the brother only wants help now when he's the one in need. The brother's wife's affair with the same guy he was previously told about raises questions about his own judgment or perhaps his wife's manipulative behavior. The brother's past behavior of not believing the author and taking his wife's side might have contributed to the current situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author has been a victim of the brother's actions and the sister-in-law's lies. They were not in the wrong when they asked for help and were met with hostility. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as self-preservation. Now, considering the history, the author might feel that the brother isn't genuine in his apology or that the brother is only reaching out for his help now that he's in trouble. \n\nThe author's current wife's opposition to helping is a valid consideration, as the author has a supportive relationship now and might not want to risk bringing past negativity into their current life. The author is within their rights to prioritize their well-being and that of their spouse. \n\nI think the key points here are the brother's past actions, the lack of support during a crisis, and the betrayal by someone supposed to be a close family member. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them in the past. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to respond and move on. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a painful history.\n"
