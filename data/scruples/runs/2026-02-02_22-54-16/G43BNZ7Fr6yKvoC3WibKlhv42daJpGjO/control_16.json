The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The story is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother had a messy divorce a while back. The author asked for help, but the brother didn't support him. Now the brother is going through another divorce because his wife was cheating, which the author had warned him about. The brother is asking for help now, but the author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: past betrayal where the brother didn't help the author during a tough time, then the author tried to help but was ignored, and now the tables are turned. The brother is now in a similar situation. The author is hesitant to help again, especially after the brother took his wife's side and cut off contact. Also, there's the issue of the author's wife not wanting to help because of the brother's past behavior.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, people might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, there's also the aspect of trust and reciprocity. The brother didn't support the author when needed, so the author might feel justified in not helping now. Additionally, the brother's wife was unkind, which added to the tension. The author's wife's objections are valid too, as they might have resources or emotional capacity to consider.\n\nBut another angle is that the brother is now in a similar crisis and is acknowledging his past mistakes. The author might be giving him another chance or not. However, the author has already experienced the pain of being let down and might be protecting themselves from further harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have reasons to prioritize their own needs and their wife's feelings. Helping family can be important, but it's not a legal or moral obligation. The author's decision to move on isn't about being right or wrong, but about self-preservation and past experiences. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
