The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were once very close, the only family they had. The brother previously didn't support the author during his own messy divorce, instead being influenced by his wife's lies. The author's current wife helped him through that time. Then, when the brother discovered his wife was cheating, he blamed the author and cut off contact. The brother's wife had an affair with the same guy, which the brother didn't realize until now. Now, the brother is seeking help again, but the author's wife doesn't want to support him due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are past betrayal, lack of support from the brother before, the brother's wife's deceit, and the author's possible justification for not helping now. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong by not assisting.\n\nI need to weigh the brother's previous actions against the current situation. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. The author might feel justified in not helping back, especially given the history. On the other hand, family obligations and past closeness might argue for helping regardless. But since the brother wronged the author first, and the author's wife is against it, the author's decision not to help might be seen as self-preservation. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has been harmful and untrustworthy. So, likely the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
