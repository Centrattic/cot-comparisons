The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close. The author went through a tough divorce at 19, asked for help, but the brother didn't support him and was influenced by his wife's lies. The author then married his current wife who supported him. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but he took her side when the author told him. This led to a two-year no-contact period. Now, the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past betrayals and lack of support from the brother. The author felt abandoned when he needed help, and the brother didn't believe him about the affair. Now, the brother is asking for help after realizing his mistakes. The author is conflicted but considering not helping because of the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, people often expect support from family, but if there's a history of betrayal and the brother was unsupportive, it's understandable for the author to be hesitant. The brother's wife spread lies before, and the brother took her side. The author's decision to not help might be a way to protect himself from further hurt. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the circumstances, the author isn't obligated to help, especially if it's at the expense of his own well-being. The brother's actions in the past were hurtful, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not reciprocating now. So the answer is B.\n"
