The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (the person writing the WIBTA post) is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother and the author used to be really close. The author had a messy divorce a while back and asked for help from his brother, but the brother refused. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, which probably influenced the brother's decision. The author managed to recover with their current wife's support. Then later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but he didn't believe the author when they confronted him, leading to a 2-year fallout. Now the brother wants help again, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of conflict. The brother didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side, and cut off the author. Now the roles are kind of reversed\u2014author is being asked for support, but the author's wife is hesitant. The author is conflicted.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother did wrong in the past by not supporting the author and cutting ties. Now the brother is in a similar situation. The author's wife is against helping because of past grievances, which is understandable. The author is considering not helping, which might be justified given the brother's past behavior. However, there's also the fact that the brother has now come forward with his own issues, and maybe there's growth on his part by apologizing.\n\nBut the author isn't being asked to help in a malicious way. The brother's wife's actions were part of the problem. The author's anger and past actions (texting the sister-in-law) might not matter as much if the brother is now taking responsibility. However, the author's wife's support in the past was crucial. The author's current stance could be seen as self-preservation, especially after being wronged before.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not helping. They have valid reasons based on past experiences. The brother's actions previously were harmful, and the author is protecting their own well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
