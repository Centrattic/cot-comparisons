The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. From the story, the brother has a history of not supporting the author when they were going through a divorce. The author's brother took his wife's side when the author was trying to help, which caused a rift. Now the brother is reaching out for support, but the author's wife is against it, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother was unhelpful when the author needed support, and even contributed to the problem by his wife's lies. The brother then cut off contact for two years. Now, when the brother is in a similar situation, the author is being asked if they should help despite the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing not to help. The key points are: past betrayal by the brother, the brother's wife's actions, the brother's lack of support, and the recent reconciliation. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nIn many cases, people might expect family to support each other regardless of past issues. However, the brother's actions were harmful during the author's time of need. The author might feel that the brother didn't support them when it mattered, so they don't owe him support now. Also, the brother's wife's affair and the brother taking her side shows a pattern of poor judgment.\n\nThe author's decision not to help might be seen as justified if they believe the brother didn't have their back before. On the other hand, some might argue that family support is important regardless of past issues. But given the brother's history of betrayal and the author's valid reasons for not trusting him, the author's choice could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
