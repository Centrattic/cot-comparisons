The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex. The brother had a past where he didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side when she was cheating, and then cut off contact. Now the brother is coming back for help, but the author's wife is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's past actions. He didn't help when the author needed support, which was a tough time. The author went through a messy divorce and even considered suicide, but the brother was unsupportive. Then, when the author confronted the brother's wife about her affair, he took her side and cut off the author. That's pretty hurtful and shows a lack of support when it was needed most.\n\nNow, the brother is asking for help again. The author is considering not responding. The key here is whether the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct.\n\nThe brother's wife was part of the problem too, spreading lies and having an affair. The author's wife is now against helping him, which adds another layer. The author might feel justified in not helping because of the previous betrayal. People often expect support from family, but when that support isn't given in return, it's understandable to be hesitant.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's actions were definitely hurtful. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them. Especially if the brother didn't take responsibility before. Now, even though he's sorry, the author might need time to trust again. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help. The answer should be B.\n"
