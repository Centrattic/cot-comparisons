The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his brother were close, but their relationship has been damaged over the years. The author had a failed marriage early on and sought help from his brother, but the brother didn't support him. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author confronted them, the brother took her side. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo the key points are: past betrayal, the brother's previous lack of support, the sister-in-law's role in spreading lies, and the current wife's opposition. The author is deciding whether to help now.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether that's correct. The brother didn't support the author during his tough time, and then took the side of the sister-in-law against the author. Now the brother is in a similar situation. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the past behavior. However, sometimes family support is expected regardless of past issues.\n\nBut in this case, the brother's actions were pretty hurtful. The author was in a crisis, and the brother didn't help, even being actively hostile. Then, when the author tried to help by exposing the affair, the brother turned on him. That's significant. The author's current wife is also against helping, which adds another layer. The author might be acting out of self-preservation and justified anger.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could still offer some support despite the past. But given the brother's behavior, it's understandable if the author doesn't want to help. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother wasn't supportive before and took the sister-in-law's side, the author's decision to not help now might be reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
