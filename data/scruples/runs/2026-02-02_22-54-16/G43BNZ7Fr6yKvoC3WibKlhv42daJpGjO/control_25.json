The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were very close. The brother previously didn't support the author during his own divorce, which was really tough. The brother's wife was spreading lies, leading the brother to cut off the author. Then, when the brother's wife cheated, the brother took her side and ended the relationship with the author. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and the brother's wife is against helping him, so the author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the past actions. The brother didn't support the author when he needed it, even after the author's wife helped him through the divorce. The brother took his wife's side over his sibling. Now, the brother is in a similar situation but the author is hesitant to help because of past grievances.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother had a chance to support the author when it mattered, but he didn't. He even cut off the author when the author was trying to help with the affair. So, the author might feel justified in not helping now. But some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, the brother's actions were pretty hurtful. The author is also considering not helping because of the previous betrayal and the wife's stance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The brother didn't reciprocate the support when needed. People can have their opinions about family support, but if someone doesn't support you when you're vulnerable, it's reasonable to not help them later. The author's decision is understandable given the history. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
