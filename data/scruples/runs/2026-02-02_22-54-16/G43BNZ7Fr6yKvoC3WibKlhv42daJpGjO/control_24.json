The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but the brother didn't help the author when they went through a messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies about the author, and the brother took her side. Then, after some time, the author found out that the brother's wife was having an affair and confronted her, but the brother still supported his wife, leading to a two-year estrangement. Now the brother is finally divorcing his wife, but the author's wife is against helping him due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the past betrayal by the brother, the author's current wife's disapproval, and the brother's recent apology. The author is torn between helping their brother despite his past behavior or cutting off contact. \n\nThe user wants a simple answer: A if the author is in the wrong, B if not. Let me break it down. The brother's past actions were pretty bad\u2014betraying his sibling, taking his wife's side during the affair, and allowing his wife to spread lies. The author had to go through a tough time without support and then was cut off. Now, the brother is apologizing and seeking help, but the author's wife is against it. The author is considering not helping. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not helping? Well, family dynamics can be complicated. The brother's previous behavior was harmful, and the author was wronged. The author might have justified not wanting to help due to the brother's past actions. However, the brother is now apologizing. The author might feel conflicted. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing self-preservation. The brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother didn't support his sibling during a crisis. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author might be protecting their own interests and past experiences. \n\nIn situations where someone has been wronged before, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author is allowed to prioritize their own well-being. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide not to help given the history. The brother's recent apology might not immediately erase past hurt, especially if the author's wife is against it. The author can choose to not help without being AITA.\n"
