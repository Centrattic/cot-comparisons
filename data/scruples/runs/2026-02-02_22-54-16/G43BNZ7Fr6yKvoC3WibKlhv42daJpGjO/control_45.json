The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother and author were close, but there's a history of conflict. The author had a bad divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them. Then the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author confronted them, the brother took his wife's side. This led to a 2-year no-contact period. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: past support when the author needed help was lacking, the brother took his wife's side over the author, and there's recent conflict. The brother is now asking for help, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The question is about moral responsibility here. The author's brother didn't support them in a time of need, and then took his wife's side in an affair, which caused a rift. Now the brother is in a similar situation. The author is considering not helping, given the past.\n\nIs there an obligation to help family, even after they've wronged you? The brother's past actions were hurtful. The author might feel justified in not helping, especially since their current wife is against it. However, family can be complicated. But the brother is now in a vulnerable position. However, the brother's past behavior was not supportive, and the author might not want to enable the same pattern.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the brother didn't support them when they needed it, and took his wife's side. The author has every right to prioritize their own well-being and not help someone who didn't help them. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author can choose to move on without helping.\n"
