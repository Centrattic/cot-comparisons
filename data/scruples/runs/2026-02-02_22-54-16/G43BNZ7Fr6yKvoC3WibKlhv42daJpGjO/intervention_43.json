The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were really close, but the brother previously didn't support the author during their own messy divorce. The author's then-wife supported them instead, which probably hurt the brother's relationship with the author. Then, the brother found out his wife was cheating, took her side, accused the author of trying to break up his marriage, and cut contact. Now the brother is coming back, saying he found out the affair and is sorry for not believing the author before, and the author is considering not helping again. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nI need to evaluate the dynamics here. The brother's past behavior was pretty bad\u2014he didn't help when the author needed it, and when the author confronted his wife's infidelity, he didn't support the author but instead blamed them and cut ties. The author is now being asked to support the brother again, but given the history, it's understandable if they're hesitant. The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, which strained their relationship before. The author's current wife is against helping, which adds another layer.\n\nThe key points are the brother's prior lack of support and betrayal. The author might feel justified in not helping now as a way to protect themselves from further hurt. People often set boundaries after being hurt, especially if they've had to deal with someone else's lies or betrayal. The brother's actions were harmful, so the author not wanting to help again isn't necessarily wrong. It's about respecting their own emotional well-being and past experiences. The brother's remorse might be genuine, but rebuilding trust takes time. The author isn't obligated to help just because they're family. So the answer is B.\n"
