The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close. The author went through a bad divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him and even let his wife spread lies. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when he told the brother, he didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a similar situation, and the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past support (or lack thereof) from the brother, the brother's betrayal by taking his wife's side, and the author's possible resentment. The author's wife is also against helping due to past events. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's consider the dynamics. The brother didn't support the author during a tough time and even contributed to the author's distress by allowing his wife's lies. Then, the brother dismissed the author's warning about his wife's infidelity, leading to more pain. Now, the brother is facing similar issues. \n\nThe author has reasons to not want to help, given the past betrayal. It's about reciprocity and trust. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author's reluctance is understandable. But does that make the author in the wrong? Well, family ties can be complex. Even if the brother was at fault before, the author might feel entitled to reciprocate the lack of support. However, some might argue that cutting off completely could be too harsh, but the author is considering not responding, not necessarily cutting off. \n\nThe author's wife's violent opposition adds another layer. The author is in a tough spot, balancing past hurts with possible future family relations. The brother's recent actions (apologizing and getting a divorce) might be a step towards reconciliation, but the author's trust is broken. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether the author's decision is justified. The brother's past behavior justifies the author's hesitation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and past experiences. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help, given the history.\n"
