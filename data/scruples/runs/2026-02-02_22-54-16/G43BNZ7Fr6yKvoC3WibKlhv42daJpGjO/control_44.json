The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but there's been a lot of history. The author had a bad divorce when they were 19, and they asked their brother for help, but he didn't support them. Instead, the brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, which probably made the brother turn against the author. That led to a major rift. Then, later, the author found out about the brother's wife cheating and confronted her, but the brother took her side and cut off contact. The brother stayed with his wife even when she was having an affair. Now, the brother is finally divorcing her, but the author's wife is against helping him because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The key points here are the brother's past behavior. He didn't support the author when they needed help, took his wife's side against the author, and cut off contact. The author's wife is against helping because of that history. The brother is now asking for support after being unsupportive before. \n\nThe author's decision to not help could be seen as justified because of the brother's past actions. The brother didn't support them when they were in a crisis, and the author might feel that the brother didn't deserve help after treating them so poorly. The brother also took the side of the unfaithful wife, which shows poor judgment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But in this case, the brother's actions were harmful and he contributed to the conflict by not listening to his brother. The author has already been hurt before and might not want to go through that again. \n\nSo, considering the brother's actions, the author's decision to not help seems reasonable. They aren't obligated to help someone who wronged them. The answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
