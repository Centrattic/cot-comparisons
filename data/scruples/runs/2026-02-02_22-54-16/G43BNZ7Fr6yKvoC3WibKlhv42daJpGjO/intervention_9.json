The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The author's brother previously cut them off when they were going through a messy divorce, and now the brother is reaching out again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a close relationship with their brother, but when they needed help with their own divorce, the brother didn't support them and even took the sister-in-law's side. The brother's wife was having an affair, and the brother didn't believe the author's warnings. Now, the brother is getting a divorce himself and wants help, but the author's current wife is against helping due to past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not responding, which could be seen as cutting off their brother again. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether they are.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a responsibility to help their brother despite past actions. The brother wronged the author, so it's understandable if the author is hesitant. The brother's wife's behavior was toxic, and the brother took her side, which caused a rift. Now, the brother is apologizing, but the author's wife is against helping. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries, especially after being wronged. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the history of betrayal and the current wife's stance, the author's decision to not help isn't necessarily wrong. They might be protecting their own well-being and respecting their wife's feelings. So the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
