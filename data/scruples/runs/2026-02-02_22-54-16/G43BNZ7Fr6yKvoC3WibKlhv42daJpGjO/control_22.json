The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close. The brother initially didn't help when the author was going through a messy divorce, and his wife was spreading lies about the author. Later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, he confronted them, but the brother took her side. This led to a two-year no-contact period. Now, the brother is getting a divorce after discovering the same affair, and he's asking for help, but the author's wife is against it because of past events.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The key points here are past behavior and current circumstances. The brother's past actions\u2014abandoning his brother during a crisis and taking his wife's side when confronted\u2014might justify the author's hesitation. Also, the brother's wife had a vendetta, which complicates things. The author had moments of anger but was drunk when sending those texts, which might mitigate the blame a bit.\n\nHowever, the brother is now in a similar situation, and maybe there's a chance for reconciliation. But considering the brother's past behavior and the wife's role in poisoning the relationship, it's understandable that the author is reluctant. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds pressure.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether past actions justify not helping now. Since the brother didn't support the author when needed, and the current situation is a repeat of the wife's infidelity, the author's decision not to help seems reasonable. The brother's previous betrayal and the wife's deceit create a valid reason for the author to prioritize their own well-being and their wife's feelings. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
