The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother had a messy divorce where the author sought help but was rejected. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother didn't support the author. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when confronted, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Then, after the brother realizes the truth, he reaches out, but the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not responding.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not helping. Let's break it down. The brother previously didn't support the author during a tough time, even when the brother's wife was against the author. Then he turned against the author. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's wife is upset because of past actions. The author had some harsh texts when drunk, but they might be excusable as emotional.\n\nThe key points are the brother's past behavior and the author's right to set boundaries. The brother didn't support the author when needed, so the author might feel justified in not helping now. However, the brother is now realizing his mistakes and seeking reconciliation. But the author's wife's objection and the brother's past actions complicate things.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were wronged before and might need to protect themselves. The brother's past behavior justifies the author's reluctance. So the answer is B (No).\n"
