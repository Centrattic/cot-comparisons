The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's going through a divorce. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother are the only family each other has. The author is 26, the brother 29. They were close before. The author had a failed marriage at 19, went through a messy divorce, and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support him. The brother's wife spread lies, and the author's then-wife supported him instead. After that, their relationship became distant.\n\nLater, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair. The author confronted them, but the brother took the wife's side and cut off contact. The author even sent some angry texts when drunk. Now, the brother is getting a divorce (same affair guy) and wants to reconnect, but the author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The key points are past behavior: the brother didn't help when needed, took his wife's side, and the author's wife is against helping. The author's actions (drunk texts) might be seen as harsh, but the brother was unresponsive before. The author is now in a stable marriage, and the brother's current situation mirrors the author's past. However, the brother's wife's infidelity was known, and the brother didn't believe the author.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family support is often expected, but the brother's past actions might justify hesitation. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation after being wronged. The brother's initial refusal to support and taking the wife's side might have broken trust. The author's wife's stance also adds pressure. So, the answer would depend on whether past actions justify not helping now. Given the brother's history, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not helping. Hence, answer B.\n"
