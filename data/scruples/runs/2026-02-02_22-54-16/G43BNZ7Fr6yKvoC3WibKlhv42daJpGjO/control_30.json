The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother who's going through a divorce. Let me read through the situation again to get the details straight.\n\nSo, the brother and the author were really close, but things went south. The author had a bad divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him, even making it worse by his wife spreading lies. Then, when the brother's marriage issues came up (his wife cheating), he took her side and cut off the author. Now the brother is in trouble again, sorry, and the author's wife is against helping. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are past actions. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it most, leading to a broken relationship. Then the brother's wife was having an affair, but he took her side, which is another betrayal. Now the brother is asking for help after realizing the truth, but the author might have been unkind when drunk. But the author's wife is against helping due to past events.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping. Well, the brother has a history of not supporting the author when needed. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation or cutting off someone who didn't support them. On the other hand, maybe there's a moral obligation as siblings. But the brother's actions were pretty hurtful. The author's wife is against it, which might be a factor in their decision. Also, the author's past actions (texting the sister-in-law some harsh words when drunk) might be a point, but they admit it's irrelevant. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The brother didn't support them when they needed it, and the author has every right to prioritize their own well-being. The past hurts and lack of support from the brother justify the decision not to help now. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
