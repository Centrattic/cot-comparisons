The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were close. The author had a bad divorce at 19, and when they asked for help, the brother was distant and unhelpful. The brother's wife spread lies, which affected their relationship. Then, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now, the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not responding.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. From the description, the brother didn't support the author during their time of need. The brother's wife was a problem, and the brother took her side even when the author confronted him. The author did text the brother's wife some harsh messages when drunk, but they admit that's irrelevant. \n\nSo, the brother's behavior was harmful and unsupportive. The author's current wife isn't supportive of helping him, which makes sense given the brother's past actions. The author is thinking of cutting off contact again. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about family obligations and past grievances. The brother didn't help when the author needed it, so the author might feel justified in not helping now. However, reconciliation is possible. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the brother's unkindness and betrayal, the author's decision to not help could be seen as self-protective. They might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the brother is genuinely sorry now. The author could choose to help despite the past. However, the wife's opposition is a factor. It's a personal choice. The brother's past actions include not supporting the author and taking the wife's side, which is pretty bad. The author's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, probably answer B (No), the author isn't in the wrong here because the brother was unhelpful and took sides against them. The author is within their rights to not help now, especially considering the past.\n"
