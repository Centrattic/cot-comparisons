The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but the brother didn't support the author during their messy divorce, instead being dismissive and influenced by his wife. Later, when the brother discovers his wife's affair, he comes back seeking help, but the author's wife is against helping because of past issues.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past behavior. He didn't support the author when they needed it, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. Now, he's asking for help after realizing his mistake. The author is considering not helping, given the history.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think it's important to consider the context. The brother wasn't there when the author needed support. The author's wife is opposed to helping, which adds to the pressure. The brother's wife had a vendetta and he took her side, leading to the fallout. Now, the brother is apologizing, but the author has valid reasons to feel hurt and not want to help. \n\nIn relationships, especially family, there's an expectation of mutual support. If the brother didn't provide that before, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being and past experiences. Also, the brother's wife's actions and the brother's initial refusal to believe the author played a role in the strained relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help, given the history of betrayal and lack of support. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
