The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping his brother during his divorce. The author's brother had previously not supported him during his own messy divorce, even going as far as cutting off contact after the author confronted his wife about an affair. The brother's wife was against the author, leading to the brother not supporting him. Now the brother is seeking help again, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The brother's past behavior was pretty harsh\u2014telling the author to \"get fucked\" and cutting him off after the author tried to help with his wife's affair. The author did reach out to his brother when he needed help, but the brother was unresponsive. Now, the brother is in a similar situation but the author is hesitant to reciprocate the support he didn't receive before.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's previous lack of support and the current wife's objections. The author has a right to prioritize his own well-being and his current family's wishes. The brother's wife's actions also played a role in their estrangement. The author's decision not to help might be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But given the brother's history of not supporting the author during a crisis, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The brother's actions caused lasting damage, so the author isn't obligated to help now. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting himself from past harm and respecting his wife's feelings.\n"
