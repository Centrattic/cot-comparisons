The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother had previously cut them off after the user confronted his wife about an affair, which he supported her in. Now, the brother is reaching out again, apologizing and seeking help, but the user's wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user went through a messy divorce at 19, and their brother didn't support them, which caused a rift. Then, when the brother was in trouble (his wife cheating), the user tried to help but the brother didn't believe them and ended the relationship. Now, the brother is coming back after two years of no contact, and the user is conflicted about whether to help again.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past behavior\u2014being unsupportive when the user needed help, taking his wife's side despite the user's warnings, and cutting off contact. The user texted the sister-in-law some harsh messages when drunk, but they consider it irrelevant. The brother is now apologizing, but the user's wife is upset about the previous experience and doesn't want to help again.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong if they choose not to respond. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, leading to a two-year estrangement. The user's wife is a significant factor here, as she's the one who supported the user through their own divorce. It might be reasonable for the user to consider their own experiences and their wife's feelings when deciding to not help again. However, the brother is now seeking reconciliation and admitting his mistakes. On the other hand, the user might feel justified in protecting themselves from potential further hurt, especially given the brother's previous lack of support and the lies from the brother's ex-wife.\n\nI should also consider if the user's response is about helping financially or emotionally. The brother might need support now, but the user's wife is against it. The user's own history of being wronged could influence their decision. It's possible that the brother's current situation is different, and maybe he's genuinely sorry. But the user has a right to be cautious, especially after the past betrayal.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether someone is being unreasonably harsh or withholding support without valid reasons. Here, the user's reasons are based on past experiences and their wife's feelings. The brother's past actions were selfish and hurtful, so the user might not be in the wrong for not helping again. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the brother's previous behavior and the user's justified trust issues, it's more likely that the user isn't the asshole here. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
