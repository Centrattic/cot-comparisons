The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me read through the situation again to get the details straight.\n\nThe author and his brother are the only family they have. The author had a bad divorce when he was 19, and he asked his brother for help, but the brother refused because his wife was spreading lies. The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, but he didn't support him then. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when he told his brother, he took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce too and wants help, but the author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history between the brothers. The brother didn't support the author during his tough time, and then took the wife's side when confronted. The author retaliated by texting the sister-in-law some harsh messages when drunk. Now, the brother is asking for help after realizing his wife was cheating, but the author is hesitant to help.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong by not helping. On one hand, the brother didn't support the author when he needed it, took the wife's side, and caused a rift. The author's wife is against helping because of that. On the other hand, the brother is now in a similar situation and is sorry. The author might feel justified in not helping because of the past betrayal. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The situation seems to be a matter of personal boundaries and past hurt. Since the brother didn't support the author and took the wife's side, the author might feel they don't owe help. Also, the brother's wife's actions were problematic. The author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them, especially given the history. The fact that the brother is now seeking help after being dismissive before might make the author's decision understandable. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
