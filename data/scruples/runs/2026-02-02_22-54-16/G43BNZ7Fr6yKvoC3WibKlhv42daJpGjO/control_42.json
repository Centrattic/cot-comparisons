The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's going through a divorce now. The brother and author were close but had a falling out in the past.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't help the author during their messy divorce and financial issues. The author's ex-wife's sister-in-law (the brother's wife) spread lies, which made the brother turn against the author. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when they confronted her, the brother didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and is asking for help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to support him because of past issues.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's break it down. The brother in the past didn't support the author during a tough time and even went against them. The author had to rely on their current wife for support. Then the brother's wife had an affair, and the brother didn't believe the author when they warned him. Now the brother is seeking help again, but the author is considering cutting contact again.\n\nThe key points here are past betrayals and the lack of support from the brother before. The author might feel justified in not helping because of the previous hurt. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But given the brother's history of not supporting the author and taking sides against them, maybe the author has valid reasons to not want to help now. Also, the brother's wife had an affair, and the brother didn't investigate, which shows poor judgment. The author might feel that helping now would just enable the brother again without accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off completely might be seen as harsh, but considering the brother's past actions, the author might be within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and their wife's wishes. The author's mental health was affected before, so they might want to avoid being dragged into another family crisis. The brother's recent actions of apologizing might warrant some support, but the history complicates it.\n\nI think the consensus here would be that the author isn't in the wrong because the brother didn't support them when they needed it, and the author has been through a lot. The brother's wife's behavior and his lack of support then make it understandable that the author is hesitant now. So the answer is B (No).\n"
