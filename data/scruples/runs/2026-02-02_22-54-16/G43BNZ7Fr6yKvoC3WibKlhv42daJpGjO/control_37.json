The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother are the only family they have. The author had a troubled marriage at 19, and during his divorce, he asked his brother for help, but the brother refused, influenced by his wife's lies. This caused a rift. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side, leading to a two-year no-contact period. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not helping now. Let's look at both sides. The brother wronged the author by not supporting him during his divorce and taking the sister-in-law's side. The author's wife is also against helping. The brother did apologize later, but the author might feel justified in not helping due to past harm. On the other hand, the brother is now in a similar situation, and maybe there's a chance for reconciliation.\n\nBut the author's past actions of texting the sister-in-law harsh things when drunk might be a point against them. However, the user says that's irrelevant. The key factors here are the brother's previous betrayal, the sister-in-law's role, and the current refusal from the author's wife. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation after being wronged, which might make them not in the wrong. Alternatively, family support might be expected regardless of past issues. But given the brother's history of not supporting the author when needed, the author might feel it's fair to not reciprocate now. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because of the prior harm done by the brother and the current lack of support from the author's wife.\n"
