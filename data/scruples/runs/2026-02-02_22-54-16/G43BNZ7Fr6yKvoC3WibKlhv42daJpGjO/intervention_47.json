The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but things went south when the author needed help during their own divorce. The brother didn't support them and even took his wife's side. Later, the brother's wife cheated, and he blamed the author, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe key factors here are past betrayals. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it most, and even turned against them. The author's wife supported them, so there's a strong current relationship. The brother's wife had an affair and the brother took her side, which adds to the tension. Now the brother is apologizing, but the author has valid reasons to be cautious.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong by not helping. Since the brother has a history of not supporting the author and the author's wife is against it, the author's decision to move on isn't necessarily wrong. People can set boundaries, especially after being hurt. The brother's past actions might justify the author's choice to not help now. So the answer is B.\n"
