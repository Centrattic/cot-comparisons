The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex with a lot of back and forth.\n\nFirst, the brother had a messy divorce when the author was 19, and the author asked for help but the brother didn't support them. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the author's marriage fell apart. Then, the author had a new marriage at 24, and later found out the brother's wife was cheating. When the author confronted the brother, he took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past events. The author is considering not responding.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping now. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. \n\nI need to consider the brother's past actions. He didn't help when the author needed it most, which is pretty significant. The author was in a crisis and the brother was dismissive. Then, when the author tried to help by exposing the affair, the brother was defensive and ended the relationship. The brother's wife cheated again, and the brother is now seeking support maybe too late. The author's wife is upset because of the previous treatment, and the author is feeling justified in not helping again. \n\nBut maybe there's a duty to help family, even if the brother was wrong before. However, the brother's behavior was toxic and didn't support the author during their time of need. The author might feel they can't just forget that. Also, the brother's wife was a problematic person twice, and the brother only realized the truth after the author's intervention. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They lost contact because the brother didn't believe them and took the wife's side. Now the brother is apologizing, but the author's wife is against helping. The author might be holding onto the past, which is understandable given the betrayal. \n\nBut should the author help now, regardless of past? Or is it okay to not help given the brother's previous actions? The brother's current situation is similar to the author's past, but the author might be wary of being used again. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's failure to support the author during a critical time and cutting off contact after the author tried to help. The author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't help them when they were vulnerable. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. The brother is apologizing now, so is it time to forgive? But forgiveness isn't the same as duty to help. The author can choose to set boundaries. \n\nAlso, the brother's wife had a vendetta and cheated again, which shows maybe the brother was in a toxic relationship. The author tried to help before, but the brother didn't listen. Now the brother is facing the same issue, but the author might be justified in not wanting to be in the same position again. \n\nSo, the author's decision not to help is reasonable given the history. They weren't the one who wronged first. The brother's actions were the initial problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
