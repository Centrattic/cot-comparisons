The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but the brother didn't help the author during their own messy divorce. Instead, the brother's wife was spreading lies, leading the brother to cut off support. The author then had to go through the divorce with the support of their current wife. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair, but the brother took her side and cut off the author. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past actions affecting current decisions. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it, took his wife's side over his brother, and cut off the author. Now the author is hesitant to help back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if the author has a valid reason. The brother's past behavior could be a justification for not helping now. The author's wife is also against it, which might influence the decision. The brother did apologize for not believing the author before, but the author might feel justified in their hesitation given the history. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But the brother's actions were pretty hurtful. The author was cut off and not supported when they needed it most. It's possible that the author is within their rights to not reciprocate, especially if they feel the brother didn't act appropriately before.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because of the brother's previous harmful actions and the lack of support. The author is just protecting themselves based on past experiences.\n"
