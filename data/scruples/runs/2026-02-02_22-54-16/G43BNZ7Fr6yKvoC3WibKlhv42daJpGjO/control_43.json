The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's messy divorce. The brother didn't help then, and later took his wife's side when the author confronted her about the affair. The brother cut off contact. Now, the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author's wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the main points here: the brother previously didn't support the author during a tough time, took his wife's side against the author's warning, and then cut off the relationship for two years. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author is hesitant due to past experiences.\n\nThe key factors here are past grievances and the brother's actions. The author has a history of being let down by his brother, both emotionally and financially. The brother's wife also had a vendetta, which the brother believed. The brother's response to the author's help was to accuse him and cut ties. Now, the brother is seeking help after realizing the truth about the affair, but the author is considering not helping because of the past.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The brother did wrong before, but now he's in a similar situation. However, the author has valid reasons to not want to help someone who previously didn't support him and then blamed him. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds to the pressure. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. From an ethical standpoint, while family support is generally encouraged, past betrayal can affect one's willingness to help. The brother's actions were harmful, and holding a grudge isn't uncommon. The author isn't obligated to help if he's not comfortable, especially given the history. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the brother's previous actions justify the author's decision to not help now. The author has reasons to protect himself from further emotional or financial strain after past mistreatment.\n"
