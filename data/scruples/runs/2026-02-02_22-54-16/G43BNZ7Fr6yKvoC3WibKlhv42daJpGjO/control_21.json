The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" post) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author have a history. The author's previous marriage ended messily, and when they sought help, the brother didn't support them and was influenced by his wife's lies. Then, the brother's wife cheated, he took her side, cut off the author, and there was some angry texting from the author when drunk. Now, the brother is getting a divorce because of the same affair, and the brother is asking for support. The author's wife is against helping, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe key factors here are past treatment and current circumstances. The brother previously didn't support the author during a crisis, took the side of the cheating spouse, and cut off the author. The author had a history of being close but the relationship deteriorated over these issues. Now, the brother is asking for help, but the author has valid reasons to be hesitant, especially given the brother's past behavior and the wife's opposition. \n\nThe author's consideration to not help is in response to prior wrongs. The brother's actions (not supporting, taking his wife's side) were significant and caused a rift. The author's decision to not help now might be seen as a response to these past harms. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. \n\nBut given the brother's history of not supporting the author during their own crisis, and the current situation where the brother's wife had an ongoing affair that the brother didn't address until now, the author might feel justified in not helping. The author's wife is against it, adding pressure. The author's mental health was affected before, and trusting the brother again could be a challenge.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family support is important, the author isn't obligated to help if there's a history of betrayal and lack of support. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, so the author's hesitation is understandable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help given the context.\n"
