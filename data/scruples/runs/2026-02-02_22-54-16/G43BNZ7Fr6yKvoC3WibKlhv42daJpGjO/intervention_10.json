The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's brother previously rejected him during a difficult divorce, then later the brother realized his wife was cheating and is now seeking help. The author's wife is against helping, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The brother didn't help the author during his divorce, which was a time of need. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother took her side over his own sibling. Then, when the brother later found out about his wife's affair, the author had warned him before, but he didn't believe him. Now the brother is seeking help, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the dynamics here. The brother had a history of not supporting the author when he was in need. The author was vulnerable and asked for help, but the brother refused, possibly influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the brother dismissed the author's warnings, which led to him discovering the affair later. Now, the brother is coming back for help after hurting the author twice.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might feel justified in cutting ties or not helping, especially after being let down before. The brother's actions were harmful, and the author's wife is also against helping. The author's decision to not respond could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. However, some might argue that family should help each other regardless of past issues. But in this case, the brother's past behavior was quite hurtful, so the author's hesitation is understandable. The key here is the brother's prior actions and the author's right to protect their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
