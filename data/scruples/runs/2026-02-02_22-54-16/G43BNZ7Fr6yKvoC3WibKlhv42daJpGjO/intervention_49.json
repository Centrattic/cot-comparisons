The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping his brother after a messy divorce. The brother previously didn't support the author during his own divorce, took the wife's side when she cheated, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a similar situation but the author's wife doesn't want to help him.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior was pretty bad. He didn't support the author when he needed help, took the side of his cheating wife, and broke off the relationship. The author tried to help in the past but was rejected. Now, the brother is in the same boat but the author is hesitant to help again, especially after the previous betrayal.\n\nThe author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author is considering cutting off contact again. The key here is whether the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past actions. Since the brother didn't support him when he needed it, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize his own well-being and his current family's wishes. The brother's wife's actions were manipulative, and the brother's lack of support back then is a significant factor. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries now. So the answer should be B.\n"
