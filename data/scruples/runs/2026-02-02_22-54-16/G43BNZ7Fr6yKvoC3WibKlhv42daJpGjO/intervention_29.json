The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong if they choose not to help their brother during his divorce. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were very close, but their relationship has been strained. The author went through a messy divorce earlier and asked for help from the brother, who didn't support them. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, leading the brother to turn against his sibling. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when the author confronted the brother, he didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is upset about the past. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are past experiences where the brother didn't support the author and took his wife's side. The brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother didn't believe the author's warning about her affair. The author's current wife is against helping him now, probably due to the past betrayal.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think about the dynamics here. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help. There was a betrayal, and the brother didn't believe the author. Now, when the brother is in a similar situation, the author is hesitant to help because of past pain. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of fairness, people often expect to reciprocate support in families. But if someone has wronged you before, it's reasonable to be cautious. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author's reluctance isn't necessarily wrong. The author might be protecting themselves from further harm. The brother's wife's behavior was toxic, and the brother didn't believe their own sibling. The author's decision to not help could be seen as a boundary, self-preservation, especially after being let down.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But if the brother didn't support the author before and was part of the problem, the author isn't obligated to help now. The author has their own wife supporting them now, which might be a reason to prioritize their current family over the strained sibling relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is more likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for not wanting to help after past betrayals. The brother's actions contributed to the current situation, so the author's decision isn't inherently wrong.\n"
