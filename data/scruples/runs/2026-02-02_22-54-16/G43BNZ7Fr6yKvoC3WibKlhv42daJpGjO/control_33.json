The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The story is a bit complex, so I need to unpack each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author used to be really close. The author had a failed marriage early on and asked his brother for help, but the brother didn't support him, partly due to his wife's influence. That led to a rift. Then the brother's wife had an affair, and when the author told him, the brother took her side, cut off contact, and the author even sent some angry texts when drunk. Now, the brother is getting a divorce from the same affair partner, and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: past betrayals from the brother, the brother's wife's role in lying about the author, the brother taking his wife's side, and the author's anger in the past. Now the brother is coming back for help. The author is hesitant because of past experiences, and their wife is against helping. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) question hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. In situations like this, people often consider past actions. The brother didn't support the author during his crisis, took the side of the cheating wife, and there was a history of betrayal. The author's reluctance might be justified given the brother's previous behavior. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. \n\nBut looking at the details, the brother's actions were quite hurtful. He didn't support his brother during a tough time, believed lies told by his wife, and cut off contact. The author's anger and texts were in the heat of the moment and they've had no contact since. Now the brother is seeking help, but the author has reasons to be cautious. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family bonds are important, the brother's past actions might have eroded the trust. The author isn't obligated to help if they feel wronged before. The brother's current request comes after a history of betrayal. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some people might argue that despite past issues, offering support could mend the relationship. But given the depth of the betrayal and the brother's lack of support in the past, the author's hesitation is understandable. The brother's wife's role in spreading lies also plays into this. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help, especially after being let down before. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
