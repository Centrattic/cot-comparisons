The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their brother were close, but when the author went through a messy divorce early on, the brother didn't help and instead was hostile. The brother's wife spread lies, and the brother took her side. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, which led to the brother cutting off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again, and the author's current wife doesn't want to help him because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo the core issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother now, given the past history. The brother was unhelpful when the author was in need, and then took the side of his wife against the author. The author might feel that the brother didn't support them when it mattered, so they might not want to reciprocate now. \n\nThe question is about moral responsibility. In many cases, people expect mutual support in family, but if someone has wronged you in the past, does that obligate you to help them when they're in trouble? The author's wife is against helping because of the past, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe brother's actions were hurtful\u2014dismissing the author during their divorce and not believing them about the affair. The author's anger at being called a cheater by their own brother might be justified. However, the brother is now reaching out, maybe realizing his past mistakes. \n\nBut the author has been through similar pain and might not want to go through that again. They might feel that the brother's past behavior doesn't warrant help now. On the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's previous lack of support and the betrayal by his wife. The author has a right to prioritize their mental health and not engage if they feel no remorse or change from the brother. The brother's current situation might be a result of his own past choices, so the author isn't obligated to help. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong given the brother's history of not supporting them and the wife's lies.\n"
