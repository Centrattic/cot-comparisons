The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce, given their past.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their own divorce and took his wife's side when she was cheating. The author's wife had been their support then. Now, the brother is seeking help, but the author's wife is against it because of past betrayal. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: past betrayal, lack of support from the brother before, and the current situation where the brother is now in a similar spot. The question is about moral obligation. \n\nIn some views, family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, if someone has wronged you before, it's understandable to be hesitant. The brother's previous actions were harmful, and the author might feel justified in not helping again. But others might argue that cutting off completely is harsh, especially since the brother is now in need. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer.\n\nBut considering the brother's past behavior\u2014disowning the author, taking his wife's side without evidence\u2014it's a pattern of not being supportive. The author had to rely on their own wife then. Now, the brother is in a similar situation. The author might feel it's a cycle they don't want to repeat. The brother's realization and apology come after the fact, but the author has valid reasons to be cautious. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If you believe family should always support each other regardless of past actions, then maybe yes. But if you consider the history of betrayal and the need for self-protection, then no. The author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't help them when it mattered. The answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong given the context.\n"
