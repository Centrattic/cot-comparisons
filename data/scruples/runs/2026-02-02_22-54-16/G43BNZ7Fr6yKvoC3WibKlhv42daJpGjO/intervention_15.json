The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their brother were close. The author had a troubled marriage that ended in divorce, and when they sought help, the brother didn't support them. Later, the brother's wife cheated, but he took her side and cut off the author. Now, the brother is facing his own divorce and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the past interactions. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it, and then took his wife's side when confronted about the affair. The author did text his sister-in-law some harsh things when drunk, but the user says that's irrelevant. The brother is now asking for help after cutting ties.\n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to help despite the past. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author had valid reasons for not supporting him now. The brother even took his wife's side, which is a significant betrayal. The author's wife is against helping, which might add to the pressure. The brother's previous behavior justifies the author's reluctance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have been wronged before, and it's reasonable to not want to repeat that support without trust.\n"
