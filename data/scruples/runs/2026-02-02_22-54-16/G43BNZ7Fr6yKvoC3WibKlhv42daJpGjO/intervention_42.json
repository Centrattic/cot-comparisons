The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details straight.\n\nThe author is 26, and their brother is 29. They were really close, but their relationship has been strained over time. The author got married at 19, which didn't work out, and during the divorce, they asked the brother for help but were rejected. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, and the author feels that the brother didn't support them during a tough time. After that, their relationship wasn't the same. Then, the author got married again at 24 and is still with their current wife. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair and confronted them, but the brother took her side and cut off contact. The author admits to sending some angry messages when drunk, but considers that irrelevant. Now, the brother is divorcing his wife again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The main issue is whether the author is obligated to help their brother after past grievances. Let's look at the brother's actions: he didn't support the author during their divorce, took his wife's side against the author, and cut off contact. The author, in turn, was angry and sent some messages when drunk. Now the brother is in a similar situation and is asking for help. The author is conflicted because they want to support their brother but also feel wronged in the past.\n\nI need to consider the moral aspects here. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother didn't support the author during a vulnerable time. The author's actions (texting the sister-in-law) were impulsive, but the brother had already cut off contact. The author's current wife is against helping, which might be a factor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping, given the brother's past behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother's actions were inconsiderate and harmful. The author's response, while not perfect (the drunk texts), was a reaction to being wronged. Now, the brother is seeking help after causing harm. The author isn't obligated to help if they feel it's unfair or if they don't want to. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the brother's past behavior, the author might feel justified in not helping.\n\nAnother angle: the brother had a chance to support the author but didn't. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own needs and not help someone who previously wronged them. The brother's current situation is similar, but the author isn't required to reciprocate help unless they choose to. The author's wife is against helping, which might reinforce the decision. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. The answer would be B.\n"
