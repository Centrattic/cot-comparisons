The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother had a history of not supporting the author during their own divorce, taking his wife's side against the author, and cutting off contact. Now, the brother is seeking help again, but the author's current wife is against it.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior was pretty harsh. He didn't support the author when they needed it most, which caused a rift. The author went through a tough time and the brother was dismissive. Then, when the author found out about the brother's wife's affair and tried to help, the brother turned on him. That's pretty hurtful.\n\nNow, the brother is coming back, sorry for not believing the author before. The author is considering not helping again. The key here is whether the author is obligated to help despite the past. Family dynamics can be complicated, but if someone has wronged you and isn't taking responsibility before, it's reasonable to be cautious. The brother's wife's actions and his support of her were harmful. The author's decision to not help isn't just about the past issues but also the wife's continued negative influence. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and past experiences. They don't have to be the \"good guy\" if it's at their own expense. The brother's actions have consequences, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries.\n"
