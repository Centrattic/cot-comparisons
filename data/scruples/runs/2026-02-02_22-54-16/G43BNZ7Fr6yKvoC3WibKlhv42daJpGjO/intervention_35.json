The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were close, but their relationship soured when the author was going through a messy divorce. The brother didn't support him and even cut off contact after that. The brother later found out his wife was cheating and now wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe key points here are the history of the brother's behavior. The brother previously didn't help when the author needed support, took his wife's side when accused of an affair, and cut off contact. The author is considering not helping again. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe author's actions here are a response to past treatment. The brother's previous actions were harmful, and the author is choosing not to repeat the cycle. The brother's wife's actions also played a role, but the author is the one deciding whether to help now. Given the history, the author's decision to prioritize his own well-being and not help might be justified. The brother's current request comes after years of no contact and past betrayal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual support in relationships. The brother didn't support the author when needed, so the author isn't obligated to reciprocate now. The author's choice to move on is understandable given the past. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
