My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, and the main issue is the boyfriend's video game playing habits. The author, a woman, is on maternity leave and taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone. The boyfriend is in school full-time.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author has been frustrated for a couple of years over her boyfriend prioritizing video games over spending time with her. After the baby was born, the problem seems to escalate. The specific incident that led to her breaking up is when he left to play a 40-minute game while she was dealing with the baby's mess, and then didn't understand why she was upset. She told him she would leave if he didn't stop, and he claims she's picking a fight.\n\nNow, considering the context: They have a newborn, which is a huge responsibility. The author is handling the baby alone all day while he's in school. His gaming time is a significant issue because it's during the time when she's already overwhelmed. The boyfriend agreed before that his gaming was a problem, but then repeated the same behavior. The author feels disrespected and unheeded, leading her to take a firm stance to end the relationship if he doesn't change.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, the boyfriend might not realize the emotional toll of his actions. However, the author has given him warnings and he didn't follow through, leading her to set a clear boundary. The question is whether her decision to leave is justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The boyfriend's actions (prioritizing games over helping) and the author's response (setting a boundary) are both from their perspectives. The author is standing up for her needs, which is valid. The boyfriend might not see the issue, but that doesn't make the author wrong for leaving. The fact that the baby is involved adds weight to the responsibility aspect. The author might feel unsupported, and if the boyfriend isn't willing to adjust after being told, her decision isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs and setting boundaries after repeated issues, especially in a high-stress situation with a newborn. The boyfriend's failure to meet her expectations after being warned could make her decision justified.\n"
