My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the woman is on maternity leave. She's frustrated with him playing video games a lot, especially when he comes home and plays while she's handling the baby alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman is clearly upset because she's taking care of the baby all day, and when her partner comes home, he's playing games instead of helping. The baby puked, and she had to deal with the mess alone. She told him before that this was a problem, and he agreed. But he still did it again, leading her to say she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's under a lot of stress from school and uses gaming as a way to unwind. He might not realize how his actions affect her, or maybe he thinks he's contributing in other ways. However, given that they have a newborn, the primary responsibility of both parents should be on the child's needs. The fact that he left to play when the baby was hungry and then ignored her crying while playing seems selfish and dismissive.\n\nThe woman has a valid point about feeling like she's taking a backseat. Communication is key in relationships, and he agreed to her concerns before but didn't follow through. Her reaction of telling him she's done and leaving if he doesn't change could be seen as a justified action after repeated issues, especially given the stress of caring for a newborn alone.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are neglecting his responsibilities and her emotional needs. The woman is setting boundaries after being ignored, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
