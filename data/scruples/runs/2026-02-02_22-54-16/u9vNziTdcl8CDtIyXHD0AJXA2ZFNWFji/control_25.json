My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the text) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author is upset about it, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The main points are that the boyfriend is in school full-time, the author is on maternity leave, and there's been a pattern of arguments about the gaming. The specific incident is when the boyfriend leaves to play during the baby's feeding, leading to a mess that the author has to handle alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author feels that the boyfriend isn't sharing the parenting responsibilities and is prioritizing games over their relationship and the baby's needs. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to not recognize the issue, as he agreed to stop a week before but then repeated the behavior. The author then gives an ultimatum, threatening to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nNow, considering the context: having a newborn is stressful. The author is dealing with the baby alone all day, and the boyfriend's lack of support is exacerbating the stress. The fact that he agreed to the problem a week earlier but then went back to the same behavior might indicate a lack of respect for her feelings. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after the incident where the baby puked and she had to handle everything alone. \n\nThe boyfriend's response seems dismissive. He doesn't understand why she's upset after being warned. This could be a communication issue, but it's also a sign that he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author's decision to set a boundary by leaving if the behavior continues is a way of prioritizing her own well-being and the health of the relationship. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong: The author hasn't acted out yet\u2014she's giving a final warning. She's tried to communicate her feelings multiple times, and the boyfriend hasn't changed his behavior despite agreeing to do so. The ultimatum is a response to consistent disrespect and neglect. So, she's taking a stand, which is a valid choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author isn't the one neglecting responsibilities; the boyfriend is. Her decision to leave is a result of her feelings being consistently disregarded. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
