My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays video games too much, especially after they've had previous arguments about it. \n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that he plays video games excessively, often prioritizing them over spending time with her and the baby. She's been upset about this for a couple of years and recently escalated the situation by telling him if he doesn't stop, she'll leave him.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Previous Agreements**: She mentioned they had an agreement less than a week ago where he agreed to not play during certain times. He broke that agreement by playing during the baby's feeding time when she was overwhelmed.\n2. **Impact on the Baby and Her Well-being**: The baby had a mess to clean up, and she had to handle it alone while he was gaming. This could be stressful, especially with a new baby.\n3. **Communication Breakdown**: He didn't understand her frustration after she told him she was upset. He seems to dismiss her feelings, which might indicate a lack of empathy or poor communication skills.\n4. **Her Decision to Leave**: She's setting a boundary that if he doesn't respect her boundaries, she'll leave. This is a significant decision, but it's her way of enforcing the agreement they previously had.\n\nPossible angles:\n- **Is she overreacting?** Some might say she's being too harsh for a situation where he's in school and maybe stressed, but given the context of ongoing issues and the impact on their family, her frustration is valid.\n- **Does he have a valid point?** If he feels the games are a way to decompress, maybe there's a middle ground. However, his actions after the agreement show a lack of consideration.\n- **Respect and Boundaries**: She's standing up for her needs, which is important in a relationship, especially with shared responsibilities as parents. If he's not respecting her boundaries, her decision to leave isn't unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all this, the woman isn't the asshole. She's communicated her needs clearly, and when he continues to disregard them despite prior agreements, her decision to leave is a reasonable response to protect her well-being and the baby's needs. The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect for her boundaries, making the author justified in her stance.\n"
