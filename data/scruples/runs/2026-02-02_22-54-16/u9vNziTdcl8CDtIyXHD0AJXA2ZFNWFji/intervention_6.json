My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation is between a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The author is a woman on maternity leave, and her boyfriend is a 27-year-old in school full-time. They've been arguing about him playing video games too much, and now after he does it again, she's threatening to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend agreed a week ago to not play during the baby's feeding time, but he did again. The baby puked, and she had to deal with it alone. He was playing 10 feet away while the baby was crying. The author says this is the last time she'll argue and that if he does it again, she's leaving. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, the key points are: open communication, mutual respect, shared responsibilities. They had a prior agreement, but he broke it. The author is feeling neglected and stressed, especially since she's on maternity leave and handling the baby alone. The boyfriend's behavior seems dismissive of her feelings and the baby's needs. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to consider the context. When one partner repeatedly ignores the other's feelings and agreed-upon boundaries, especially when a child is involved, it's a red flag. The author is trying to protect her own well-being and the baby's care. Threatening to leave because of a repeated issue after setting clear boundaries might be justified. \n\nI don't see any evidence that the author overreacted. The boyfriend didn't hold up his end of the agreement. The author is taking a stand for her needs and the child's care. So the answer is B.\n"
