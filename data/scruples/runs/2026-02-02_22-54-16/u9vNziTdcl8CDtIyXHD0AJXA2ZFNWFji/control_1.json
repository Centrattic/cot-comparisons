My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she'll leave him if he doesn't stop playing video games. \n\nFirst, the situation: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the woman is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. She feels neglected, especially since the baby was born. He agreed to change his behavior, but recently, he ignored her request again. She then threatened to leave him if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She set a boundary five days prior that if he plays during non-sleep times, it would upset her. He broke that boundary again. She felt it showed he didn't respect her or care about her feelings. She's at her limit and doesn't want to keep arguing.\n\nFrom her perspective, he's not respecting her or their child's needs. He's prioritizing gaming over being present when the baby is awake. She's handling the baby alone, which is a lot, and his actions after the agreement make her feel undervalued.\n\nHe thinks she's picking a fight, but she's pointing out that he didn't adhere to their previous agreement. His lack of response or action after she expressed her upset shows a lack of consideration. She's reached her breaking point, which is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: Threatening to leave a relationship when there's consistent neglect and broken agreements isn't necessarily wrong, especially when it's affecting the well-being of the family. She's trying to set a boundary after repeated issues. He's not taking her concerns seriously, so her reaction is a self-respect measure.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have handled it differently, like giving more warnings or seeking counseling. But given the context\u2014newborn stress, previous agreements broken\u2014it's reasonable for her to feel this is the last straw.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
