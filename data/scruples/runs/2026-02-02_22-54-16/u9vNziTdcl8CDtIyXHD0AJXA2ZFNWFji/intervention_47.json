My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is about the boyfriend playing too much video games, which the author feels is prioritized over her and their baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been struggling with this for a couple of years, and the problem has escalated since the baby was born. The boyfriend didn't take her concerns seriously even after they discussed it. The recent incident where he left to play games while the baby was hungry and then cried, leading to the author feeling unsupported, seems to be the breaking point.\n\nThe author gave clear warnings before, and the boyfriend didn't change his behavior. She's now setting a firm boundary by saying she'll leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend's reaction is to think she's picking a fight, which shows a lack of understanding or empathy towards her feelings and the stress of caring for the baby alone.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author has expressed her feelings multiple times, but the boyfriend hasn't acted on them. The author's decision to leave is based on her own self-respect and the lack of change despite her efforts. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and the well-being of her child, especially in a situation where the other person hasn't respected her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's response to it. So the answer should be B.\n"
