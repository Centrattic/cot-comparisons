My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's on maternity leave, is frustrated because her boyfriend spends a lot of time playing video games, especially after he comes home from school. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the author is handling most of the child care. The key incident happened when the baby was feeding, he left to play a 40-minute game, and during that time, the baby puked, leading to a mess that the author had to clean up alone. When she confronted him, he didn't seem to understand why she was upset.\n\nThe author had previously warned him about this issue, and he agreed to change his behavior. Now, after he ignores her request again, she threatens to leave him. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with a newborn, which is already a lot of work. Maternity leave is a time when the mother is likely already stressed and overworked. The boyfriend is a student, so maybe he's not contributing much to the childcare or household duties. The fact that he's playing games while she's alone with the baby could indicate a lack of support from his side.\n\nCommunication is a big part here. The author has tried to talk to him before, and he agreed to change his behavior. But he didn't follow through. That's a problem. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship, especially when there are children involved. The author is trying to make him aware that his actions are affecting her and the baby negatively. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is that he thinks she's overreacting. Maybe he feels he needs some downtime after school. But given the situation with the baby, his downtime is coming at a time when he's supposed to be helping. The fact that he didn't understand why she was upset after the incident suggests that he's not empathizing with her situation. \n\nThe author's reaction of threatening to leave is a strong move, but given the context, it's a last resort after repeated issues. She's been trying to communicate, and he's not listening. The baby's needs are primary, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up. So the author is trying to hold him accountable. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If he's not respecting her boundaries and not supporting her as a parent, then setting a clear boundary and walking away isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior is the issue here. The author is justified in feeling that her needs aren't being met, especially with the added stress of caring for a newborn alone. \n\nBut maybe there's more to the story. The boyfriend might have his own reasons for playing games, like stress relief. However, in a partnership, especially with a child, both people need to adjust their habits. The author's approach, while harsh, is a response to his continued neglect of her and the baby's needs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is not helping with the baby's care, leading to the author being overwhelmed. The author's threat to leave is a way to enforce change. Since communication has failed, taking a strong stance could be necessary. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
