My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend playing video games excessively, even after she's told him it's a problem, especially since they have a newborn. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, taking care of their four-month-old daughter. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming habits for a couple of years. The author feels neglected and that he prioritizes gaming over spending time with her. Recently, he agreed that it's inappropriate for him to play hours of games while she's alone with the baby. However, in the latest incident, he left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating, leading to her getting sick and needing care. The author confronted him, but he didn't understand her upset. She then told him she'd leave if he did it again.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the presence of a newborn adds significant stress and workload. The boyfriend's actions here could be seen as not supporting her in this critical time. Even though he did agree to change his behavior before, he didn't follow through, which might indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries. The author is standing up for herself and her needs, which is important, especially in a relationship where communication and mutual support are crucial. \n\nThe boyfriend's response, not understanding why she's upset, suggests he may not be fully aware of the emotional impact of his actions. The author's ultimatum could be a last resort after repeated issues. While some might argue she's being harsh, the context of a new baby and his inaction despite prior agreement might tip the balance in her favor. \n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend's actions (playing games while she's overwhelmed) are a valid reason for the author to set such a firm boundary. Given the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
