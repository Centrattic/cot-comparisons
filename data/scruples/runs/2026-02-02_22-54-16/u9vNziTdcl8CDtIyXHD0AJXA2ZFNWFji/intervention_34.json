My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too many video games.\n\nFirst, the context: they have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing issues with him prioritizing gaming over spending time with her. Recently, after he continues gaming despite her previous warning, she threatens to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author feels neglected, especially after having the baby. She's dealing with the baby alone, and he's not helping. He agreed to stop gaming when she brought it up before, but then he does it again. She's at her breaking point and decides to end the relationship.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, is she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her needs and setting a boundary. He didn't follow through on his agreement, which she had clearly communicated. Her decision is based on self-respect and the lack of change from him. It's her right to decide what she's willing to tolerate in a relationship.\n\nHe might argue that he didn't mean to ignore her, but his actions (playing games while the baby is crying) don't align with his agreement. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, but he didn't act on it. Her response is a culmination of stress and unmet needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think she's justified. The answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
