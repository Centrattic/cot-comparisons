My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games despite previous arguments. The situation involves them having a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time while the author is on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has a history of prioritizing gaming over spending time with her. They've had arguments about this for years. After the baby was born, it's gotten worse. The author is handling all the baby care alone, and the boyfriend comes home and immediately plays for hours. Even after she confronted him and he agreed to change, he did it again. This time, the baby puked, and he was still gaming. She told him she's done and will leave if it happens again. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, key points: The author has been consistently unhappy about the boyfriend's gaming habits, especially with the new baby. He agreed to stop but didn't. She set a boundary and followed through. He's not taking her feelings or the baby's needs seriously. The author is in a tough situation, balancing maternity leave and feeling isolated. The boyfriend doesn't seem to be acknowledging her concerns or the impact on their daughter.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for herself and her needs. He's not respecting her boundaries, so her response is understandable. The fact that he agreed before but still continued might indicate he's not willing to change. However, threatening to leave might be seen as extreme by some. But considering the circumstances\u2014caring for a baby alone and repeated disregard for her feelings\u2014it's a valid boundary. \n\nNo one should feel neglected in a relationship, especially with a newborn. Setting a limit after repeated issues is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he's not listening, which could be a bigger issue. So the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
