My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too much video games.\n\nFirst, the context is important. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The author is on maternity leave, so she's handling a lot of the childcare alone. The boyfriend's gaming has been a recurring issue for a couple of years, with arguments about him prioritizing games over spending time with her. Even after he agreed to change his behavior, he still played while she was dealing with the baby's mess and crying.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on their relationship and the well-being of their child. The author is clearly frustrated and feels neglected, especially since she's managing the baby's needs alone. The boyfriend's actions after agreeing to change suggest a lack of consideration for her feelings and the baby's care. \n\nThe author's response was to tell him she's done and that she'll leave if he doesn't stop. This is a significant step, but given the circumstances\u2014ongoing issues, the baby's needs, and the previous agreement\u2014it's a culmination of stress and feeling disrespected. She's not just being dramatic; she's trying to set a boundary after repeated failures in communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is overreacting, but his actions (playing during the baby's crying) indicate he might not be taking her concerns seriously enough. The situation seems to be a pattern where the author's needs are consistently overlooked, leading to her breaking point.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a response to his continued disregard for her and the baby's needs. She's trying to enforce a boundary after multiple attempts to resolve the issue. So, she's not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the root problem, and her decision to leave is a valid reaction to his lack of change.\n"
