My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a newborn.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is making her take the backseat, especially since she's handling the baby alone. After the baby was born, she's been more upset. The example given is when he left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating and then came back to her crying. The author told him this was the last time she'd argue, and next time she'd leave.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's being respectful to herself by not staying in a relationship where her partner doesn't care about her feelings. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her needs and boundaries. She's had previous arguments, and he agreed to change. But he didn't follow through. The situation with the baby puking and her being alone is stressful. The author's threat to leave is a last resort after repeated issues.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend might feel that gaming is a way to unwind, especially since he's in school. But the author is the one handling the baby's needs alone, which is a lot. The key is whether his gaming is neglecting his responsibilities or disregarding her feelings. Since the baby is only four months old, the demands are high, and the author is on maternity leave, so her time is consumed with the baby.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions here (leaving during the baby's feeding) led to a messy situation that the author had to handle alone. The author's response was to set a clear boundary because previous attempts to communicate didn't work. She's not being aggressive beyond stating her limits. The boyfriend's not respecting her previous warnings might justify her decision.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend didn't take her concerns seriously after agreeing to change, leading to the author feeling disrespected. Her decision to leave under these circumstances is a valid response to his lack of respect for her feelings and the family's needs.\n"
