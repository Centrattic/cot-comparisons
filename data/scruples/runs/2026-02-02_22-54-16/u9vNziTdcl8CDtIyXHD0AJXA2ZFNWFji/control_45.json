My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave.\n\nThe main issue is the boyfriend's gaming habits. The author feels neglected because he plays video games a lot, even after they had a conversation about it. The key incident happened when the baby needed care, and he left to play a 40-minute game. The baby puked, and the author had to handle everything alone. She told him she's done and threatened to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is taking care of the baby alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend, despite being in school and presumably having a job, isn't contributing much outside of school. The author had previously discussed the issue, and he agreed to change but didn't follow through. His actions here seem dismissive of her feelings and the baby's needs.\n\nThe boyfriend might argue that he's busy with school and doesn't have much time to unwind, but the author is on maternity leave and is handling the baby's needs alone. The fact that he left to play games during the baby's feeding time, when she was already struggling, shows a lack of support. The author's frustration is understandable. She's under a lot of stress and needs help, but he's not providing it. \n\nThe author's response was to set a clear boundary and say she's leaving if it happens again. That's a valid way to communicate her needs, especially after repeated issues. The boyfriend dismissing her as picking a fight suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue. The author is within her rights to set boundaries and prioritize her well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
