My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who plays video games excessively, especially after the birth of their four-month-old daughter. The author, who is on maternity leave, is handling most of the baby care alone, and the boyfriend's gaming habits are causing conflict. The key event is when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is up and crying, leading to the author threatening to leave the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so maybe he has a demanding schedule. However, the author is on maternity leave and managing the baby's needs alone. The boyfriend's actions are not just about gaming but about neglecting his responsibilities when the baby needs attention. The author has previously communicated her concerns, and the boyfriend still ignores them, which shows a lack of responsiveness to her needs. The incident described is a direct example of this pattern\u2014playing games while the baby is crying, which could be seen as neglecting his role as a parent and partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He doesn't understand why she's upset and thinks she's picking a fight. This suggests he's not acknowledging the validity of her feelings, which can be hurtful. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on the belief that he doesn't respect or care about her feelings. She's setting a boundary after repeated issues, which is a reasonable response to a relationship that isn't meeting her emotional needs.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). From the information given, the author is standing up for herself after consistent problems. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here\u2014his failure to meet the needs of his partner and child. The author's threat to leave is a consequence of his actions, not an unprovoked attack. Therefore, she's not the asshole; the boyfriend's actions are the root of the problem.\n"
