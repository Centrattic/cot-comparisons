My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a mother with a four-month-old daughter, and her boyfriend is in school full-time. The main issue is his video game playing. They've had arguments about this for a couple of years, and the author feels like she's taking a back seat to his gaming. Since the baby was born, she's been more upset because she's handling all the childcare alone while he plays games when he comes home.\n\nThe specific incident mentioned is when the baby was hungry and needed to eat, then the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked, and the author had to clean up without help. She was upset and told him he shouldn't have gone to play, but he didn't understand why she was upset. The author then told him she's done and that the next time he does this, she'll leave.\n\nHe thinks she's picking a fight, but she says she told him five days ago that she's not okay with him playing then. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is on maternity leave, so she's likely handling most of the childcare responsibilities. The boyfriend is in school, so his schedule might be demanding too. However, even if he's busy, when he's home, the expectation is that he's helping with the baby. If he's choosing to play games instead of assisting, especially after being told that it upsets her, that's a problem.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author has expressed her concerns multiple times, and the boyfriend didn't heed her warnings. She's trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions after being warned could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nWhen the baby puked and needed attention, the author was alone. The boyfriend's choice to play instead of helping during that time is problematic because the baby is a shared responsibility. The author's frustration is valid because she's not getting the support she needs as a new mother. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to tell him she's leaving if he continues. Some might argue that this is too harsh, but given the context of ongoing issues and lack of change from his side, it's a reaction to a pattern of behavior that's affecting their relationship and the well-being of the child. \n\nIn terms of the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel like he's being unfairly criticized or that his gaming is a way to unwind after school. But the fact that he didn't help when the baby needed him most, even after prior discussions, suggests a lack of consideration for his partner's needs. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for herself and setting boundaries in a situation where her partner isn't meeting her expectations. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here, not the author's response to them. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
