My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in a relationship) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he continues to play video games despite previous arguments. The situation involves them having a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time while the author is on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend has a history of prioritizing gaming over spending time with her and their daughter. The woman feels neglected and stressed, especially since she's handling most of the baby's needs alone. She confronted him before about this, and he agreed to change. However, the recent incident where he left to play games while the baby was crying shows that he hasn't followed through, leading her to threaten leaving.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The woman is clearly overwhelmed. Maternity leave can be exhausting, and having a partner who isn't supportive adds to the stress. The boyfriend's actions (playing games when the baby is in distress) seem dismissive of her needs and the baby's. His agreement to change but then not following through indicates a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe author's response\u2014threatening to leave\u2014is a strong action, but it's in response to ongoing issues and a failure to address her concerns. It's a reaction to being undervalued and stressed. While it's a serious step, given the circumstances, it's understandable. The boyfriend's behavior, on the other hand, shows a lack of consideration and responsibility, especially with their child involved. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether her reaction is proportionate. She gave multiple chances, set clear boundaries, and he ignored them. Her frustration is justified. The boyfriend's inaction in a critical situation (baby crying) is a red flag. So, the author isn't the one in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
