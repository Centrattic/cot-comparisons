My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend playing too many video games, especially after they have a newborn. She's been telling him about the issue, he agreed to change, but then he didn't follow through again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The writer is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby's care alone. The boyfriend's gaming is getting in the way of helping with the baby, which is causing stress and conflict. The key points here are the ongoing issue, the communication (she's told him multiple times), and his failure to act on her concerns despite agreeing to change.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my assessment. The options are A (she's in the wrong) or B (she's not). \n\nLooking at the situation, the boyfriend's consistent behavior is the main issue. He's been warned, even agreed to stop gaming when the baby isn't sleeping. Then, when the baby is hungry, he leaves to play for 40 minutes, leading to a mess and crying. The author feels disrespected and overwhelmed. She's reached her breaking point, so she threatens to end the relationship if he doesn't change.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author tried to address the problem multiple times. The boyfriend's actions don't show respect for her feelings or the practical needs of caring for the baby. The author's reaction, while strong, is a result of being pushed to her limit. She's not being unreasonable here; she's prioritizing her self-respect and the health of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend's actions are the main problem. The author isn't the asshole here because she's standing up for herself after repeated failed attempts to resolve the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
