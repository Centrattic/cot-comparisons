My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The author is on maternity leave, handling a lot of the childcare, and her boyfriend (the father) is playing video games a lot. They've been arguing about this for a couple of years, and the situation has gotten worse with the baby's arrival.\n\nThe key points: The boyfriend is in school full-time, so maybe he has less time, but the author is saying he's prioritizing games over being there for her and the baby. There was an incident where the baby was crying while he was playing, and she had to deal with the baby alone. She told him she'd leave if he didn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that she's been clear about her boundaries, and when he still doesn't change his behavior, she's decided to end the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider her perspective. After childbirth, the stress and workload are immense, especially if you're on maternity leave and handling most of the childcare. If the partner isn't supporting her and is instead retreating into video games, that's a valid frustration. She's communicated her feelings, he agreed to change, but then reverted to the same behavior. That's a pattern that could indicate he doesn't take her concerns seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's using gaming as a way to decompress after school. Maybe he thinks he's contributing in other ways, or perhaps he's not aware of the emotional impact of his actions. But the fact that he agreed to change and then didn't follow through might mean he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe author is standing up for herself after a pattern of neglect. She's reached a breaking point, which is understandable. The community on AITA often looks at communication and attempts to resolve issues before the ultimatum. Since she's tried to talk to him and he didn't change, her decision to leave isn't out of line. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight might indicate he's dismissive of her valid feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs and setting a boundary after repeated issues. The answer should be B.\n"
