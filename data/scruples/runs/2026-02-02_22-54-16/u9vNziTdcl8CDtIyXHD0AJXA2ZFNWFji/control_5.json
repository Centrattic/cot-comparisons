My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games despite previous arguments. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. She feels neglected, especially since the baby was born. She told him before that playing games while she's handling the baby alone is frustrating. He agreed, but recently he still left to play when the baby was feeding, leading to her having to deal with the mess alone, and he didn't understand her upset.\n\nShe then told him she's done and will leave if he continues. He thinks she's being unreasonable. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, from her perspective, she's dealing with a new baby, which is exhausting, and her partner isn't stepping up. He's in school, so maybe his time is limited, but she's handling the majority of childcare. His actions (playing games) are seen as dismissive of her needs and the baby's needs. She's set a boundary and followed through when he crossed it again. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that he's balancing school and trying to decompress with gaming, which is a common stress reliever. However, he did agree to her concerns before, then repeated the behavior, which shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for her feelings, communication, and whether his actions are undermining their relationship. Since he agreed to her concerns but then continued the behavior, her feeling that he doesn't care or respect her is valid. Threatening to leave because of repeated disrespect is a personal choice, but in this context, she's asserting her needs after he's failed to meet them multiple times. \n\nIn relationships, when someone's actions consistently disregard their partner's feelings despite discussions, it's reasonable for the affected partner to take a stand. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
