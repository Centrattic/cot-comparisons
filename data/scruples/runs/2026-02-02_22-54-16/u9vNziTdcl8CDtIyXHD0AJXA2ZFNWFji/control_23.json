My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author, who's on maternity leave, feels she's handling all the baby duties alone. The boyfriend comes home, the baby needs to eat, but he leaves to play a 40-minute game. The baby pukes, and the author has to clean up alone. She confronts him, but he doesn't understand. She then tells him she's done and will leave if he keeps doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is dealing with a newborn, which is already a lot. Maternity leave can be exhausting, and she's doing everything by herself. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so his schedule might be packed, but he's supposed to be helping. The key points here are communication breakdown and lack of support from the boyfriend.\n\nHe agreed earlier that he wouldn't play during the baby's sleep, but he still does. That's a pattern of not respecting her boundaries. She's given him multiple chances to change his behavior, but he hasn't. The author is setting a boundary by saying she's leaving if it happens again. Is that too harsh? Well, if someone is in a relationship and the other partner consistently ignores their boundaries despite clear communication, it's reasonable to want to end it. The boyfriend's actions show he's not considering her feelings, which is a red flag.\n\nBut wait, could there be another side? Maybe the boyfriend is stressed from school and uses gaming to unwind. However, the author is in a vulnerable position with a newborn, and he's not stepping up. The fact that he doesn't understand why she's upset suggests a lack of empathy. The author's frustration is valid because she's handling all the baby care alone, which can lead to resentment and burnout.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He's not contributing as much as he should, especially with a new baby. The author is standing up for herself and her needs, which is important. Setting a boundary here isn't inconsiderate; it's self-respect. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
