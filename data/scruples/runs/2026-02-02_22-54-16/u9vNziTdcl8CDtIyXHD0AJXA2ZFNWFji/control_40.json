My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. She's been dealing with this issue for a couple of years, feeling like she's taking a backseat to his gaming. After the baby was born, the problem intensified. She confronted him before, and he agreed to change. But then he went ahead and played a 40-minute game while the baby was crying, leading her to threaten leaving him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend might feel he's under stress from school and using games as a coping mechanism. However, the author is managing the baby alone, which is a significant responsibility. The incident where the baby puked and she had to handle it alone while he was gaming is a key point. The fact that he agreed to change before but didn't act on it shows a pattern.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. She's trying to communicate her needs and boundaries, which is important in any relationship. Threatening to leave is a strong move, but it's a reflection of her feeling unheard and disrespected. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, communication and respect are crucial. If he's not respecting her boundaries and the well-being of their child, her decision to set a firm limit might be seen as necessary. The boyfriend's inability to understand her distress after being warned could indicate a lack of empathy or prioritization. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and her daughter's needs. The boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) in response to previous warnings might be the root issue here.\n"
