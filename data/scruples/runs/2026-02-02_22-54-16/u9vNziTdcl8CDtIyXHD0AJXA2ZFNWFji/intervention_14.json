My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend playing video games excessively, especially after their daughter was born, and the author threatening to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. So the author is handling a lot of the childcare duties. She's been arguing about gaming frequency for a couple of years, which escalated after the baby was born. The key incident happened when the baby was crying while he played, despite agreeing before that he'd cut back. The author then told him she's had enough and would leave if he continued.\n\nThe main points to consider: the author is stressed due to sole childcare responsibilities, the boyfriend isn't helping as agreed, and there's a history of unresolved conflict. The boyfriend's response after the incident seemed dismissive, thinking she was picking a fight. The author feels disrespected and that her concerns are ignored.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, threatening to leave a relationship over a recurring issue where the partner isn't meeting their responsibilities could be seen as a last resort. But the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is a significant issue. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the threat of leaving might be seen as extreme, but given the context of being overwhelmed and the lack of change despite prior warnings, maybe not.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend wasn't helping with the baby and continued to play games despite previous agreements, then her standing up for her needs isn't the problem. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The author is setting a boundary after being ignored, which is valid. So the answer would likely be B (she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe she didn't communicate better or sought other solutions first. However, the post mentions she had previously warned him and he agreed to change, but then failed again. So her reaction is justified.\n"
