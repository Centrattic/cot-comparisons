My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, and the author is upset about it, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby care alone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple has been arguing about the gaming for a couple of years. The author feels neglected, like the boyfriend prioritizes gaming over their relationship. After the baby was born, the situation seems to get worse. The author confronts him, he agrees to change, but then he goes back to playing for 40 minutes while the baby is crying. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but she feels she's justified because he broke his agreement to not play during certain times.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations in relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate and support each other, especially when there are children involved. The boyfriend's actions of playing games while the baby is crying might be seen as neglecting his responsibilities as a parent and a partner. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of follow-through after agreeing to change could indicate a lack of respect for her feelings and the previous agreement.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend is in school full-time. Maybe he's under a lot of stress and uses gaming as a coping mechanism. However, the author is on maternity leave and dealing with a newborn, which is also stressful. The key point is that the boyfriend didn't take the author's concerns seriously after agreeing to make changes. That's a problem because he's not respecting her feelings or the child's needs.\n\nThe author's response is to threaten leaving if he doesn't stop. Is that over the line? Well, she's stating her boundaries and the consequences if they aren't respected. In a relationship, setting consequences for negative behavior is a form of self-respect. However, threatening to leave might come off as extreme. But given the context of prior arguments and the recent incident, it's a last straw scenario. She's exhausted and feels unsupported, so her reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author isn't the asshole. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries and the child's needs. The author is advocating for herself in a situation where her partner hasn't followed through on his commitments. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
