My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games despite her repeated complaints, especially after the birth of their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. The author feels she's taking a back seat to his games. There was a specific incident where the baby puked, and he was playing games instead of helping, leading the author to tell him she'd leave if he didn't stop.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author has told her boyfriend multiple times that his gaming negatively affects their relationship, especially after the baby's birth. He agreed to change, but then repeated the behavior. The author felt it was the last straw and threatened to leave. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but she believes she's justified because he didn't respect her boundaries.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. From what's described, the author has communicated her concerns clearly. The boyfriend didn't follow through on his agreement. The situation is stressful with a new baby, and the author feels overwhelmed and unsupported. Her actions stem from feeling disrespected and neglected. The boyfriend's response (not understanding why she's upset) might indicate a lack of empathy or failure to see her perspective.\n\nHowever, some might argue that threatening to leave is extreme, but given the repeated failures to address the issue and the high stress of caring for a newborn alone, it could be seen as a reasonable decision. The author is asserting her needs and self-respect, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's gaming habits are impacting both their life quality and the author's well-being. If he's not willing to adjust despite clear communication, the author's choice to leave might be justified.\n\nI need to consider if there's any indication the author overreacted. The specific incident described is a direct example of the problem she's been having. She gave him a clear warning, and he still continued the behavior. Her response was a final warning after multiple attempts to resolve the issue. In that case, she's not in the wrong for holding him accountable. The boyfriend's lack of understanding suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is a valid reason for her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she has communicated her needs and boundaries clearly, and the boyfriend's actions have shown a lack of respect for those boundaries despite prior agreements.\n"
