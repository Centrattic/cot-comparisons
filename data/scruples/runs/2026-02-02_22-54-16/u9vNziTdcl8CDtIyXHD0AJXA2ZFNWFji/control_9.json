My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she'll leave him if he keeps playing video games.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. She feels neglected, and since the baby was born, it's gotten worse. He agreed to change his behavior after she got mad, but he relapsed recently by playing a 40-minute game while the baby was crying nearby. She told him she's done and would leave if he doesn't stop, and now he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, considering the context, she's dealing with a new baby alone all day, then he comes home and ignores her and the baby's needs by gaming. The baby even puked during this time, and he was nearby but didn't help. She had a prior agreement with him about not gaming during certain times, but he broke that again. \n\nHer main points are: she's exhausted, he's not respecting her boundaries, he's not helping with the baby, and he's dismissive of her feelings. She's standing up for herself and her needs, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that she's overreacting, but his actions show a lack of consideration. She's given him chances to change, and he hasn't followed through. In relationships, especially with new parents, communication and compromise are key. If one partner consistently disregards the other's needs and boundaries, it's valid to consider the relationship's future.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting clear boundaries after repeated issues. Her decision is based on self-respect and the well-being of the relationship. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
