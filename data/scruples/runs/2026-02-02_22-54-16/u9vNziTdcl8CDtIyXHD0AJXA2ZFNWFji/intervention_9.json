My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he's playing too much video games, especially after she told him not to. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The author is on maternity leave, handling the baby all day alone. She's been upset about him gaming instead of helping. The key incident here is when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to her getting puked on and needing to clean up, and he's still playing even after she's upset. She tells him she's done and might leave next time he does this.\n\nSo, factors to consider: the stress of caring for a newborn alone, the boyfriend's apparent lack of support, and the fact that he went against previous agreements. The author communicated her feelings before, and he still didn't act. She's feeling disrespected and overwhelmed. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's trying to make him take her feelings seriously. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might not realize the impact of his actions or might not be prioritizing her and the baby's needs. But the fact that he agreed before and then repeated the same behavior is a problem. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She's standing up for herself after repeated issues. The threat to leave is a strong action, but given the circumstances and his lack of change, maybe it's justified. The question is about whether she's the asshole here. The community usually considers intentions and context. Her intention is to set a boundary after being hurt, which is understandable. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. So, likely, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
