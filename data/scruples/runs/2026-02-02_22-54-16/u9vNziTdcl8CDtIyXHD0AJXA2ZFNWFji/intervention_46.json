My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend spending a lot of time playing video games, which the author feels is making her take the back burner in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been arguing about this for a couple of years, and after the baby was born, it's gotten worse. The boyfriend agreed that the gaming was a problem recently, but then he repeated the behavior. The specific incident where the baby puked and needed care while he was playing seems like the breaking point. The author told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's doing all the childcare alone, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up. Even after he agreed to change, he didn't follow through. She feels disrespected and is setting a boundary. That makes sense. People need boundaries in relationships, especially when there are children involved. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglecting his responsibilities as a parent, which is a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not see his gaming as a problem. He could be under stress from school and using games as an escape. But the problem is that it's affecting the family. The author is handling the baby all day, and his lack of support is causing her stress. He agreed to make changes but didn't act, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's response was to set a clear boundary. If he doesn't stop, she's leaving. That's a personal choice, and if he's not respecting her needs or the baby's, then leaving might be justified. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary. I don't think so. She's communicating her needs and taking action when his behavior doesn't change. The boyfriend isn't respecting her and the baby's needs, so her decision to leave isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
