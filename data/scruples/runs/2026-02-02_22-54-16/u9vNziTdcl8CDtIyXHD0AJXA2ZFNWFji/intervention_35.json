My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because of his gaming habits. \n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about the boyfriend playing video games too much, especially after the baby was born. The author feels neglected and frustrated because she's handling most of the baby's care alone, and he's playing games instead of helping. \n\nThe specific incident mentioned is when the baby was hungry, took 10 minutes to eat, and then the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game. The baby puked, and the author had to clean up alone. When he comes back, he's confused about why she's upset. The author then tells him she's done and will leave if it happens again.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\n1. **Emotional and Physical Burden**: The author is on maternity leave, which likely means she's managing the baby's care primarily. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he's not in a position to help as much. But still, when he's home, he plays games instead of helping. This seems to add to her stress and workload.\n\n2. **Previous Agreement**: The author mentions they had a conversation less than a week ago where he agreed that playing games while she's struggling is inappropriate. Now he breaks that agreement, leading to the incident. His actions after agreeing to change suggest a lack of follow-through or disregard for her feelings.\n\n3. **Communication**: The author explicitly told him not to play during those times. He didn't adhere, and when confronted, he didn't understand her anger. This indicates a possible communication breakdown or lack of empathy on his part.\n\n4. **Her Response**: She threatened to leave if it happened again. Is this an overreaction? Considering her stress and the previous agreement, she's trying to set boundaries. She's also a new parent, which is a high-stress time. Her frustration is understandable.\n\n5. **Is She in the Wrong?** For her to set a boundary and follow through if it's not respected might be reasonable. However, the question is whether she's wrong for doing so. The boyfriend's actions are the root issue here. If he's not fulfilling his responsibilities and ignoring her concerns, her decision to leave could be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that threatening to leave after one incident is extreme, especially if he didn't intend to violate their agreement. But considering the context and her prior efforts to communicate, it's more about his lack of respect and her taking a stand for herself. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to ongoing neglect and a lack of respect from her partner. She's in a vulnerable position as a new parent with little support. Her decision to set a firm boundary and walk away if it continues isn't unreasonable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
