My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she'll leave him if he doesn't stop playing video games. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. She feels she's being neglected and that he's prioritizing games over their relationship and the baby. After a recent incident where he played games while the baby puked and cried, she told him she's done and would leave if he doesn't change.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on their daughter and the author's mental state. The boyfriend seems to not take her concerns seriously, even after agreeing to change. The author is under a lot of stress from caring for a newborn alone and expects support. The boyfriend's actions might be seen as dismissive, not just of her feelings but also of their child's needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From my understanding, setting boundaries in a relationship, especially when there are children involved, is reasonable. The author is trying to communicate her needs clearly. The boyfriend's lack of response to her previous warnings could indicate a pattern of ignoring her needs. The author's decision to end the relationship if things don't change is her right, given the circumstances. She's not asking him to stop gaming entirely but to prioritize family responsibilities. So, the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
