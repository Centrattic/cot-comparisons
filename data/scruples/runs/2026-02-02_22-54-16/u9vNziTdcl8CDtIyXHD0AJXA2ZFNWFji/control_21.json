My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is the asshole. The scenario involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the woman is on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the woman feels neglected, especially when he plays while she's dealing with the baby alone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman has been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. She feels she's taking the backseat. He's been making comments about needing her to suggest activities for them. After the baby was born, the problem escalated. She confronts him, he agrees to change, but then he repeats the behavior. The last incident involved him leaving to play a 40-minute game while the baby was hungry, leading to a mess she had to clean up alone. She told him she's done and will leave if he continues. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she argues he ignored her previous warnings.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The woman is handling the baby alone, which is a lot of work, especially as a new parent. The boyfriend's gaming is interfering with his parental duties. He agreed to change after being told, but then didn't follow through. The woman is setting a boundary, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he doesn't see the problem, which might indicate a lack of support or respect.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it fair to set such a boundary? Did she give him enough chances to change? Is gaming a reasonable activity that's being overstepped? The fact that he's in school might mean he's stressed, but that doesn't excuse neglecting family responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the woman is on maternity leave, so maybe she's more available, but that doesn't mean the boyfriend should avoid helping. Co-parenting is important, especially with a new baby. If he's not contributing, that's a valid issue. Her ultimatum is a strong step, but given the repeated behavior despite prior warnings, maybe she's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be miscommunication? The boyfriend might not realize how his actions affect her. But she has clearly communicated her feelings multiple times, and he still didn't change. The final incident seems to be a breaking point.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might think she's being too harsh, but others would see her setting necessary boundaries. The key is whether the boyfriend's actions are neglecting his responsibilities as a co-parent. If he's not helping and is instead isolating himself in gaming, that's a problem. The woman's frustration is understandable, and her decision to leave if it continues is her right if she feels disrespected.\n\nSo, leaning towards B (she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior has been inconsiderate, and she's setting a boundary after multiple attempts to resolve it. The fact that he dismissed her feelings and repeated the behavior shows he didn't take her concerns seriously. Her final action is a reaction to his continued neglect, so she's not the asshole here.\n"
