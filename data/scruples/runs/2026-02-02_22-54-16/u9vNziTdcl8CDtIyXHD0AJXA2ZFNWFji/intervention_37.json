My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling her boyfriend that if he doesn't stop playing video games, she'll leave him. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The author is on maternity leave, so she's handling a lot of the baby's care alone.\n\nThe boyfriend has a history of prioritizing gaming over spending time with her, and after the baby's birth, it's become more frustrating. The key incident was when the baby was crying, he went to play a game, and she had to deal with the baby's mess alone. The author told him this was the last straw and that she'd leave if it happened again. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she's standing her ground.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend's actions: he agreed to the author's concerns previously but then repeated the behavior. The author is exhausted from being the sole caregiver and feels disrespected. Her response was to set a boundary and state her intention to leave if it continues. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is important. The author has tried to address the issue multiple times, and the boyfriend hasn't changed his behavior despite agreeing to do so. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging her feelings. The author is taking a stand for her own well-being and self-respect.\n\nThe baby's needs are also a factor. The boyfriend's absence during the baby's distress might be contributing to the author's stress. It's reasonable for her to expect support, especially after the baby's birth. The fact that he's in school might mean he's busy, but he still has responsibilities as a partner and parent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is standing up for herself in a situation where her needs are being neglected. Her response, while drastic, is a boundary she's set after repeated issues. The boyfriend's lack of change after agreeing to consider her feelings might make him the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
