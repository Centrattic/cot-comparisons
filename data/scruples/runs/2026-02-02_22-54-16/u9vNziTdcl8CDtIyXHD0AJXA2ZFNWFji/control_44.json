My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games a lot, which the author feels is taking priority over their relationship and her needs. The key incident happened when he left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was hungry, leading to her puking and the author having to handle everything alone. The author then told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with the challenges of caring for a newborn, which is already a lot. The boyfriend's gaming is causing her to feel neglected and unsupported. The fact that he agreed to change his behavior after previous arguments but then repeated the same action might indicate a lack of follow-through on his part. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on feeling that her partner isn't respecting her feelings or the challenges she's facing. She's reached her breaking point after multiple arguments. The boyfriend's response, not understanding why she's upset, suggests he may not be fully acknowledging her perspective. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author did confront him, it's about whether her ultimatum is justified. It's a personal decision, but given the circumstances and the partner's repeated behavior despite prior warnings, her decision to set a firm boundary isn't unreasonable. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author should have tried more solutions before threatening to leave. But considering the stress of parenting alone and the lack of support, her frustration is valid. Also, the boyfriend's actions directly impacted the baby's care and the author's emotional state. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing up for her needs after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and she's setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
