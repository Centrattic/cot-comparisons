My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too many video games, especially after she's explained her feelings multiple times.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. She's been dealing with him prioritizing video games over spending time with her and the baby. She's tried talking to him about it, and even after he agreed, he still played when the baby was in need. She's frustrated and decided to tell him she'll leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo the key points here are communication. She's been expressing her concerns for a couple of years. He agreed to change his behavior, but then didn't follow through. The recent incident where he left to play while the baby was crying seems to be the last straw. She's feeling neglected and not respected, which is affecting her mental health and ability to cope with the baby alone.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective: He might think she's overreacting or picking fights. But from her side, she's given multiple chances and clear boundaries. The fact that he didn't respect those boundaries might indicate a lack of willingness to address her needs, which is a problem in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make an effort to address each other's concerns. If one person consistently dismisses or ignores the other's feelings, especially in matters related to their child's well-being, that's a red flag. The author is setting a boundary here, which is her right. Threatening to leave because of unaddressed issues isn't necessarily wrong; it's about self-respect and the health of the relationship.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she's communicated clearly and he didn't act, then her decision to walk away could be justified. The boyfriend's inaction after agreeing to change might mean he's not willing to put in the effort, which the author has a right to address. So, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
