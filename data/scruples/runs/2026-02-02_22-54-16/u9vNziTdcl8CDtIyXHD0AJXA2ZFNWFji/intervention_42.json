My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, which the author feels is putting their relationship and baby's needs at risk.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman is handling all the baby's care alone, and the boyfriend is spending a lot of time gaming. They've had ongoing arguments about this. Recently, the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was up, leading to the baby puking and the author dealing with it alone. She then confronts him, and he doesn't understand her upset. She tells him she's done and will leave if he continues, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case. So, the answer options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). Let's break it down.\n\nThe woman's perspective: She's overwhelmed, handling the baby alone, and the boyfriend isn't supporting her. The baby needs care, and his gaming is interfering. She's communicated her concerns before, and he still didn't change his behavior. Her ultimatum is because she feels disrespected and unsupported.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective: He might feel that he's handling school and is trying to unwind with games. He didn't see the issue initially and then the situation escalated. He might think she's overreacting, especially since he didn't intend to ignore the baby on purpose.\n\nFrom a relationship advice standpoint, communication is key. The woman has tried to discuss the issue before, but it wasn't resolved. The boyfriend's actions after the agreement (playing during the baby's time) show a lack of follow-through. Her frustration is justified because parental responsibilities are significant, and feeling isolated can be stressful. Her decision to set a boundary by leaving if it continues is a way to prioritize her well-being and the baby's needs.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's standing up for herself after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not her setting a boundary. The ultimatum is a result of his consistent disregard for her feelings and the baby's needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
