My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's in a relationship with a boyfriend who's in school full-time, and they have a four-month-old daughter. She's on maternity leave, so she's the one taking care of the baby all day. The main issue is the boyfriend playing video games a lot, which she's been arguing about for a while. She feels like he prioritizes gaming over their time together and now, with the baby, she's even more frustrated because she's handling everything alone.\n\nThe key incident happened when the baby was hungry, took 10 minutes to eat, and he left to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked, and she had to clean up, change the baby's clothes, etc. When he came back, he didn't understand why she was upset. She told him she was done arguing and that if he keeps doing this, she'll leave.\n\nThe author is asking if she's the asshole (ITA) for threatening to leave if he doesn't stop gaming. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's look at her perspective. She's taking care of a newborn alone all day. That's a significant responsibility. Newborns require constant attention, and it's taxing both physically and emotionally. The boyfriend is in school full-time but is home in the evenings. She's been clear multiple times about how his gaming affects her, even after the baby was born. He agreed to change his behavior but then repeated the same behavior. She's at her breaking point and is using the ultimatum as a way to end the cycle of arguments and what she perceives as disrespect.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's side, he might feel that he's working hard in school and needs some downtime. But the problem is that his downtime is encroaching on the time when he's supposed to be helping with the baby. The issue is not just gaming but the lack of support in parenting and the disregard for her feelings even after he was told it's upsetting. The fact that he didn't understand why she was upset after she explained the situation (the baby puking, her cleaning, etc.) shows a disconnect. He might not realize the emotional and physical toll, or he might be dismissive.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The author's actions are based on her frustration and the cumulative stress of being overwhelmed with the baby without support. She's communicated her feelings, he agreed to change but didn't, and she's setting a boundary. Threatening to leave if he doesn't respect her and help with the baby is a way to enforce that boundary. \n\nIs setting such a boundary unreasonable? It's a personal relationship, and both parties have the right to set limits. If he's not meeting her needs as a partner and co-parent, it's valid for her to decide that she can't continue in that situation. The fact that he doesn't see the issue and isn't responsive to her requests makes her decision more understandable. However, some might argue that a relationship should involve compromise, and maybe she should try another approach before ending it. But given the context of a newborn and the repeated behavior, her breaking point is plausible.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't acting unreasonably. She's been upfront, given chances for him to adjust, and after his failure to do so, she's asserting her needs. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong)."
