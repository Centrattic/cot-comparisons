My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to stop playing video games or else she'll leave him. The situation involves them having a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time while the author is on maternity leave.\n\nThe key points here are the arguments about the boyfriend's gaming habits. She's been frustrated for a while, feeling like she's being put aside. After he agreed to her concerns, he still played when she needed help, leading her to threaten leaving. The question is whether her actions are justified.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of her feelings. She's dealing with the demands of a new baby, which is a lot. The boyfriend's gaming during times when she needs support seems like a major issue. He did agree to stop, but then repeated the behavior, showing a lack of follow-through or consideration. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary and leave if he doesn't change. That's a common approach when someone feels consistently disrespected. The boyfriend's reaction to think she's picking a fight might indicate he doesn't see the issue as she does, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. \n\nI should also consider if there's any fault on her side. She did communicate her needs before, and when he didn't comply, she took action. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibility. Since the baby is a factor, splitting responsibilities is important. If the boyfriend isn't stepping up, her frustration is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs and the well-being of their family, especially after previous agreements. The boyfriend's actions and lack of responsiveness are the main issues here.\n"
