My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author, who's on maternity leave, is handling most of the childcare. They've had ongoing arguments about this. The key incident is when the boyfriend leaves to play games while the baby is crying after puking, leading the author to threaten leaving him if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so maybe he's stressed or using games as a way to unwind. But the author is managing the baby alone, which must be overwhelming. The boyfriend agreed before that excessive gaming was a problem, so his actions might show a lack of follow-through. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation\u2014caring for a baby without help and feeling ignored.\n\nThe boyfriend's response to the author's upset is dismissive; he doesn't understand why she's upset after she told him 5 days ago. That suggests he might not be prioritizing her feelings or the baby's needs. The author's decision to set a firm boundary\u2014leaving if he doesn't stop\u2014could be justified as standing up for herself and her needs.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Maybe she overreacted? However, given the context of repeated issues and the stress of caring for a newborn, her actions seem reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior isn't respecting her limits, so the author's response is about self-respect. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
