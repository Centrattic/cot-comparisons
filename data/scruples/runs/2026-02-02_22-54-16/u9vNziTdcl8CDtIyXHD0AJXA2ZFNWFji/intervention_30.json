My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is causing issues in their relationship, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave.\n\nThe main points are that the couple has been arguing about the gaming habits for a couple of years. The author feels put in a backseat to the games. The boyfriend even said things like, \"if you can find something for us to do, then I'll hang out with you.\" After the baby was born, the author is more frustrated because she's handling everything alone. The boyfriend agreed to change his behavior after being confronted, but then relapsed by playing a 40-minute game while the baby was hungry and later crying. The author told him she's done and might leave if it happens again. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but the author feels he doesn't care or respect her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: he's playing games excessively, even after agreeing to stop. The author has tried to communicate her feelings multiple times, and the boyfriend isn't following through. The incident where the baby puked and the author was alone with the baby while he played seems like a breaking point. The author is handling the baby's needs alone, which is a lot of stress, especially with a newborn.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is dismissive. He doesn't understand why she's upset and thinks she's picking a fight. That's a problem because he's not acknowledging her feelings. The author is justified in feeling disrespected, especially after he agreed to change but didn't. The ultimatum she gave seems a last resort after repeated issues.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend is stressed from school and using games as an escape. But that's not an excuse for neglecting his partner and child. The author is taking on more responsibilities, and the boyfriend isn't supporting her. The fact that he agreed to change but didn't shows a lack of commitment to fixing the problem.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the boyfriend's actions and lack of follow-through are problematic. The author's frustration is valid. The ultimatum is a strong move, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. She's trying to protect her well-being and the relationship's future.\n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014author not in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after repeated issues. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries and the baby's needs. The author's decision to leave isn't the problem here; it's the boyfriend's behavior that's the issue.\n"
