My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is the girlfriend with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. The main issue is that he plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is causing her to take the back burner, especially since she's handling the baby alone.\n\nSo, the key points here: They have a baby, so the responsibilities are high. The boyfriend's gaming habits are a point of contention. The author has been upset about this for a while, and even talked to him about it recently. The recent incident involved him leaving to play during a time when the baby needed attention, leading to the author being upset. She then tells him that if he does it again, she'll leave him. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but the author feels he doesn't respect her or their baby's needs.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). From the description, it seems like the author is frustrated with the lack of support from her partner. After multiple arguments and a recent incident where he ignored her previous warning, she's taking a firm stance. Her argument is that he's not respecting her and their child's needs by playing games when he's home. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's playing to unwind after school, and maybe he thinks he's doing his part. But the author has to handle the baby alone all day. The fact that he agreed last week to avoid such behavior and then repeated it might indicate he's not taking her feelings seriously. The author's decision to set a boundary and walk away if it happens again is a form of self-respect, as she states.\n\nSo, considering that the author has tried to communicate and he hasn't changed despite agreeing to do so, her reaction is about protecting her well-being and the baby's needs. It's a tough situation, but it seems like her actions are justified as a response to his continued disregard. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
