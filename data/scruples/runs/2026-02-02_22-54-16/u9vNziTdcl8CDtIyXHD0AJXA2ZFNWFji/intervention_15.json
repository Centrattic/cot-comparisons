My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who's in school full-time. They have a four-month-old daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is making her take a back seat, especially with the baby. She told him she'd leave if he doesn't stop, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he's busy with classes. The author is on maternity leave, handling the baby alone. The arguments about gaming have been ongoing for a couple of years. The recent incident involved the baby throwing up, and the boyfriend choosing to play a 40-minute game instead of helping. The author confronted him, but he didn't get why she was upset. She then told him this was the last time she'd argue and that she'd leave next time.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has previously expressed her concerns, and the boyfriend didn't change his behavior despite agreeing earlier. His action of leaving to play during the baby's feeding time, which led to a messy situation, seems dismissive. The author feels disrespected and overwhelmed, which is a valid emotion, especially after having a baby. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, both partners need to support each other, especially in parenting responsibilities. If one partner consistently ignores the other's feelings and the needs of the child, that's a problem. The boyfriend's actions here could be seen as not prioritizing the baby and the author's needs. The author setting a boundary and saying she won't tolerate it anymore is a valid response. \n\nHowever, maybe there's more to the boyfriend's side. Being in school might mean he's stressed or using games as a coping mechanism. But the author's point is that after repeated issues and a recent incident that showed no change, she's had enough. The fact that he didn't understand her frustration after she explicitly told him about the problem suggests a lack of empathy or communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend is not willing to adjust his behavior despite clear communication, the author has every right to decide that the relationship isn't working for her. Her decision to leave if he doesn't stop isn't just about the games but about the ongoing disrespect and lack of support. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs and the well-being of their child, and the boyfriend hasn't made necessary changes despite prior warnings.\n"
