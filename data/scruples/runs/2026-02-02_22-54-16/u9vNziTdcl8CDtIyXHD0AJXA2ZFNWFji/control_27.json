My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much, especially since the baby was born. She feels neglected and responsible for all the childcare alone. The key incident here is when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating. The baby pukes, she has to clean up alone, and he doesn't seem to understand why she's upset. She tells him she's leaving if he keeps this up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend might say he's trying to manage school and maybe he's stressed, using games as a coping mechanism. But the author is handling the baby alone all day. The baby's needs are immediate and time-sensitive. If he leaves during a critical time when she's feeding, and then she gets upset because he's not helping, that's a valid concern.\n\nHe agreed before that this behavior was an issue, but he repeated it. The author feels like he doesn't respect her or the baby's needs. Her decision to leave if he doesn't change could be seen as her setting a boundary. But some might argue she's overreacting. However, considering the stress of caring for a newborn alone and previous agreements not to play games during critical times, she's within her rights to enforce that.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of not understanding her upset might indicate a lack of empathy. The author's ultimatum is a response to repeated issues. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's setting boundaries in a situation where her needs and the baby's are not being met. The boyfriend's actions show a pattern of neglecting responsibilities. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
