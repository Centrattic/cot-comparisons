My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time and the writer is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, which the writer feels is causing her to be neglected, especially with the baby's needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer has been dealing with this issue for a couple of years before the baby was born, and it's become more frustrating since the baby's arrival. The boyfriend agreed to stop playing when the baby is awake and needing attention, but then he still does it, leading to the writer threatening to leave.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The boyfriend was informed multiple times about the problem, even agreeing to change his behavior. However, he didn't follow through, which led the writer to take a firm stance. The writer's actions are a response to consistent behavior that she finds disrespectful and harmful to their relationship, especially given the added stress of caring for a newborn alone.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive, not understanding why she's upset after he clearly agreed to the terms. The writer's breaking point is understandable given the circumstances. She's not just being petty; she's standing up for her needs and the well-being of their child. The emotional labor and stress of being a new parent alone can be overwhelming, and the lack of support from her partner exacerbates the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries and the agreed-upon compromise. The writer's response, while drastic, is a legitimate expression of her frustration and a stand for self-respect. People have the right to set limits in relationships, especially when their well-being and that of their child are at stake.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here, and the writer's response is a justified reaction to his continued disregard for her feelings and the situation.\n"
