My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much, especially after the baby was born. The key incident is when the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating, leading to the baby puking, and the author feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is handling all the baby's care alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's gaming habits are causing friction, and there's a history of arguments about this. The last incident seems to be a breaking point. The author set a boundary 5 days prior, and the boyfriend didn't follow it again. The author then said she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the post, it seems she's trying to communicate her needs and boundaries, especially regarding their parenting responsibilities. The boyfriend's actions may indicate a lack of responsiveness to her concerns, which is a valid reason for frustration. However, the author's response is to threaten leaving, which could be seen as a strong move, but given the context of ongoing issues and lack of change, it might be justified.\n\nI need to check if there's any evidence that the author overreacted. The situation with the baby puking and the author handling it alone without support adds to the stress. The boyfriend's failure to follow through on prior agreements might indicate he's dismissive of her feelings, which is a red flag in a relationship. The author's decision to set a firm boundary after repeated issues isn't necessarily wrong, especially when it's about her self-respect and the well-being of their child.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing up for herself and the baby's needs after consistent disregard from the boyfriend. The boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior is the main issue here.\n"
