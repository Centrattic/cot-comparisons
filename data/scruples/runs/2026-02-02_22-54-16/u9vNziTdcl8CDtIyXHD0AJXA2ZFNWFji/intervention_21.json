My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially after he didn't heed her previous warnings despite their daughter being involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The issue is that he's been playing video games excessively, which the author feels is making her take the back burner, especially when she's handling the baby alone. The key incident was when he left to play a 40-minute game right when the baby needed to eat, leading to a mess and the baby crying while he was gaming nearby. The author told him she'd had enough and would leave if he kept doing this, and he thought she was picking a fight.\n\nNow, looking at the dynamics. The author has been trying to communicate her concerns for a couple of years, and even after he agreed to change, he didn't follow through. The recent incident seems like a breaking point, especially with the baby's needs unmet. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is a valid thing to do in a relationship. She's not just reacting to one incident but a pattern of behavior that's been ongoing.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's dealing with school stress and using games as an escape. But the problem is that his actions are affecting the author and their child. The fact that he didn't respect her previous warnings could indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings and the baby's needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding her ground. Since she's standing up for herself and her child's well-being, and the boyfriend hasn't shown willingness to change despite being warned, her response seems justified. Threatening to leave is a strong step, but in the context of a relationship where communication hasn't worked and the behavior is harmful, it's a reasonable decision to prioritize her own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
