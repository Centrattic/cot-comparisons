My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who told her boyfriend that if he continues playing video games too much, she'll leave him. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The woman is on maternity leave and feels she's handling all the childcare alone, leading to frustration. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels he prioritizes games over her and their baby. After a specific incident where he left to play during a critical time when the baby needed attention, she told him she's done and would leave if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate based on the information given.\n\nThe author's arguments: She's handling all the baby's needs alone, he's aware of the issue (they had arguments before), and there was a recent agreement that he shouldn't play during certain times. The incident in question happened when he played while the baby was crying. She felt he didn't respect her or the previous agreement, leading her to set a boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective: He might feel that video games are a way to unwind, especially since he's in school. He might not see the issue the same way, thinking he's contributing in other ways. However, the specific action of leaving during the baby's crying is problematic.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, setting boundaries in a relationship, especially when dealing with childcare responsibilities, is important. The author is expressing her needs and the impact of his actions on her well-being. If he wasn't taking her concerns seriously despite previous discussions, her decision to leave could be seen as a valid self-respect measure. However, some might argue that communication could be improved before taking such a drastic step.\n\nBut considering the context of having a newborn and the stress involved, the author's frustration is understandable. The boyfriend's actions might not be malicious, but the repeated disregard for her feelings and the baby's needs could justify her decision. The key here is whether the author overreacted or if her response was proportionate given the circumstances.\n\nIn similar situations, people often emphasize the importance of mutual respect and compromise. Since the boyfriend didn't respect her prior agreement and the immediate situation involved the baby's care, the author's ultimatum might be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
