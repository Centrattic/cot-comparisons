My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a new baby, where the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected. She told him to stop or she'd leave him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a four-month-old daughter, so the responsibilities are significant. The author is on maternity leave, handling all the baby duties alone. The boyfriend is in school full-time. The conflict is about him playing video games when the baby is awake, leading to her feeling overwhelmed and unsupported.\n\nThe key points are: the author has been arguing about this for years, he agreed to cut down, but then he goes against that agreement, leading her to give an ultimatum. She feels like he doesn't respect her or his responsibilities. He's confused about why she's upset, thinking it's a fight she's picking.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. She's justified in feeling overwhelmed, especially with a newborn. Communication is a two-way street. If he agreed to change but didn't follow through, that's his fault. Her setting boundaries is reasonable. However, maybe she could have handled it differently, but given the circumstances, she's reacting to his repeated inconsiderate behavior. \n\nIs setting an ultimatum wrong? If he's not respecting her needs and she's communicated this clearly, then her decision to leave isn't unreasonable. He's not taking her concerns seriously, so her action is a response to his lack of change. \n\nSo the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because her actions stem from valid concerns and prior agreements not being honored. The boyfriend isn't respecting her or their child's needs, so her decision is justified.\n"
