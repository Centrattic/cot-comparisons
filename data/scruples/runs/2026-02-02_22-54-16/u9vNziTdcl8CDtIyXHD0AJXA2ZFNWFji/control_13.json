My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, which the author feels is causing her to take the back burner, especially since the baby was born.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been arguing about the boyfriend's gaming for a couple of years. After the baby was born, the frustration increased because she's handling everything alone. The boyfriend agreed to the author's concerns less than a week ago, but then relapsed into the same behavior. The specific incident was the baby spilling up, needing care, and the boyfriend playing games despite the author's explicit warning. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, while the author feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is dealing with the challenges of a newborn, which is already a lot of stress. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe his responsibilities are also heavy, but the author is handling the baby alone. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive, even after he agreed to the author's concerns. The author's response is to set a boundary and threaten to leave. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He's not supporting the author with the baby, and he's ignoring her clear boundaries. The author is expressing her needs and the impact of his actions. Setting a boundary and threatening to leave if things don't change is a reasonable response if the other person is not respecting those boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to assess mutual respect and willingness to address issues. The author has tried multiple times, and the boyfriend hasn't followed through. The author is prioritizing her well-being and the relationship's health by stating she can't continue like this. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's addressing a legitimate issue with clear communication and setting boundaries, which is necessary in a relationship.\n"
