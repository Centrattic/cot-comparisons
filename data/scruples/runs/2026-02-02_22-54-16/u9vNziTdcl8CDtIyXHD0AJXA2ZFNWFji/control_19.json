My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time while she's on maternity leave. \n\nFirst, the context: The woman has been frustrated for a couple of years about him prioritizing gaming over spending time with her. After the baby was born, the issue escalated. She had previously confronted him, and he agreed to change. However, he recently ignored her request again, leading her to threaten leaving.\n\nKey points to consider: \n- The couple has a newborn, so responsibilities are high. The woman is handling most of the baby care alone. \n- The boyfriend's actions (playing games when the baby is awake and needing attention) are seen as neglecting his responsibilities, especially after agreeing to change. \n- The woman's frustration is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn without support. \n- He dismissed her feelings when she confronted him again, which might indicate a lack of respect for her concerns.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are a recurring issue, not a one-time mistake. The woman has communicated her boundaries clearly and he hasn't respected them, leading to her decision to end the relationship. In such situations, mutual respect and effort are crucial. If one partner consistently ignores the other's valid concerns, especially regarding child-rearing responsibilities, it's a significant problem.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She's standing up for herself and her needs, which is reasonable. Threatening to leave when boundaries are disrespected isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The woman isn't being unreasonable; she's seeking a partner who respects her and shares responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
