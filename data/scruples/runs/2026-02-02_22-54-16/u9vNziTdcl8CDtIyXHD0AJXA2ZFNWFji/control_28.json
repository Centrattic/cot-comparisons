My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments for years about him playing video games too much, especially since the baby was born.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author feels she's taking a backseat to his gaming. She mentions that he gives her a conditional offer to hang out, which she finds dismissive. After the baby was born, she's even more upset because she's handling everything alone, and he comes home and plays for hours. There was a recent incident where he left her alone with the baby, who puked and needed attention, and he was gaming during that. She told him she's done and will leave if he keeps doing this, and now he's calling her out for being in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is supposed to be a partner in parenting. If he's in school, maybe he's busy, but the author is handling the baby alone all day. The fact that he ignores her explicit warning (five days ago) shows he's not respecting her boundaries. The incident described is a clear example of him prioritizing games over helping with the baby, leading to a stressful situation for the author.\n\nIn relationships, especially with a newborn, teamwork is crucial. If one partner is consistently not pulling their weight and not respecting the other's feelings after clear communication, that's a problem. The author is setting a boundary, which is her right. She's not attacking him without reason; she's been trying to address this for years and now is at the breaking point. The boyfriend's response that he doesn't understand why she's upset suggests he's not empathizing with her situation. \n\nIs she overreacting? She's been building up frustration for a long time, and this incident was the last straw. Her threat to leave because she doesn't respect herself enough to stay in a disrespectful relationship seems justified. Unless the boyfriend was genuinely unaware and there's a misunderstanding, but the author said he agreed before, so this was a violation. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole. The boyfriend isn't respecting her needs and boundaries, so the answer should be B.\n"
