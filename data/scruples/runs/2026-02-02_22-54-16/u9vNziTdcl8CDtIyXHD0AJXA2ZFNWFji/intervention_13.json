My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her boyfriend about his video game habits after he ignored their previous agreement. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing too many video games. The author feels neglected and is frustrated because she's handling all the baby care alone, and he's playing games when he gets home. \n\nShe mentioned that they had a recent conversation where he agreed to change his behavior. However, he then proceeded to play a 40-minute game while the baby was up, leading to a mess and her having to deal with it alone. The author told him she's had enough and that she'd leave next time if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the context: the baby is young and needs constant attention. The author is on maternity leave, so she's likely dealing with the demands of a newborn without much help. Her frustration is understandable. The boyfriend, despite agreeing to change, went ahead with the same behavior. That shows a lack of follow-through. \n\nThe author's response was to set a clear boundary. She's not just upset about the games but about the lack of respect and consideration for her feelings and the baby's needs. Her statement about leaving if he doesn't change is a firm boundary, which is reasonable in a relationship where mutual respect is expected.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction being dismissive (\"doesn't understand why she's upset\") suggests he isn't acknowledging her valid concerns. The author's actions are about self-respect and the health of the relationship. She's not being unreasonable; she's standing up for her needs after repeated issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not her response to it. Her decision to set a boundary is justified given the circumstances and his failure to meet previous agreements. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
