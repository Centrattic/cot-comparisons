My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's on maternity leave, is taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone while her boyfriend, who's in school full-time, is playing video games a lot. They've been arguing about this for a couple of years, and since the baby was born, it's gotten worse. The key incident is when the baby needs to eat, which takes 10 minutes, and he leaves to play a 40-minute game. The baby pukes, and the author has to deal with it alone, and when she gets back, he's still playing. She tells him she's done and that if he does it again, she'll leave. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is overwhelmed with taking care of the baby alone. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he's busy, but he's not working. The baby is only four months old, so the demands on the caregiver are high. The author has already given him a clear warning a week before, specifying when it's acceptable and when it's not. The boyfriend broke that agreement by playing during a time when the baby needed attention. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is dismissive; he doesn't understand why she's upset and thinks she's picking a fight. That's a problem because he's not acknowledging her feelings or the importance she places on shared responsibility. The author is standing up for herself, setting a boundary, and following through when he disrespects it. \n\nIs it fair for her to leave over this? Well, the argument is about respect and communication. If he's not willing to adjust his behavior despite clear communication, then maybe she's justified in taking a hard stance. The baby's care is a shared responsibility, and he's not contributing equally. The author is under a lot of stress, and his actions are adding to her stress without considering her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend isn't intentionally ignoring her. He might not realize the impact of his actions. But the author has already told him multiple times, and he still does it. That suggests a pattern of behavior that doesn't respect her needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to communicate her needs and is taking a stand when those needs aren't met. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not her response.\n"
