My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits. The situation involves them having a four-month-old daughter, with the boyfriend in school and the author on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the author mentions ongoing issues with the boyfriend prioritizing gaming over spending time with her, especially after the baby's birth. She's been arguing about this for a couple of years, but since the baby, it's gotten worse. The boyfriend agreed to stop playing when the baby was awake, but then he breaks that agreement again by playing during feeding time, leading to the baby puking and her having to handle everything alone. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, the author is handling most responsibilities alone, the boyfriend agreed to change his behavior but didn't follow through. The author feels disrespected and decides to end the relationship if it continues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend's actions are affecting both the author and the baby. The author is under a lot of stress from caring for a newborn alone. The boyfriend's refusal to follow through on his commitment shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and their child's needs. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is a reasonable response. Threatening to leave when there's a history of broken promises could be justified as self-respect and setting a limit. The boyfriend's reaction, thinking she's picking a fight, might stem from not recognizing the severity of his actions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems she's standing up for herself after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the root problem, not her response. Therefore, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
