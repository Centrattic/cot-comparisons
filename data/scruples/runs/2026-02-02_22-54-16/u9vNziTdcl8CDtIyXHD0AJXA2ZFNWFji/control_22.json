My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games too much.\n\nThe key points from the story: The author has been frustrated for a couple of years that her boyfriend prioritizes gaming over spending time with her. After the baby was born, she felt more overwhelmed because she's handling everything alone, and he comes home and plays games. Recently, he agreed with her that this behavior was inappropriate. But then, when the baby needed attention, he left to play a game for 40 minutes, leading to her getting upset because the baby cried while he was gaming. She told him she's done and would leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe author is asking if she's the asshole for threatening to leave. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in the situation. The boyfriend is in school, but he's also part of a relationship with a new baby. The author is on maternity leave, which is a time that's supposed to be supported by the partner. The baby is only four months old, so parental responsibilities are significant. The boyfriend's gaming is interfering with shared parenting duties. \n\nHe agreed that his behavior was a problem, but then repeated it. The author is the one who is taking care of the baby alone, which can be very stressful. The scenario where the baby puked and the author had to handle it alone while he played seems to exacerbate the issue. \n\nThe author's response was to tell him she's leaving if he doesn't stop. Is this overreacting? Well, she's been dealing with this for a while, and he's not respecting her boundaries even after agreeing to change. The ultimatum might be a reflection of her frustration and feeling unsupported. \n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being too harsh, but given the context of ongoing issues and specific incidents, his not taking her concerns seriously is a problem. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. Threatening to leave in response to a lack of respect and continued behavior that affects their child's care isn't necessarily the wrong move. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are in response to a partner who hasn't respected her or their child's needs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
