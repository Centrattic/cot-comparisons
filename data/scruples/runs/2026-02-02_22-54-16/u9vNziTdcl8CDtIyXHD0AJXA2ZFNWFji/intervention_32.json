My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person sharing the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially with a newborn. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The author mentions that the boyfriend often prioritizes gaming over spending time with her, even after agreeing to change his behavior. The specific incident in question involves the boyfriend leaving to play a 40-minute game while the baby is hungry, leading to the baby puking and the author handling everything alone. The author then tells her boyfriend she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author is taking care of the baby alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's action here seems dismissive of her needs and the baby's, especially after they had previously discussed the issue. The author is setting a boundary that she can't keep arguing and that she expects respect. The boyfriend not following through on his agreement from five days ago might indicate a pattern of not respecting her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect, and boundaries. The author has tried to address the issue before, and the boyfriend's response in the recent incident shows a lack of consideration. The author is asserting her needs, which is a valid and healthy boundary, especially in a relationship where there's a lot of stress from caring for a newborn. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's \"picking a fight\" suggests he's not acknowledging her valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), the situation seems more like the boyfriend isn't respecting the author's feelings and needs, which the author is now standing up for. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's setting a boundary after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, so the author isn't the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
