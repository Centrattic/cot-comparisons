My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend is spending a lot of time playing video games, which the author is frustrated with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is on maternity leave, taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone, while the boyfriend is in school full-time. They've had arguments about him gaming too much, and after a specific incident where he plays while the baby is crying, she tells him she's leaving if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she feels disrespected.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, maybe she should have communicated better before threatening to leave. But then again, they had already discussed the issue and he agreed to change his behavior. The incident happened again, maybe he didn't realize the severity. The author was taking care of the baby alone, which adds stress. Threatening to leave isn't just about the games but about feeling unappreciated and overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be under pressure from school, and maybe the author could have asked for more help with the baby. But he chose to play games when the baby was crying, which seems neglectful. The author's frustration is justified, especially after prior agreements. Threatening to leave is a strong move, but given the circumstances and his lack of change, maybe it's understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
