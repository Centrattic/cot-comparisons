My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games despite previous arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years, and since the baby was born, the author feels more frustrated because she's handling everything alone. The key incident happened when the baby needed feeding, and he left to play for 40 minutes, leading to the baby puking and the author having to deal with it all alone. She had already warned him five days earlier that playing during non-nap times would upset her, but he still did it. She then threatened to leave him if he continued.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author is dealing with the full burden of childcare, which is a significant stressor. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive of her feelings and the practical needs of the baby. The fact that he agreed to the previous warning and still repeated the behavior suggests he either didn't take it seriously or didn't understand the gravity. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with a newborn, where even minor incidents can become major stress points.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he's in school and might be using gaming as a way to unwind after a long day. However, the timing of his gaming\u2014right when the baby needs attention\u2014shows a lack of consideration for her and the baby's needs. The author's decision to set a firm boundary is a response to ongoing issues, not just a single instance. She's trying to prioritize her well-being and the relationship's health, which is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect and communication. The author has made her feelings clear multiple times, and the boyfriend's actions have not changed. The author's threat to leave is a last resort after repeated failures to address the issue. This isn't about being in the wrong necessarily, but about whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. Since the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries and the situation is affecting the child, the author's stance seems justified. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
