My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is with a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The author is on maternity leave and has been dealing with the boyfriend prioritizing gaming over spending time with her and the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they've been arguing about the gaming for a couple of years. She feels like she's taking a back seat to his gaming, and he even said things like, \"find something for us to do\" otherwise he'll play. That seems dismissive of her feelings. After the baby was born, the situation escalated. She confronted him about it, and he agreed to change. However, after an incident where he left to play while the baby was crying, she told him she's done and would leave if he continued.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend's actions: he's neglecting the baby and his partner, even after agreeing to change. The author is trying to set boundaries because she's stressed from taking care of the baby alone. The incident described is a specific example where he didn't follow through on his agreement. She's standing up for herself, which is valid given the circumstances.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective might be that he's in school and stressed, using games as a way to unwind. But the author has legitimate reasons to be upset\u2014she's handling all the baby's needs alone, and his actions show disregard for her and the child. The fact that he agreed to change but didn't follow through shows a lack of respect for her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't follow through. His response to her being upset was not understanding, which is a problem. The author's decision to set a firm boundary and walk away if the behavior continues is her right, especially when it's affecting her well-being and their child's care.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to protect her emotional health and the baby's well-being. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
