My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author's boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which is causing conflict, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The author has been upset about this for a while and finally told her boyfriend that if he doesn't stop, she'll leave him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they've been arguing about this for a couple of years. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. After the baby was born, the issue became more frustrating. She told him weeks ago that playing during certain times was okay, but other times it made her mad. Then, when he played for 40 minutes while the baby was crying, she told him she was done and that she'd leave if he did it again. He thought she was picking a fight, but she felt he didn't respect her.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author tried to set a boundary weeks ago, and the boyfriend didn't adhere to it. The situation escalated when he played during a time when the baby needed attention. The author felt alone and overwhelmed, and finally told him she was leaving if he didn't change. \n\nI need to assess if her reaction was justified. She's handling a newborn alone, and the boyfriend isn't supporting her. His actions seem dismissive of her feelings and the baby's needs. The author is at her breaking point, which is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn and the lack of support. \n\nHowever, maybe the boyfriend has his own perspective. Perhaps he's under academic stress, and gaming is his way to unwind. But he agreed to her previous concerns and still didn't follow through. His response after the incident was not empathetic, which suggests he might not be taking her feelings seriously. \n\nThe author's decision to set a firm boundary and leave if things don't change isn't unreasonable. She's prioritizing her well-being and the relationship's future. The boyfriend's dismissal of her feelings could be a red flag. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's common for partners to support each other, especially during challenging times like caring for a newborn. The boyfriend's behavior might be neglecting his responsibilities as a partner. The author is holding him accountable, which is a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her needs, saw no change, and decided to leave the relationship if it continued. Her actions are a response to his lack of respect and support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
