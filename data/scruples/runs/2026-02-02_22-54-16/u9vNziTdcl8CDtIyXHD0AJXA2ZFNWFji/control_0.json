My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who's upset with her boyfriend for playing too much video games, especially since they have a newborn. She told him to stop or she'd leave. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The couple has a four-month-old daughter, so childcare is a big deal. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. That means she's probably handling more of the baby's needs during the day. They've been having this issue for a couple of years, but it's gotten worse since the baby was born. \n\nThe key incident is the day the baby puked on her, and the boyfriend was playing games instead of helping. The author had already warned him about playing when the baby isn't sleeping, and he did it anyway. She told him she's done and will leave if he does it again. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The arguments for her not being in the wrong: she's dealing with a newborn, which is exhausting. She's given multiple chances to address the issue, and he didn't change his behavior despite agreeing to it. She's setting boundaries because his actions are affecting her well-being and their relationship. \n\nArguments that might suggest she's in the wrong: Maybe she's being too harsh? But considering the stress of a newborn and the previous warnings, it's about respect and communication. The boyfriend didn't take her concerns seriously even after agreeing. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is dismissive, not understanding why she's upset. That lack of empathy could be a red flag. The author is seeking respect and partnership, which are valid needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't the asshole. She's standing up for herself in a stressful situation where her partner isn't meeting her needs. Answer B.\n"
