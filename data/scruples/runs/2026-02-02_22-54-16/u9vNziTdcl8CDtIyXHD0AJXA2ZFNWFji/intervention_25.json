My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habit, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nSo the situation is: the boyfriend is in school full-time, the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing games a lot. The author feels neglected and that he's prioritizing games over her and the baby. Recently, she told him she's had enough and if he doesn't stop, she's leaving. He sees it as a fight, while she feels he doesn't respect her or their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is very young, and the author is handling all the care alone. The boyfriend plays games while the baby is awake and fussing, which the author finds inconsiderate. She had a prior conversation where he agreed to change, but then he didn't follow through. She's standing her ground now, which can be seen as justified because she's setting a boundary after a previous agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be stressed from school and using games as a coping mechanism. But he's also a parent, so the responsibility to be present for the baby is important. The author is trying to communicate her needs and the importance of shared parenting. If he's not respecting that, it's a valid reason to consider the relationship's future.\n\nThe key points are the repeated arguments, the prior agreement he broke, and the author's decision to set a firm boundary. The boyfriend's reaction to not understanding her upset could indicate a lack of empathy. The author isn't just being emotional; she's addressing a pattern of behavior that's affecting their family dynamic.\n\nI think the author is justified in her actions. She's communicated her concerns, he didn't follow through, and she's making a decision based on her own respect and the well-being of their child. The boyfriend is in a position where he needs to reassess his priorities. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
