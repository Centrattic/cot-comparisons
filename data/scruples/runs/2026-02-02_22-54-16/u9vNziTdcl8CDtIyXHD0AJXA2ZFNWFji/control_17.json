My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: They have a newborn, the boyfriend is a full-time student, and the author is on maternity leave. The problem is the boyfriend's excessive gaming, which the author feels is neglecting their relationship and responsibilities. The key points are the history of arguments, recent incidents where the boyfriend ignored her concerns, and the final straw leading to the threat of leaving.\n\nThe author feels that the boyfriend isn't respecting her or their child's needs. He agreed previously to change his behavior but failed to do so again. The situation with the baby puking and her crying while he was gaming is a significant trigger. The author's response was to tell him she's done, which is a serious decision.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The boyfriend is in school, which might mean he has a heavy workload, but the author is handling the baby alone. The balance of responsibilities is crucial here. The boyfriend's actions seem to dismiss her emotional and physical burden, which can't be healthy for the relationship. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, threatening to leave after clear agreements and repeated failures to meet expectations might be justified. The boyfriend's lack of empathy or understanding is a red flag. The author is prioritizing her self-respect and the well-being of the relationship. While it's a tough situation, her decision to set a firm boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's failure to respect her boundaries is a bigger issue here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to chronic neglect and broken promises, and she's taking a stand for her own worth and their relationship's health.\n"
