My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games when they've argued about it, especially with their four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, handling the baby alone. They've had ongoing issues about him prioritizing gaming over spending time with her. The latest incident is that after the baby's feeding time, he left to play a game for 40 minutes, during which the baby puked, and the author had to manage everything alone. He didn't understand her upset when she told him. After he finished, the author said she was done and would leave if he continued.\n\nThe author's main points are that she's been upset for a long time, he agreed to change but hasn't, and this latest incident shows he doesn't respect her or care about her feelings. She's asserting her right to leave a relationship where she feels disrespected.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it fair for her to set boundaries about his gaming? Does he have a legitimate need to play video games as a stress relief, especially while in school? How does the division of labor in the relationship affect this? The author is doing all the baby care, which is a lot. The boyfriend might not recognize the emotional labor she's doing.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is mutual respect and communication. The author has tried to communicate her feelings multiple times, and the boyfriend didn't follow through. The author is standing up for her needs, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's not taking her seriously and not making the necessary adjustments when the child is involved could be a red flag.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't being unreasonable. She's setting a boundary after repeated issues. The boyfriend's actions (ignoring agreed-upon boundaries) are problematic. The author's decision to leave if the behavior continues is her right. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key is that the author is addressing a legitimate issue that affects their relationship and well-being.\n"
