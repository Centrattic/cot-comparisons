My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've been arguing over the frequency of his gaming for a couple of years. He used to say things like, \"if you can find something for us to do, then I'll hang out with you,\" which sounds dismissive. After the baby was born, the author feels even more frustrated because she's handling all the baby care alone, and he plays games when he gets home. \n\nThe key event here is when the baby pukes on the author and herself, and the boyfriend goes to play a game for 40 minutes. The author then has to clean up by herself while he's away. After that, she tells him she's had enough and threatens to leave if he doesn't stop. He doesn't get why she's upset, and she leaves. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. Let's break it down. The boyfriend's actions: he agreed to stop gaming during certain times but didn't follow through. The author tried to communicate her needs, and when he didn't respect that, she sets a boundary. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author expressed her feelings and set a clear boundary after a prior agreement. The boyfriend didn't adhere to that, which might indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries. The author's frustration is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like giving him another chance or seeking couples' counseling. However, in cases where a partner consistently disregards the other's feelings, especially in a high-stress situation like caring for a newborn, taking a strong stance can be valid for self-respect. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he doesn't see the issue, which is problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship is a response to ongoing disrespect and lack of cooperation. It's about self-respect and the well-being in a partnership. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions leading up to this point show a pattern of not respecting her needs and boundaries. Her response is a justified self-defense after repeated issues. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
