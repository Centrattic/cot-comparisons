My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, especially after the baby was born. The author feels neglected and has been trying to address the issue but is frustrated because the boyfriend doesn't change his behavior, even after agreeing to do so. The latest incident led the author to tell him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one taking care of the baby alone all day. The boyfriend comes home and plays games, even when the baby needs attention. The author had previously warned him, but he didn't follow through. The key points are the impact on the relationship, the well-being of the baby, and mutual respect.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as self-centered, especially since he's in school but should also be contributing to parenting. The author is feeling unappreciated and overburdened. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship. The fact that the author has communicated her feelings multiple times and the boyfriend hasn't changed suggests a lack of consideration. The author's decision to leave if the behavior continues is about her self-respect and the health of the relationship.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the boyfriend feels stressed from school and uses gaming as a coping mechanism. But the author's needs as a parent and partner should be a priority. The baby's needs are immediate, so the boyfriend's choice to play games during that time is problematic. The author isn't being unreasonable in expecting support, especially with the added stress of a newborn.\n\nThe argument is about how to handle the situation. The author is at her breaking point, and her reaction is a culmination of ongoing issues. She's given multiple chances, and the boyfriend hasn't made an effort to adjust. In such cases, making a firm decision to leave might be a last resort to protect her own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a result of the boyfriend's consistent disregard for her feelings and the baby's needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
