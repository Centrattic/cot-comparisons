My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the person posting is on maternity leave. The main issue is about the boyfriend playing video games excessively, even after being told it's causing distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person (let's assume they're the woman in this case) is handling a newborn alone all day. The boyfriend comes home and prioritizes gaming over helping. There was a prior agreement that he would avoid gaming while the baby is up. But he breaks that agreement again, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the cumulative stress from the baby's needs, the previous arguments, and the latest incident where the boyfriend ignores her request. She tells him she'll leave if he continues this behavior. He thinks she's being unreasonable. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, setting boundaries is important. The woman has communicated her needs clearly before. When the boyfriend doesn't respect those boundaries, it's valid to feel disrespected. The fact that he's in school might mean he has responsibilities, but so does she with the baby. The balance here seems off, especially since he's not helping with childcare. \n\nThe question is whether her ultimatum is justified. She's been trying to address the issue multiple times, and this is the final straw. Her emotional response is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone. The boyfriend's lack of action after agreeing to change suggests he either isn't taking her concerns seriously or isn't capable of making adjustments. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and effort. If one partner repeatedly ignores the other's needs despite communication, it's reasonable to consider the relationship's viability. The woman isn't the one in the wrong for setting a boundary after being disrespected. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. So the answer should be B, meaning she's not the asshole.\n"
