My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a newborn.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They\u2019ve been arguing about his gaming for a couple of years. The main issue is that he prioritizes gaming over spending time with her and their daughter. After a recent incident where he played games while the baby cried, she told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are the ongoing nature of the conflict and the recent example. The author has communicated her concerns before, and he didn't change his behavior despite agreeing that it's inappropriate. The situation with the baby puking and crying while he played is a significant stressor. She's under a lot of pressure as a new mom, and his lack of support is adding to her frustration.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, not understanding why she's upset after she already told him, suggests he's dismissive of her feelings. The author's decision to set a clear boundary and walk away if the behavior continues is her way of protecting her own well-being. In a relationship, especially with a child, mutual support is crucial. If one partner repeatedly ignores the other's valid concerns, it's understandable that the other might feel they're not being respected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to a pattern of neglect and disrespect, and she's setting necessary boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
