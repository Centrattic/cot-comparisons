My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a newborn baby, and the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which is causing conflict. The woman is upset because he's not helping with the baby and is instead gaming. She told him she'd leave if he doesn't stop, and now the question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've been arguing about the gaming for a couple of years, but it's gotten worse since the baby was born. The key incident was when the baby needed care, he left to play, and the woman ended up dealing with the mess alone. She told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's overreacting.\n\nFrom the woman's perspective, she's handling the baby alone all day, and her partner isn't stepping up. She's clearly frustrated and feels disrespected. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might think he's contributing in his own way, but his actions don't align with her needs. The fact that he agreed to the problem before but then repeated the same behavior suggests he either doesn't take her concerns seriously or can't manage his time well.\n\nThe woman is setting a boundary, which is her right. If he's not respecting her needs, especially regarding childcare, then her decision to leave could be justified. The community often sympathizes with the parent trying to set boundaries for the family's well-being. The boyfriend's gaming is affecting the household responsibilities, and she's trying to make him aware that it's not acceptable.\n\nBut wait, is there a middle ground? Maybe she could have communicated better or sought a compromise. However, she did try to talk to him before, and he didn't change. Now, after another incident, she's taking a firm stance. Her actions are a response to his inaction, so she's not in the wrong for protecting her own well-being and the baby's needs.\n\nAlso, considering the context of new parenthood, stress is high. Her frustration is valid. The boyfriend's lack of response to her previous warnings might make her justified in taking the next step. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
