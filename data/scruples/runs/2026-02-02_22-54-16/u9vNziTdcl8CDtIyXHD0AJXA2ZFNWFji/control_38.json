My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the writer is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby's care alone. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays too much video games, even after the writer has tried to address it.\n\nSo, the setup is that they've been arguing for a couple of years about the frequency of his gaming. The writer feels she's taking a back seat. He even told her he'd play unless she found something for them to do together. After the baby was born, the problem worsened. The writer confronted him about it a week before the incident, and he agreed. Then, in the latest incident, the baby needed to eat, and while she was eating (which took 10 minutes), he went to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked on them, and the writer had to clean up alone, then go get clothes, and when she returned, the baby was crying, and he was still gaming. She told him she was done arguing and would leave the next time he did this.\n\nHe thinks she's picking a fight. She argues that she gave a clear warning, and he ignored it, showing disrespect. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her reaction is justified. She's dealing with a newborn alone, which is exhausting and stressful. The boyfriend is supposed to be helping but is instead gaming. Even after multiple arguments and a recent agreement, he still does it. She's reaching her breaking point. Her ultimatum is about respecting herself and ending the relationship if he doesn't change. He's dismissing her feelings as picking a fight.\n\nFrom her perspective, he's not meeting his responsibilities as a partner, especially with a new baby. The baby's needs are constant, and she's handling everything alone. His gaming during a critical time (when the baby was eating and later crying) shows a lack of support. She's trying to communicate her needs, and he's not responding appropriately.\n\nHe might see it as a harmless game, but in reality, it's a sign of neglecting his responsibilities. The fact that he agreed to change a week before but still did it again suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. The writer's decision to leave is a reaction to his continued behavior despite her clear boundaries. In relationships, when one person repeatedly ignores the other's feelings and agreed-upon boundaries, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that she's \"picking a fight\" seems dismissive. He's not acknowledging her valid emotional response to being overwhelmed and unsupported. The author isn't just being petty; she's addressing a serious issue of partnership and shared responsibilities, especially in the context of parenting. The ultimatum is a last resort after repeated failures to resolve the problem.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to ongoing neglect and a failure to meet the basic expectations of partnership and co-parenting. So the answer should be B.\n"
