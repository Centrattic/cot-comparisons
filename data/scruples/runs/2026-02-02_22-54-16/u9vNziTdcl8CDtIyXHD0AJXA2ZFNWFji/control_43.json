My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that he plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is making her take the back seat, especially since she's handling the baby alone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. After the baby's birth, it's gotten worse. She's been taking care of the baby all day, and when he comes home, he plays games, even after she expressed that it's upsetting her. The specific incident in question is when the baby puked, she had to clean up alone while he played. She told him she was done and would leave if he didn't stop, and now he's saying she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for telling him she'll leave if he doesn't stop. To determine this, I should consider if her actions are justified. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby; he's choosing to play games instead. The author has communicated her feelings multiple times, including recently. He didn't change his behavior despite her clear warnings, which shows a lack of responsiveness to her needs. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and responsibility. The author has tried to address the issue multiple times, and the boyfriend hasn't made an effort to change. As a new parent, she's under a lot of stress and needs support. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive, not taking his parental responsibilities seriously. \n\nSetting a boundary and stating the consequences if they aren't respected is reasonable. Walking away from a relationship where one's needs and the child's well-being aren't prioritized isn't necessarily the wrong choice. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight suggests he's not acknowledging her valid concerns, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and her child's needs after repeated attempts to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
