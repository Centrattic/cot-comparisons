My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, causing conflict, especially with the author feeling neglected and overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternal leave, handling the baby alone. The key issue is the boyfriend's gaming habits. The author has expressed her concerns before, and even though he agreed to change, he didn't follow through. The recent incident where he left to play while the baby was crying seems like a breaking point. The author then tells him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he's in school, so maybe he's stressed or needs an outlet. But the author is the primary caregiver, dealing with the baby's needs alone. The conflict arises from the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries despite prior warnings. The author's ultimatum is a response to repeated behavior that's affecting their relationship and family life.\n\nI should consider if the author overreacted. She's under a lot of stress with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't contributing as expected. The fact that he agreed to change before but didn't might show a lack of commitment to resolving the issue. The author's decision to end the relationship is a result of feeling unrespected and neglected. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication breakdown. Did the boyfriend have a chance to explain his actions? The author might be using an ultimatum without giving him another chance. But given the context\u2014newborn, previous agreements not followed\u2014it's understandable she's at her limit. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, relationships require mutual respect and effort. If one partner consistently dismisses the other's feelings, it's a red flag. The author's decision, while harsh, is a response to ongoing issues. So, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
