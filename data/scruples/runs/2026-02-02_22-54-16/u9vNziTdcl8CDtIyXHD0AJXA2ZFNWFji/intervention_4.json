My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the writer is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much, especially when he's home. \n\nSo the main points here: The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, the author feels neglected, especially after the baby was born. The boyfriend agreed to stop playing during certain times, but then he went ahead and played while the baby was crying. The author confronted him, and now she's told him she'll leave if he keeps doing it. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nHmm. The author is on maternity leave, so she's handling most of the baby's care. The boyfriend is in school, but he's not contributing as much as she'd like. The key incident was when the baby was crying and needed attention, but he was gaming. The author feels that despite previous agreements, he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree. In AITA questions, the community usually looks at both sides. The boyfriend's perspective is that maybe he's stressed from school and uses gaming as a coping mechanism. But the author is doing all the parenting work alone and feels he's not supportive. \n\nThe boyfriend agreed to the previous agreement, then broke it. That shows a lack of follow-through. The author's frustration is valid, especially with the baby's needs. The author's ultimatum seems like a response to repeated issues. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's justified in feeling upset. The boyfriend isn't meeting his responsibilities as a partner post-birth. The fact that he's in school doesn't absolve him from contributing. The author's actions are a reaction to his continued behavior despite prior warnings. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author is standing up for herself and her needs, which is reasonable. She's given multiple chances, and the boyfriend hasn't followed through. Her decision to set a clear boundary is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
