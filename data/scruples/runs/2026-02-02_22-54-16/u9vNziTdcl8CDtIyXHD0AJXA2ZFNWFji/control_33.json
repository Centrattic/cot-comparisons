My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for telling her boyfriend she'll leave if he doesn't stop playing video games, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing issues with him gaming too much, which the author feels makes her take the back burner. The problem escalates after the baby is born, and recently, he leaves her alone with the baby to play a 40-minute game. The baby pukes, and the author is left to handle the mess and crying alone. She confronts him, and he doesn't understand why she's upset. She then threatens to leave if he doesn't change his behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated arguments about his gaming affecting their relationship and parental responsibilities. The author has communicated her concerns multiple times, including a recent agreement that he wouldn't game during certain times. Despite this, he still plays when he shouldn't, and when confronted, he's dismissive. The author feels disrespected and unvalued in the relationship, leading her to set a boundary that if he continues, she'll leave.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important, especially when there's a child involved. His actions are affecting both their daughter and their partnership. The author is taking responsibility for the baby alone, and his gaming is seen as neglecting shared responsibilities. The boyfriend, however, might feel that the author is overreacting or not giving him enough space to unwind, especially while in school.\n\nBut the situation shows a pattern of behavior where the author's concerns are not being addressed. The final incident seems like a breaking point, where his actions directly caused stress and extra work for her. Her response is a firm boundary, which is a common way people set limits in relationships when other methods fail. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction not understanding her upset suggests a lack of empathy or awareness of the impact of his actions. The author feels she's respected his needs before but now feels neglected. In such cases, threatening to leave if the behavior doesn't change isn't necessarily wrong, especially when it's a direct consequence of repeated issues and lack of progress.\n\nHowever, some might argue that threatening to leave is extreme, but given the context of parental responsibilities and the history, it's a valid response. The key is whether the author's actions are a reasonable reaction to ongoing neglect and disrespect. Since the boyfriend didn't heed prior warnings and dismissed her feelings, the author's decision to set a clear boundary is justified.\n"
