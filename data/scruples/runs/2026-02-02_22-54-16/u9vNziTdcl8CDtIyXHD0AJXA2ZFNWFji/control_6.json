My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend playing a lot of video games, which is causing conflict.\n\nThe author is the girlfriend, who's on maternity leave, taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone. The boyfriend is in school full time. They've had arguments about his gaming habits for a couple of years. Recently, after a specific incident where he left to play while the baby was up and crying, she told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the baby needs constant care, the girlfriend is handling it alone, the boyfriend is coming home and playing games instead of helping, even after agreeing to stop. The recent incident where he left during the baby's feeding time and she had to deal with a mess alone, and when she confronts him, he doesn't understand her anger. She then tells him she's done and will leave if he does it again.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's actions are clearly not helping with the baby's needs and are dismissive of her feelings. He agreed to change his behavior but didn't follow through. The girlfriend is acting out of frustration and a need for respect and support. She's setting a boundary after repeated issues, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of empathy and understanding here is problematic. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
