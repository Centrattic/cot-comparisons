      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions their family's culture of not cleaning up in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them, but the author argues that there are cleaners, movie theaters have limited capacity now, and the cost of going to the theater is high. They're trying to figure out if they're an asshole for not cleaning up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, especially in shared spaces. Movie theaters, like other public venues, rely on staff to clean up, but that doesn't mean patrons should leave messes. It adds extra work for employees and can create an unpleasant environment for others.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the idea that theaters now seat around 30 people, implying it's not a big task. But even in smaller theaters, leaving trash isn't acceptable. The cost of the ticket doesn't justify not cleaning up. The argument about cleaners might be a bit of a stretch because while there are cleaners, the expectation is that people should take responsibility for their own waste. Plus, the author's friend is part of the social contract where people are expected to be considerate.\n\nThe cultural aspect mentioned by the author is interesting. If their family's norm is to leave trash, that's a possible reason, but societal norms generally expect people to clean up. Just because someone was raised a certain way doesn't excuse behavior that's against the majority's expectations. The author acknowledges that their friend chastised them, indicating that there's a social expectation they're not meeting.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the line is thin. If the author is consistently leaving trash in public places, they might come across as inconsiderate. However, if it's a one-time thing and they're aware of it, maybe not. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The author's justification doesn't hold up because the expectation is to clean up, regardless of the venue's cleaning staff or cost. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They should have thrown away their trash, even if others clean up eventually. It's a matter of personal responsibility and consideration for others.\n"
