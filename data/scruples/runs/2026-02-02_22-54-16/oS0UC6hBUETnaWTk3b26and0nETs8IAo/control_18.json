But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The writer mentions they were raised in a culture where they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls, stadiums, or theaters. Their friend scolded them after a movie, but the writer argues that movie theaters have cleaning staff and that it's expensive to go to the theater, so maybe it's not their responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In most public places, especially in the US, it's generally expected that individuals dispose of their own trash. Leaving trash behind is considered inconsiderate and adds to the burden of staff. The writer's reasoning about cleaning staff is a common argument, but the presence of staff doesn't negate the expectation for patrons to clean up. Theaters charge for entry, which includes the cost of maintaining the space, so expecting others to clean up one's mess could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe writer's upbringing is a factor, but cultural differences don't excuse behavior that's widely seen as inappropriate. The friend's reaction suggests that this is a point of contention, and the writer is now questioning their actions. Even if the theater isn't overwhelmingly crowded, leaving trash behind is still a matter of basic etiquette. The cost of the movie ticket includes the experience, which includes a clean environment for others. \n\nThe writer's justification that there are people to clean might be valid in a different context, but in a public space where everyone is expected to contribute to cleanliness, it's reasonable to expect individuals to dispose of their trash. The writer's admission that they threw it away after being scolded shows they recognize the social expectation, even if they're conflicted about it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's background explains their behavior, it doesn't excuse it. The general consensus is that leaving trash in public places is inconsiderate, so the writer is in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
