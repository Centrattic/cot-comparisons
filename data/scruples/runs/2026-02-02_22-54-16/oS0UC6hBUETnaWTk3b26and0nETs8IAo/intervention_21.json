Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash after a movie. The author mentions that it's a family habit to leave trash in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them after a movie, but the author argues that theaters have staff to clean up, especially since they seat 30 people now, making the task manageable. They also note the high cost of going to the movies and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In public places, it's generally expected to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving it behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The author's friend called them out, which suggests that at least some people find this behavior unacceptable. \n\nThen there's the argument about the cleanup staff. Even if there are people cleaning, the expectation is that individuals should take responsibility for their own trash. Theaters might have a system, but that doesn't mean it's okay for patrons to litter. It could add unnecessary work for staff and contribute to a messier environment for others. \n\nThe cost of the movie is another point. The user says it's expensive, but that doesn't justify not cleaning up. Paying for a ticket doesn't confer the right to leave trash. People who pay for services still have responsibilities to maintain cleanliness. \n\nThe author's upbringing is a factor. If their family didn't teach proper disposal habits, that's a background context. However, personal responsibility and societal norms might override family habits. \n\nSo, the main question is whether it's right to leave trash in public spaces. Most would say no, so the author is in the wrong. But the answer also has to consider the nuances like existing staff and cost. Still, the general consensus is that leaving trash is inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
