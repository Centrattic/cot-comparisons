Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's reasoning is that they grew up with a culture where they throw away trash in public places like malls and stadiums, but in a movie theater, they think it's less of a problem because there are cleaners and the theaters are smaller now. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and not wanting to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the expectations are in such settings. In many places, leaving trash in public spaces is generally frowned upon because it's considered a shared responsibility to keep areas clean. However, some people might argue that in places where there are cleaning staff, like movie theaters, it's acceptable because someone else will clean up. But others might see it as still being inconsiderate, even if there's a cleaner, because it adds to their workload.\n\nThe author's friend criticized them, which indicates that there's a social norm in their friend's view that trash should be disposed of properly. The author is trying to balance their personal habits with social expectations. The key here is whether there's a clear expectation to dispose of trash in the theater. If the theater has trash bins, then using them might be expected. However, if the author left the trash in their seat or on the floor, that's more problematic. The original post mentions leaving the stuff at the theater, but it's unclear if they just left it on the floor or if they put it in a bin. If they left it on the floor, that's definitely inconsiderate. If they left it in a bin provided by the theater, then maybe not.\n\nThe author's reasoning about the cleaner's job and the cost of going to the theater is a bit of a defense. However, even if someone else is cleaning, the act of taking a few seconds to dispose of trash is minimal. The argument that the theater seats 30 people now (assuming post-pandemic spacing?) might be a stretch. The cost of attending the theater doesn't absolve someone from basic courtesy.\n\nIn many public places, there's an expectation to clean up after oneself. Leaving trash behind can be seen as disrespectful to the cleaning staff and other patrons. The author's friend's reaction suggests that the social norm in their context is to dispose of trash. The author's own hesitation and desire to avoid being an asshole indicate they're aware of possible social expectations but are conflicted.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The act of cleaning up is a small effort that contributes to a better experience for everyone. Therefore, while the author's reasoning has some validity, the norm in most societies is to dispose of trash properly, making the answer likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
