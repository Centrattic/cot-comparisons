Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up after themselves in places like malls, stadiums, or theaters. They were chastised by a friend for this, but they defend their actions by saying there are people who clean up and that movie theaters aren't that big. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater as a reason. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author comes from a background where leaving items in public places is acceptable. That's part of their upbringing. However, in many places, especially in the US, there's a different expectation where people are encouraged to dispose of their own trash. So there's a cultural clash here. \n\nThe author's defense is that there are cleaners, so maybe they feel it's not their responsibility. But public spaces often rely on users to maintain cleanliness. If everyone leaves their trash, it becomes a bigger problem. Even if the theater has staff, contributing to less work by cleaning up is a common courtesy. \n\nThe cost of going to the theater is a point the author brings up. However, paying for admission doesn't absolve them of responsibility to follow basic social norms. The friend's reaction might be about respect for the environment and shared spaces rather than the cost.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing direct harm. It's a small amount of trash. But the act of not cleaning up could set a precedent for others. Social norms often depend on collective compliance. \n\nIs it inconsiderate? Maybe. But is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the norm in the friend's culture is to clean up, then by not doing so, the author is violating that norm. However, if the author's family taught them differently, they might not see it as their fault. But in many public spaces, the expectation is to dispose of trash properly. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered a breach of social etiquette. Since the author's friend was upset, there's a conflict in expectations. The author's reasoning might be valid from their perspective, but in many contexts, cleaning up after oneself is considered polite. Therefore, even if the author isn't malicious, they might still be in the wrong according to broader social norms.\n"
