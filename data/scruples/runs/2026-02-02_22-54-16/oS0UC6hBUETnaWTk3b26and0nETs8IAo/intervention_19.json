      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Their friend chastised them, but they argue that in their family culture, they didn't do that in places like malls or stadiums. They also mention that theaters now have smaller capacities (30 people) and that cleaning isn't a big task. Plus, they point out the high cost of going to the theater, implying that maybe it's not their responsibility to clean up. But they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are cultural norms, responsibility, and the actual impact of not cleaning up. The author's family didn't instill the habit of cleaning up in public places, but their friend disagrees. The author justifies it by saying there are cleaners and that the theaters aren't too crowded. But is that a valid reason?\n\nI think this is a bit of a gray area. On one hand, some people might feel it's good manners to clean up after yourself in public spaces to make things easier for staff and more pleasant for others. On the other hand, the author isn't the only person in the theater, and it's expected that staff handle clean-up. However, the act of throwing away your own trash is a small effort that could reduce the work for staff and improve the environment for others. If everyone left their trash, it would be a bigger issue, but since it's just one person, maybe it's not a huge deal. But the author's friend is upset, which might indicate that in some contexts, it's considered rude.\n\nThe author's reasoning about family culture is a defense, but norms can vary. The fact that they did clean up after being told might show they're trying to be considerate now. The cost of theater tickets isn't directly related to whether you should clean up, but maybe it's a way of saying they're paying a lot to not have to do extra work. However, that's not a strong argument against cleaning up.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the cultural norm in their family is different, maybe they aren't. But if the general societal expectation is to clean up, then they might be. It's a bit of a social etiquette question. In many places, it's considered polite to dispose of your trash properly in public, especially in enclosed spaces like a theater. Leaving it around could be seen as inconsiderate, even if someone else will eventually clean up.\n\nThe author's justification about the number of people (30 seat theater) might not hold because even in a small number, if everyone leaves trash, the staff still has to deal with it. But if it's just one person, the impact is minimal. However, the act of cleaning up is a social norm that's generally expected, so not doing it could be seen as wrong regardless of the actual impact.\n\nIn the end, the author is reflecting on their actions and trying to consider others' perspectives, which is a good sign. But whether they're in the wrong depends on societal expectations. If the friend's reaction is based on a common norm, then maybe the author is in the wrong. If the author's family's culture is acceptable in that context, maybe not. But generally, I think societal norms lean towards cleaning up after oneself in public places, so the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author is trying to be considerate and just has different habits, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
