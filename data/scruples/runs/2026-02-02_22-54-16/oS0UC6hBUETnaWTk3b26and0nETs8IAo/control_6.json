But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The person is explaining that in their family, they didn't do that in places like malls or stadiums, but their friend scolded them. They now throw away their stuff but aren't sure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Movie theaters are shared spaces, and leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate. Even though there are cleaning staff, it's generally expected that individuals dispose of their own waste. Leaving it might add to the workload for staff or create an unpleasant environment for others. \n\nThe author mentions that movie theaters now have around 30 seats, but the size doesn't matter much. The key is that it's a public place where people expect to leave it clean. The cost of the ticket doesn't change the fact that trash should be disposed of properly. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is outside the norm in society, even if the author's family had a different practice. Social norms can vary, but when in a public space, following general etiquette is usually expected. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious, just maybe unaware. But the act of not disposing of trash in public is generally considered rude or inconsiderate. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They should take their trash with them regardless of the setting.\n"
