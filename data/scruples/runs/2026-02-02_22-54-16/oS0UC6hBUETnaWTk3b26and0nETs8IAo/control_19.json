But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person from the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again. The person didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater, following their family's culture. Their friend called them out on it, and now they're wondering if they're an asshole. The person argues that theaters have cleaning staff and that it's expensive to go there, so maybe it's not a big deal.\n\nHmm. The question is whether they're wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, leaving trash behind is generally considered impolite and inconsiderate, especially in public spaces. Even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of respect for the environment and other people. On the other hand, the person grew up with different habits and might not have considered the impact.\n\nBut wait, the movie theater is a shared space. Even if someone else cleans up, leaving trash can create a mess for others. Also, the number of people in a theater now is 30, but if everyone does the same, the cleaners have more work. The person might not be in the wrong if their family's culture is different, but societal norms usually expect people to dispose of their trash properly. The fact that they felt bad after being called out shows some awareness. However, justifying it by saying it's expensive to go to the movies doesn't really excuse the behavior. It's not about the cost but about being considerate. So, the answer would likely be that they are in the wrong because proper disposal of trash is a basic social norm, regardless of personal habits or the presence of cleaners.\n"
