      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that they grew up in a family where they didn't dispose of trash in certain public places, like malls, football stadiums, and movie theaters. Their friend scolded them for this, but the author argues that theaters have cleaning staff, especially since post-pandemic, theaters are seating fewer people (like 30 per showing), making the task of cleaning easier. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and not wanting to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about personal responsibility versus the presence of cleaning staff. The author's defense is that there are people to clean up, so maybe they don't need to. However, in many public places, it's considered good etiquette to clean up after yourself, even if there are staff. Leaving trash on the floor could be seen as inconsiderate to others and adds to the workload of staff. \n\nThe author's family culture might have instilled this behavior, but that doesn't necessarily make it right in a social context. The argument about the number of people in theaters now is a bit of a stretch. Even if each showing has fewer people, if everyone left their trash, it would add up quickly for the staff. Also, the cost of the movie ticket doesn't absolve the responsibility to be considerate. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that some people do find this behavior unacceptable. However, others might understand that there are cleaners. It's a bit of a cultural or social norm issue. But overall, leaving trash behind is generally frowned upon. So, the author might not be a total asshole, but they are in the wrong for not disposing of their trash. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
