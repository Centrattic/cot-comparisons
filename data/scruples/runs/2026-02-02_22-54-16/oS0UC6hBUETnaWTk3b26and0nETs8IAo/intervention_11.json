      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's friend rebuked them, but they don't feel wrong because there are people to clean up, the theaters are small, and movie tickets are expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if leaving trash in public places is considered wrong. Generally, public etiquette suggests cleaning up after yourself in shared spaces. However, there's a nuance here. The author mentions that the theaters have limited capacity now (30 people) and that there are cleaners. So maybe the impact isn't huge. But still, it's a public space where others might sit after you. Leaving trash could be considered inconsiderate, even if someone else cleans it up later.\n\nThe author justifies it by saying it's expensive to go to the movies. That's not really a justification for not cleaning up. People pay for things but still follow social norms. Also, the main point is about personal responsibility and respect for shared spaces. Even if the theater has staff, it's about being considerate to others and maintaining cleanliness.\n\nThe author's friend called them out, which is a social signal that the behavior isn't accepted. So, from a social norms perspective, the author is in the wrong. But there's a counterpoint: maybe the theater's current setup (smaller crowds due to pandemic restrictions?) reduces the need for individual cleanup. However, the general expectation is still to dispose of trash properly. \n\nAnother angle: if everyone left their trash, the place would be dirty. Even if one person does it, it's part of a larger issue. So the author's action contributes to a problem. Even though there are cleaners, it's about showing respect and consideration for the environment and other patrons. \n\nThe argument about the cost of movies doesn't hold because people still have to follow basic etiquette regardless of how much they paid. It's not about the cost but about being a good citizen in a shared space. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they didn't clean up their trash, which is a basic social expectation. The justifications provided don't override the general expectation to dispose of waste properly in public places. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
