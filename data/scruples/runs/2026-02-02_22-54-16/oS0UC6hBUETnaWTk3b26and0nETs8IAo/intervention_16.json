Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The author mentions that they were raised in a culture where they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls, stadiums, or theaters. Their friend scolded them for this after a movie, but the author argues that theaters have staff to clean up, and since theaters now seat around 30 people, it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author's upbringing is different from what their friend expects. However, in most public spaces, it's generally considered courteous to dispose of your trash properly. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash behind can create issues, especially in enclosed spaces. The argument about the number of seats might not be valid because even if it's a small theater, leaving trash is still unhygienic and could be a fire hazard.\n\nThe cost of the theater isn't a justification for not cleaning up. The responsibility isn't about how much you paid but about being a considerate member of the community. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate to others. While the author isn't the only one who might do this, the fact that they were called out by a friend indicates that their action was not appropriate in that context. \n\nHowever, the author is reflecting on their behavior and trying to understand if they're wrong, which shows they care. But the act itself\u2014leaving trash in a public place\u2014is generally seen as inconsiderate. The presence of staff doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up; it's about respect for shared spaces. So, even if others do it, the author is still in the wrong for not following the expected social norm.\n"
