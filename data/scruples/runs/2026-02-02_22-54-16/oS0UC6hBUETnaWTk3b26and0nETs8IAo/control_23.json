      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The person says they grew up in a family where this was the norm\u2014like at malls, football stadiums, and theaters. But their friend scolded them after a movie, and now they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author mentions their family's culture. So maybe in their upbringing, leaving things wasn't a big deal. But in other places, people might expect you to clean up after yourself. Theaters, especially, can get really busy. If everyone left their trash, it would pile up quickly. The cleaning staff might have more work than necessary. Even if the theaters seat 30 people now, each showing could have multiple groups, and the cleanup happens between shows or after each session. Maybe the staff has a set schedule or specific tasks, and extra trash could make their job harder.\n\nThe author argues that it's expensive to go to the theater, so they didn't want to spend extra on cleaning. But that's not a valid point because cleaning is part of the theater's operational costs, not an extra charge for the customer. Also, the idea that it's \"not a big task\" might be overlooking the cumulative effect. If many people do this, it adds up. Theaters probably have policies about cleaning, expecting patrons to dispose of trash properly to maintain a clean environment for all.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that there's a social expectation to clean up. Even if the author's family didn't follow this, society at large might. The author is concerned about being an asshole, which shows they care about being considerate. However, leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate to others who have to clean up and to the next audience members who don't want to sit in a messy environment.\n\nAnother angle is responsibility. If you bring trash into a public space, it's generally expected to take it out. This is a common courtesy in many cultures. Theaters, like other public venues, rely on patrons to help maintain cleanliness. The author's argument that there are people to clean might be valid, but relying on them to do extra work isn't considerate. It's a shared responsibility to keep public spaces tidy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and against general social norms, even if their family didn't follow that practice. The friend's scolding indicates that there's a difference in expectations. While the author isn't a monster for not cleaning up immediately, there's a case to be made that they should follow the expected behavior in public spaces to be considerate of others and the environment.\n"
