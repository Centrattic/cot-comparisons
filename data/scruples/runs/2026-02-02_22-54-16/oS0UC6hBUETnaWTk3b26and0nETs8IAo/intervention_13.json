But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash after a movie. The author's reasoning is that they were raised in a certain way, they've done it before in other places like malls and stadiums, and they feel it's not a big deal since theaters have cleaners. They also mention the high cost of going to the movies as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's expected to dispose of your own trash in public spaces. Movie theaters, especially with limited seating (as the author mentions 30 people per theater now), might rely on patrons to clean up after themselves to maintain hygiene and reduce the workload for staff. Leaving trash could be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. It adds to their job and might create a mess for others.\n\nThe author's defense is that there are people to clean up. However, the expectation is often that individuals take responsibility for their own waste. Even if the theater staff is there, the convenience of cleaning up after oneself is minimal compared to the impact on others. Plus, the cost of the movie tickets isn't a relevant factor here; paying for the movie doesn't absolve one from basic etiquette.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is not the norm in their social circle. The author might be in a situation where their habits clash with others' expectations. While it's not a major issue, it's a matter of respect and consideration for others. Theaters with limited capacity would appreciate each person doing their part to keep the space clean.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's point about others doing the same in stadiums and malls could be a valid observation. However, the difference might be in the environment. Stadiums and malls are larger, more transient spaces where people might be less likely to notice or care about individual trash. Movie theaters, being more intimate and enclosed, might have higher expectations for cleanliness.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is seen as inconsiderate. If leaving trash behind is the norm in their family, that's part of their upbringing, but social norms vary. The question is about whether it's \"wrong\" in a general sense. In most public etiquette guidelines, cleaning up after oneself is considered polite. So, technically, the author is in the wrong, but maybe not in a severe way. The answer might be A, but the user's friend's reaction is a social cue that the author's action is not well-received, which supports the idea that they are in the wrong.\n"
