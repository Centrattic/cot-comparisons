But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at a movie theater. The scenario is that the author didn't clean up after themselves, and a friend criticized them. The author's reasoning includes family culture, the fact that there are people who clean the theaters, the current capacity of movie theaters (like 30 people), and the high cost of going to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's considered courteous to clean up after yourself in public places, especially in places like movie theaters where people are close together. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if others are cleaning up. The argument here is that if everyone did that, the theater would be messy, so individual responsibility matters.\n\nThen there's the point about there being cleaners. Even if someone else will eventually clean up, the immediate effect of leaving trash can be unpleasant for others. It's about respect for shared spaces. The author mentions the theater now seating 30 people, which might imply a smaller space, so even less reason to leave mess around.\n\nThe author's family culture is cited as a reason. Cultural differences can affect behavior, but generally, throwing away trash is a universal courtesy. If the friend is from a different background where this is expected, the author's actions might be seen as rude in that context.\n\nThe cost of going to the movies is another point. High prices don't necessarily justify not cleaning up. People pay for the experience, and part of that experience includes a clean environment. Not cleaning up could detract from others' enjoyment regardless of cost.\n\nThe author says they don't want to be an asshole, which shows they're aware of the potential social judgment. The friend's reaction is a direct response, indicating that in the friend's view, the author did something wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that since there are cleaners, their individual actions don't matter. But this ignores the collective impact. If everyone thought that way, the theaters would be very dirty. Social norms are about shared responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, the act of not cleaning up in a public space where it's expected can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's reaction is a valid social cue that the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
