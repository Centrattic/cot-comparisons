But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The scenario is that the author grew up not doing this, but their friend scolded them. The author argues that there are cleaners and that movie theaters are expensive, so maybe it's not a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, public places expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. It adds to their workload and might not be hygienic for others. The fact that the author's friend called them out suggests that in the friend's eyes, it was wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that there are people to clean up, and the expense of the theater. But even if the theater is expensive, individual responsibility to dispose of trash properly is usually expected. Arguing that cleaners exist doesn't negate the expectation to do your part. Also, the scale of the theater (30 seats) isn't that large, but that's not the main point. The main point is about personal responsibility and being considerate of others' experience.\n\nThe author wants to avoid being an asshole, so their intention is good. However, actions speak louder than intentions. Leaving trash behind could be seen as inconsiderate regardless of intent. The fact that they now throw away their trash after being called out shows they're open to feedback, but the original action might still be considered wrong by many standards.\n\nSo, balancing these points, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), because not cleaning up is generally considered inconsiderate. But I should check if there are cultural or situational factors. The author mentions their family's culture, but that doesn't excuse the behavior in a public setting. Social norms usually take precedence over individual upbringing in such cases.\n"
