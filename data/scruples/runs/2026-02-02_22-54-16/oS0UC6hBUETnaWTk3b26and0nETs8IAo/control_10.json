But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The friend criticized them, but the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not cleaning up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are janitors who clean up later. The author mentions that their family's culture didn't emphasize this, but that's their upbringing. However, societal expectations might be different from their personal habits.\n\nThe author argues that movie theaters have people who clean up, so maybe they don't see the necessity of doing it themselves. But the presence of janitors doesn't absolve individuals from responsibility. If everyone left their trash, the theaters would be more crowded with litter, making the environment less pleasant for others. Plus, even if it's not a huge task, it's a small effort that shows consideration.\n\nThe cost of going to the theater is mentioned, but the friend's reaction seems more about etiquette than money. The author's justification about the number of people (30 seats) might not hold if every person leaves their trash. Even a small number multiplied by many people adds up.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal responsibility versus societal expectations. The author isn't causing direct harm, just convenience. But in public spaces, respecting others' experience is important. The friend's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is pointing out that being considerate is part of being a good community member.\n\nSo, while the author isn't a complete asshole, they might be in the wrong in terms of social etiquette. The key is whether not cleaning up is an asshole move. The answer might hinge on balancing personal habits with general social norms. Since the friend is upset, and the author acknowledges the need to be considerate, maybe the answer is yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
