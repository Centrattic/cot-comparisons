But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family's culture was to leave things at places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. A friend scolded them, so they threw it away afterwards but are still unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, public places expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash around is considered inconsiderate because it's the responsibility of others to clean up. Even though the author points out that theaters have staff to clean, the expectation is still on patrons to dispose of their own trash properly. \n\nThe author also mentions the cost of going to the theater. While that's a personal expense, it doesn't justify leaving trash. People pay for the experience, which includes maintaining cleanliness. \n\nAnother point is the number of people in the theater. But even a small number of people can accumulate litter, and it's courteous to help maintain a clean environment for others. The author's friend was upset, which indicates that the friend felt it was important. \n\nHowever, the author isn't malicious; they just grew up with different habits. They did correct their behavior after being told. Intentions matter here. They aren't being inconsiderate on purpose now. \n\nBut the act of not disposing of trash is still littering, regardless of intent. The right thing to do is to throw it away, even if it's not a big hassle for others. It's about respecting shared spaces and the people who work there. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because leaving trash in public places is generally frowned upon, even if the staff cleans up. It's a matter of personal responsibility and consideration for others.\n"
