Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person says they grew up not doing that, and their friend scolded them. They argue that there are people to clean, and it's expensive to go to the movies.\n\nHmm, so first, is there a general expectation to clean up after yourself in public places like theaters? I think in many places, yes. Leaving trash around isn't considered polite. But maybe in some cultures or families, they don't do that. The person mentions their family's culture, so maybe that's part of it. But public spaces usually have rules about cleanliness for everyone's comfort.\n\nThe person says the theaters seat 30 people now, implying it's a smaller place. But even if it's a small venue, the responsibility to maintain cleanliness is on everyone. Leaving trash for others to clean up isn't considerate. The argument about cost of the theater tickets being high doesn't really justify not cleaning up. Paying for a ticket doesn't mean you can leave a mess.\n\nAlso, the person says they don't want to be an asshole. If their friend called them out, that's a sign that their behavior was inappropriate. Even if others are cleaning, it's a sign of respect to clean up after oneself. It's not about the cleaners' job being too big, but about being considerate to others and contributing to a clean environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They didn't clean up, which is expected in public places, and their reasons don't hold up. The answer should be A.\n"
