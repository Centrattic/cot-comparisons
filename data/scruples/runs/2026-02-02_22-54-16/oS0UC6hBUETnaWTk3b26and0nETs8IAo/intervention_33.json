      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at a movie theater.\n\nThe author mentions that this is a family culture, so they've been doing it their whole life. Their friend criticized them, but they still don't feel wrong because theaters have staff to clean up. They also point out that movie theaters now have smaller capacities (30 people) and tickets are expensive. They want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, societal norms usually expect people to clean up after themselves, even in places that have cleaning staff. Leaving trash behind might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it adds to the staff's workload. But the author argues that with fewer people, it's not a big task. That's a valid point, but maybe the principle is more about personal responsibility rather than the actual impact.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the norm in their circle is to dispose of trash. The author's habit might be different, but in a public space, following the general expectation is polite. However, the author isn't causing harm; they're not littering outside the theater. The staff's job is to clean up, but if everyone leaves trash, it adds up. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being intentionally inconsiderate; they're just following a family tradition. It's a cultural difference. The cost of the ticket doesn't justify leaving trash; that's a separate issue. The key here is whether the action is seen as wrong in the broader social context, not just the author's perspective.\n\nSo, the author isn't malicious, but they are contradicting a common social norm. However, since it's a minor issue and the staff is present, maybe it's not a huge wrong. They are in a gray area. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the severity. Since the expected behavior is to clean up, even in public places, the author is technically in the wrong by not doing so. However, the answer might depend on how strict the community's norms are. In many places, leaving trash in a theater is considered inconsiderate. So, the answer is A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
