Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. They mentioned their family's culture, friends' reactions, and the cost of going to the theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In most places, it's expected to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash behind is generally considered rude or inconsiderate. The author's friend was upset about it, which suggests that their friend believes the author was wrong.\n\nThe author argues that theaters are cleaned by staff and it's not a big task. But even if there are people cleaning, the norm is still to dispose of your own trash. Leaving it for others to clean up adds to their workload unnecessarily. Plus, the cost of the ticket doesn't justify not cleaning up. It's about respect for shared spaces and others who use them.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that movie theaters now seat 30 people. Maybe they're referring to smaller screens or post-pandemic spacing, but regardless, it's still a public space. Even if the theater is less crowded, the principle remains. It's about being considerate and following basic etiquette.\n\nThe author is trying not to be an asshole, which is a good start, but the action of leaving trash is still problematic. The friend's reaction is valid because it's a common expectation. So, while the author might not have malicious intent, they are in the wrong by not disposing of their trash.\n"
