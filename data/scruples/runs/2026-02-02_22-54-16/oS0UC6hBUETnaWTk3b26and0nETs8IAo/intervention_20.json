      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They grew up in a family where they would leave trash at places like the mall food court, football stadiums, and movie theaters. Their friend scolded them after a movie, so they did throw it away this time. They argue that there are cleaners who handle the theaters, and since theaters now have around 30 seats, it's not a big task. Also, going to the theater is expensive, so they feel like they're not being an asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In some places, people might leave their trash until cleaning staff come, while others might see it as common courtesy to dispose of it. The person's upbringing is different, so they might not see it as wrong. However, their friend did take issue with it, which is a point against their behavior.\n\nBut the author makes a counterpoint about the cleaning staff. If the theater is designed to have people clean up after shows, maybe the responsibility isn't on the individual. However, leaving trash behind can create a mess for others during the movie. Popcorn and drink cups can be tripped over, or the smell might bother others. Also, even if it's not a big task for cleaners, the responsibility might be more about respect for shared spaces.\n\nThe cost of going to the theater is mentioned. Maybe the author feels like they paid for their ticket and thus have the right to not clean up, but that's not a strong argument. Public spaces require some level of consideration for others, regardless of cost. \n\nAnother angle: if everyone left their trash, the theater would be a mess. Even if one person does it, it's a small contribution, but collectively it adds up. The author might not see the harm, but others might. The friend's reaction suggests that some people find it unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the theater's cleaning staff are expected to handle this, and the author isn't causing an undue burden. If the theater is designed for a certain number of people and they have the resources to clean up, maybe it's okay. But again, individual responsibility vs. collective action. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is within social norms. In many places, it's considered polite to dispose of your trash in public spaces. Leaving it can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if there are cleaners, the expectation is to contribute to keeping the space clean. The author might not be in the wrong if their culture is different, but the question is if they are in the wrong now. Since the friend is upset and the general expectation might be to dispose of trash, the answer could lean towards yes. However, the author's reasoning about cleaners and cost is a mitigating factor. \n\nBut social norms often prioritize respect for shared spaces. So even if the theater can handle it, the act of not cleaning up might still be seen as wrong because it's a matter of consideration. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
