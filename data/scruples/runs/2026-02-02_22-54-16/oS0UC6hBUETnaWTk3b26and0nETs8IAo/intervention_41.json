But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The writer mentions that it's a family habit to do so in certain places like malls or stadiums but not in theaters. Their friend scolded them, but they argue that theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go there now.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the social norms. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces, even if there are staff. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a place where people have to clean up after others. Theaters might be a bit different because they're designed for seating and have regular cleaning schedules, but that doesn't mean it's okay to leave your trash. It's about respect for the environment and others who use the space after you.\n\nThe author says they don't feel wrong because there are cleaners. But just because someone else is responsible for cleaning doesn't mean the person should leave the mess. It's a basic courtesy. Also, the argument about the cost of going to the theater\u2014maybe they feel like they're paying for the experience and should get to keep the space clean, but that's not a valid excuse for not cleaning up their own trash.\n\nThe friend pointing it out is probably trying to be helpful. The author might be in a culture or family where this isn't emphasized, but social norms can vary. The key here is that even if it's not a huge burden for cleaners, it's still a small act of consideration. So, is the author in the wrong? I think yes, because leaving trash behind is generally considered inconsiderate, regardless of the presence of cleaning staff. The answer would be A.\n"
