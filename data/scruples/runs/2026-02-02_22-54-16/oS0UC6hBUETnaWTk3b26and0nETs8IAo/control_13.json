      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading their situation again. They didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater, which is something their family did as a cultural norm. They mention doing similar things at the mall food court and football stadiums. Their friend called them out after the movie, and now they're questioning whether they're an asshole.\n\nThe author argues that there are people who clean the theaters, and since movie theaters now have smaller capacities (like 30 people), the cleanup isn't a big task. Plus, they mention that going to the movies is expensive, so maybe they feel they're entitled to not clean up. But they also don't want to be seen as an asshole.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The key points here are about social norms and responsibility. Generally, in public places, it's considered polite to clean up after oneself. Movie theaters are usually strict about this because they're enclosed spaces and mess can be a problem. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash behind adds to their workload. The argument that the theaters seat only 30 people now might be a stretch. Maybe they're referring to capacity restrictions due to something like the pandemic, but even then, every bit of trash adds up. \n\nAlso, the author's friend was upset, which suggests that their behavior was perceived as inconsiderate. Even if the author doesn't feel wrong, others might see it as a breach of social etiquette. The fact that they threw away their trash after being chastised shows they care about others' opinions, but the initial action still caused a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that cleaners exist, so maybe they don't see it as their responsibility. But society generally expects patrons to dispose of their trash properly, not relying on others to clean up after them. It's a matter of shared responsibility. Plus, in a theater setting, leaving mess can be unhygienic and affect others' experience. \n\nSo considering all this, the author probably is in the wrong. They violated a common courtesy, even if they don't feel it's a big deal. The answer would be A.\n"
