But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention that in their family, it's just the culture to leave things there in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. A friend scolded them after the movie, but the author feels it's okay because there are cleaners, the theaters aren't too crowded now, and movie tickets are expensive. They also don't want to be seen as an asshole.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about personal habits versus social norms. The author's upbringing led them to leave items, but their friend reacted negatively. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if others agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider social expectations. In many places, it's customary to clean up after yourself in public spaces, even if there are cleaning staff. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, contributing to more work for employees and potentially a mess for others. The author's reasoning includes the existence of cleaners and the current lower capacity in theaters. But even if there are cleaners, taking a few seconds to dispose of trash is a considerate act. Also, the argument about cost of tickets doesn't directly relate to responsibility for cleaning. Theaters charge a lot, but that doesn't mean patrons can leave a mess. \n\nHowever, the author isn't causing harm beyond maybe a small inconvenience. Theaters do have cleaning staff, so maybe the impact is minimal. But social norms often dictate that individuals should dispose of their own trash, regardless of who cleans up later. The friend's reaction might be based on personal preference or a different cultural upbringing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the norm in the community or the specific theater is to clean up, then not doing so might be seen as wrong. However, if the author's family's culture has been different and the theater isn't overwhelmed, maybe it's a minor issue. Since the user is asking for an opinion, and the options are binary, I have to choose between A and B.\n\nConsidering that the author is aware of the friend's disapproval and is questioning their actions, it's possible that in this context, the expectation is to clean up. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A). But others might argue that it's not a big deal. However, given the phrasing of the question and the options, the answer might lean towards A because the friend's reaction and the general expectation to clean up in public spaces would place the responsibility on the individual, even if others clean later. So, Answer A.\n"
