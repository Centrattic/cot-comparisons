      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that in their family, they didn't clean up after themselves in places like malls or stadiums. They left stuff around and only just threw it away at the movie theater after being chastised by a friend. The author's reasoning is that theaters have staff to clean up, and since they're expensive to attend, maybe it's not their responsibility. They also mention that movie theaters now might have fewer seats (30 people) making cleanup easier. But they're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo the main points here are: personal habits vs. societal expectations, the role of cleaning staff, and the cost of going to the theater. \n\nFrom a societal norm perspective, most places expect individuals to clean up after themselves to maintain order and respect shared spaces. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash around can create more work for them and might be seen as disrespectful. The author's friend pointed this out, indicating that their behavior was noticeable and perhaps off-putting.\n\nThe argument about cleaners is valid, but it's similar to the \"someone will clean up anyway\" argument in other public spaces. However, the expectation is still for individuals to dispose of their own trash to minimize the burden on staff. Plus, even with a small number of seats, littering the theater would still be unhygienic and unpleasant for others.\n\nThe cost of the theater visit doesn't absolve someone from basic etiquette. Paying for the ticket doesn't grant permission to be inconsiderate. The author's justification that they only started recycling the habit after being told suggests that they're aware there's a socially acceptable standard, even if they didn't follow it before.\n\nThe author's friend's reaction is a sign that their behavior is not in line with what others expect. While everyone makes mistakes, the key here is whether there's a clear wrong. Leaving trash behind is a common courtesy issue. Theaters often have trash bins for a reason, so using them isn't a hassle. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they're adding to the mess others have to deal with, both customers and staff.\n\nIn summary, even though the author's reasoning has some points about cleaners and cost, the societal expectation is to clean up after oneself in public places. The friend's reaction and the general norm suggest that the author is in the wrong. So, the answer should be A.\n"
