      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that they grew up with a culture where they didn't dispose of trash in places like food courts, stadiums, and theaters until a friend scolded them. Now they feel conflicted because they think the theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go there, but they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, public places expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind is considered rude and inconsiderate because it adds to the cleaner's workload and can create a mess for other patrons. Even if there are cleaners, it's still a courtesy to dispose of your own trash. Theaters might have smaller seating areas now due to social distancing, but that doesn't change the expectation. \n\nThe author's justification is that there are cleaners, but that's not a valid excuse. It's about being considerate. Also, the cost of the ticket doesn't justify leaving trash. The friend's reaction is a sign that the behavior is socially unacceptable. \n\nHowever, the author is reflecting and has started to change their behavior by throwing away their trash after the friend's comment. That shows they are open to learning. But the initial action of not cleaning up was against common social etiquette. So while the author isn't a complete asshole, they were in the wrong in that specific instance. The answer should be A.\n"
