But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario did something wrong by not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person justifies their actions based on family culture, the fact that there are cleaners, the current theater capacity being small, and the high cost of going to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Usually, people are expected to clean up after themselves in shared environments. However, the person argues that there are staff to clean up, which is true. But maybe the expectation is still on individuals to dispose of their trash properly to avoid extra work for staff or to maintain cleanliness.\n\nThen there's the cultural aspect. The person's family didn't teach them to clean up in such places, which might explain their behavior. But does that make it okay? I think societal norms can differ, but there's a general understanding in public places to be considerate.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a point too. If a friend is upset, it might indicate that the action was socially frowned upon in that context. However, the person did adjust their behavior next time, showing they care about their friend's opinion.\n\nThe cost of attending the theater is mentioned as a reason. The idea is that paying a lot should allow some leniency, but that's a bit of a stretch. Responsibility for cleanliness isn't usually tied to the cost of the experience.\n\nTheaters seating 30 people now\u2014maybe due to social distancing or other factors\u2014could mean less crowding, but it doesn't directly relate to the responsibility to dispose of trash. Even in a less crowded space, it's still considered polite to clean up.\n\nI should also think about the impact. Leaving trash can create litter, which affects others and requires cleaning. It's a small action, but it's part of maintaining a clean environment for everyone. So while it's not a huge issue, the person is ignoring a common courtesy.\n\nOn the other hand, the person isn't intentionally trying to be inconsiderate. They grew up differently and are now reflecting on it. Their friend's feedback made them adjust, which is a positive change.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the action is minor, the person is aware and changing their behavior, but the act itself is considered inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong, but it's a small thing. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But according to societal norms, not cleaning up in public is generally frowned upon, so the answer might be A (Yes), but there's nuance.\n"
