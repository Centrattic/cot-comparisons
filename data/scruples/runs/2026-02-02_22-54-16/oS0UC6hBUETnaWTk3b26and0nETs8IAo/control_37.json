Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's reasoning includes family culture, the presence of cleaning staff, and the high cost of movie tickets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, leaving trash in public spaces, even if there are cleaners, is generally considered rude. People are expected to dispose of their waste properly. The author's friend criticized them, which suggests that in some circles, this behavior is frowned upon.\n\nThe author argues that there are cleaners, so maybe it's not a big deal. But even with cleaners, leaving trash can make the environment less pleasant for others. It's about consideration for the next person. Also, the high cost of tickets doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up after oneself. The cost is a separate issue from personal responsibility.\n\nFamily culture is mentioned as a reason. While family habits can influence behavior, societal norms often override family practices when they conflict. If the family norm is to leave trash, but society expects otherwise, the author should adapt to social expectations to avoid being seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. Some might argue that if the theater has staff to clean up, maybe it's not a huge issue. But that's a bit of a stretch. Even if someone else will clean up, it's still considered polite to dispose of your trash. It shows respect for the space and others.\n\nThe author's friend's reaction indicates that some people do mind. So, the author's actions, while perhaps not illegal or harmful in a physical sense, are socially frowned upon. The key here is about social etiquette and respect for shared spaces.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there are cleaners and the author's family may have different habits, the socially acceptable norm is to dispose of trash properly. The author's behavior, while not malicious, is inconsiderate and thus they are in the wrong.\n"
