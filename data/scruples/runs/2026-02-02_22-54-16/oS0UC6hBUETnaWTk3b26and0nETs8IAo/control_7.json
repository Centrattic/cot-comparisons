      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that they grew up in a family culture where they didn't clean up after themselves in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. However, a friend criticized them for this after a movie, and now they're conflicted.\n\nThe author argues that theaters have staff to clean up, and with smaller seating (30 people now), it's not a big task. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater as a reason not to stress over it. But they're worried about being seen as an asshole.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Public etiquette often suggests that people should dispose of their trash properly, not just because someone else will clean up. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash around can be unsanitary, create clutter, and make the experience worse for others. The argument about the cost of the theater doesn't really relate to the responsibility to clean up. \n\nThe author's friend took the time to correct them, which might indicate that their behavior is noticed and possibly frowned upon. The fact that they threw away their trash after being told shows they can change, but the initial action might still be considered inconsiderate. Even if the cleanup is handled by staff, it's a matter of respect for the environment and other patrons. So, while it's not a huge offense, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on others and the general expectation of cleaning up after oneself in public spaces.\n"
