Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person's friend criticized them for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Typically, in places like movie theaters, people are expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be considered inconsiderate, especially since others are paying to clean up after everyone. However, the person mentions that there are people who clean the theaters, and given that theaters now have fewer seats (like 30 people), maybe the cleanup isn't too burdensome. They also point out the cost of going to the theater, implying they're getting value for their money. \n\nBut then again, even if there are cleaners, leaving trash can create a mess for others, and not everyone may clean up. It's about being considerate. The friend's reaction suggests that their culture or expectations differ. The author's family didn't emphasize this, so it's a cultural difference. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the general social norm is to dispose of your trash properly. Even if the cleaners handle it, it's polite and respectful to others to do so. Leaving trash behind can be seen as a lack of consideration, even if it's not a huge effort for someone else to clean. The argument about cost and theater size might not justify not cleaning up. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because not cleaning up is against the common social expectation. However, the author didn't do anything harmful, just didn't clean up. The friend's reaction could be overzealous. But I think the consensus would be that the author is wrong for not cleaning up. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
