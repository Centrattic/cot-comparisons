      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their family's culture was to leave trash in places like the mall food court, football stadiums, and movie theaters. They were reprimanded by a friend for not doing so after a movie. However, they argue that there are cleaners who handle the theaters and that it's expensive to go to the movies now, so maybe it's not their responsibility.\n\nI need to consider social norms and etiquette. Generally, public places expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind is considered inconsiderate because it adds to the workload of staff and creates a mess for others. Even though there are cleaners, it's a shared responsibility to maintain cleanliness. The author's reasoning that there are people to clean up might not hold in polite society; being considerate is about not expecting others to clean up after you, especially in a public setting where everyone contributes to the mess.\n\nAlso, the fact that movie theaters now seat 30 people might be a mistake\u2014I know that's actually a small number, but maybe the author meant larger theaters. Regardless, the scale of the cleanup might not matter as much as personal responsibility. The argument that it's expensive to go to the theater doesn't excuse littering. People are expected to follow basic etiquette regardless of the cost of admission.\n\nThe author's friend called them out, which indicates that the friend believes it's wrong. The author is conflicted but doesn't feel entirely wrong. However, the general consensus in most societies is that cleaning up after yourself is a social norm, so the author might indeed be in the wrong. The key point is whether leaving trash is seen as inconsiderate, which it usually is. So, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
