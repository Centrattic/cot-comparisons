      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author explains that their family's culture didn't emphasize cleaning up after themselves in public places like malls, stadiums, or theaters. They left things behind before, but this time their friend called them out. The author defends their action by saying that theaters have staff to clean, and since they seat 30 people now (maybe due to capacity restrictions?), it's not a big task. They also mention that going to the theater is expensive, so maybe they feel it's a small part of the cost. However, they're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal responsibility and social norms. The friend is upset because the author didn't clean up, which others might see as littering or being inconsiderate. The author argues that there are cleaners, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable. Even if someone else is responsible for cleaning, leaving trash behind isn't considerate. It could also increase the workload for cleaning staff or create a mess for others.\n\nAnother angle is the societal expectation. In many places, it's considered good manners to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving it behind might be seen as inconsiderate of others and the environment, even if it's someone else's job to clean up. The author's reasoning about the cost of going to the theater doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up. The cost is about their own expense, not the impact on others or the environment.\n\nThe author's friend is part of the situation. The friend's reaction indicates that this behavior is not acceptable in their view. Social norms can vary, but generally, public spaces are shared, and maintaining cleanliness is a collective effort. Even if the theater seats fewer people, it's still a public place, and leaving trash affects everyone using it. The argument that it's not a big task for cleaners doesn't take into account the fact that every bit of trash adds up and can make their job harder.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt bad after the friend's comment and did clean up. That shows some awareness of the issue. The question is whether they were in the wrong initially. From a general perspective, leaving trash in public spaces is typically frowned upon. It's a matter of respect for shared spaces and consideration for others. The fact that they later corrected their behavior is a positive step, but the initial action is still questionable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
