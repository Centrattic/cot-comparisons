      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away empty drinks and popcorn at a movie theater. The author mentions that this is a family norm, having done it at malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them, but they don't feel wrong because there are cleaners and theaters aren't too crowded. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are cultural norms versus societal expectations. The author's family grew up in a culture where they don't dispose of trash in public places, which is their upbringing. However, in many places, especially in the US, it's common to throw away your trash after using a public space. Movie theaters might have staff to clean, but it's still considered polite to leave the space as clean as possible for others. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that this is a social norm they follow. The author's reasoning is that since there are cleaners, maybe it's not a big deal. But even if there are cleaners, it's about respecting shared spaces. Leaving trash behind can contribute to litter and make the environment less pleasant for others. Also, the argument about the number of people in the theater (30 seats) doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up. \n\nThe cost of going to the theater being high is another point. Maybe the author feels that since it's expensive, they should get value, but that doesn't justify leaving trash. The main issue is about consideration for others. Even if it's a small task, it's a matter of social etiquette. \n\nIn many cultures, being considerate includes cleaning up after oneself in public. The author might not be in the wrong in their family's eyes, but from a broader societal perspective, they are expected to dispose of their trash. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the norm in public spaces is to clean up, and not doing so is seen as inconsiderate, regardless of family habits.\n"
