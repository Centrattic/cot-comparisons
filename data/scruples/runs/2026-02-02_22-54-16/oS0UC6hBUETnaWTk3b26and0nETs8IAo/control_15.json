But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention their family's culture of not doing so in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them, but the person is conflicted because they think there are cleaners and theaters aren't too crowded now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, public spaces expect people to clean up after themselves. Movie theaters are usually seen as places where you should dispose of trash properly. Leaving trash might be considered rude or inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The cleaners have a job, but expecting them to manage the mess from everyone might add to their workload unnecessarily.\n\nThe person's argument is that it's expensive to go to the movies, so maybe they feel entitled to some leniency. But that's not a strong justification for leaving trash. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that the friend holds the view that it's important to clean up, which is a common perspective. \n\nThe user is unsure if they're an asshole. The key here is whether the action is considered inconsiderate. Even if others clean up, the standard is usually to dispose of your own trash. Leaving it might contribute to a mess and could be seen as disrespectful to the staff. So, the answer would lean towards the person being in the wrong. But there's a counterpoint about the cleaners' job. However, social expectations often take precedence over that. So probably answer A.\n"
