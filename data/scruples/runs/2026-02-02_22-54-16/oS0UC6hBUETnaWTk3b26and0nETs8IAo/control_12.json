      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family didn't do that, and they've done it at other places like malls and stadiums. A friend scolded them, but they argue that movie theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go there.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, the main points here are cultural habits versus social norms. The author is used to a family culture where they don't clean up after themselves in public places. However, their friend took issue with it. The author's justification is that there are cleaners and that it's expensive to go to the movies. \n\nI should consider societal expectations. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces, even if there are staff. Leaving trash can be seen as inconsiderate, even if someone else will eventually clean it. The argument that there are cleaners might not hold because the cost of labor is high, and reducing their workload could be more efficient. Also, the author's reasoning that the theater can afford it because of current pricing is a bit of a stretch. People are generally expected to follow basic cleanliness norms regardless of cost.\n\nThe friend's reaction indicates that the action was perceived as rude. While the author isn't causing direct harm, the social expectation is to dispose of trash properly. So, the author is probably in the wrong. The answer would be A. But wait, maybe there's a nuance. If the theater is designed for small groups and the staff can handle quick cleanups, maybe it's a minor issue. However, the general social norm still leans towards cleaning up. So, even if the author doesn't feel wrong, the friend's reaction shows that it's a social faux pas. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
