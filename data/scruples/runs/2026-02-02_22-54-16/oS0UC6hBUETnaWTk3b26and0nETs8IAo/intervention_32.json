      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe person says they grew up with a family culture where they didn't throw away stuff in certain public places like mall food courts, football stadiums, and movie theaters. Their friend criticized them after a movie for doing that. The author defends their actions by saying there are people to clean the theaters, the theaters now seat only 30 people (which seems small), and movie tickets are expensive now. They also mention they don't want to be an asshole and are asking if they're wrong.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They think the author isn't, but want my opinion. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). I need to choose between A and B.\n\nFirst, let's break down the arguments. The author's reasoning includes cultural upbringing, the presence of cleaners, the small size of the theaters, and the cost of going to the theater. The friend's perspective is that they should dispose of trash, implying it's a matter of etiquette.\n\nIn terms of social norms, generally, in public places like movie theaters, it's considered polite to clean up after oneself. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are staff to clean up. However, the author is pointing out that the theaters are small, so the cleaning task isn't huge. Also, the cost argument might be a stretch\u2014if someone is paying for the movie, it doesn't directly relate to their responsibility to clean up. The cultural aspect is a personal upbringing point, but social norms can vary. Just because someone was raised a certain way doesn't make it right or wrong by societal standards.\n\nOn the other hand, the author does take their trash out after being called out, which shows they are willing to comply when reminded. That could indicate they aren't being deliberately inconsiderate. However, the fact that they left the trash multiple times (at different places) suggests a habitual behavior, not just a one-time oversight.\n\nThe presence of cleaning staff doesn't negate the etiquette aspect. Even if someone else will clean, it's still polite to leave places tidy for others. It's about considering the environment and the people who come after you. Theaters are shared spaces, and leaving trash might make the experience less pleasant for others.\n\nThe argument about theater size\u201430 seats\u2014might be a bit of a red herring. Even in a small theater, leaving trash around isn't courteous. The number of people doesn't mitigate the responsibility of each individual to clean up.\n\nThe cost of the ticket being high doesn't justify not cleaning up. Paying for a ticket gives access to the service, but doesn't grant the right to be less considerate. It's about respecting the space and others, not about the cost.\n\nSo considering all these points, the general social expectation is to dispose of your own trash in public places like movie theaters. The author's actions go against that norm, even if they were raised differently. The fact that they changed their behavior after being reminded shows they are aware of the norm and can adjust, which is a good sign, but the initial action does cross into being inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong based on standard etiquette, even if their reasoning has some points.\n"
