But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not disposing of their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family's culture was to leave such items in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. A friend criticized them, but the author argues that theaters have staff to clean, and since they now seat only 30 people, it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main points here are about responsibility and etiquette in public spaces. The friend's reaction is based on the expectation that people should clean up after themselves. The author's defense is that there are cleaners and the theaters are small now, but that might not be a valid excuse. Even if there are cleaners, it's generally considered polite to dispose of one's trash properly. Leaving trash around contributes to pollution and extra work for staff, even if they are employed for cleaning. The argument about cost might not justify the behavior either, as paying for a ticket doesn't grant the right to litter.\n\nThe family's culture is mentioned, but that's a cultural norm argument. However, societal expectations in most places today do expect individuals to dispose of their own waste in public spaces. So even if it's a family habit, the broader social norm might be different. The author's friend pointing it out suggests that there's a difference in values here.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author isn't causing massive harm because of the small theater size, the act of not cleaning up is still against general social etiquette. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in this situation.\n"
