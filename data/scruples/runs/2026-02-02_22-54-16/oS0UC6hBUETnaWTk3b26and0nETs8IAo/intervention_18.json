But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The friend chastised them, but the author feels okay because the theater has staff to clean up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user mentions that their family's culture didn't emphasize cleaning up after themselves in public places like malls or stadiums. So maybe it's a generational or regional difference. However, movie theaters are different from stadiums because they're enclosed spaces with more sensitive surfaces. Popcorn and drinks can attract pests or damage seats.\n\nThen there's the aspect of responsibility. Even if there are cleaners, it's considered polite to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving trash can be seen as inconsiderate to others and adds to the cleaners' workload. The author argues that the theaters only seat 30 people now, so cleaning isn't a big task. But that's an assumption; maybe the staff has a larger area to clean beyond just the seating area.\n\nCost is another point. The author mentions that movie tickets are expensive, so maybe they feel it's worth it not to clean up to save time or money. But that's a bit of a stretch. The cost of the ticket doesn't absolve one from proper etiquette.\n\nThe author is also concerned about being an \"asshole.\" The key here is intent. If the person is intentionally not cleaning up to be lazy, that's one thing, but if it's a cultural norm they were raised with, maybe they didn't realize it's considered rude. However, if a friend pointed it out, they might now know it's an issue.\n\nIn modern society, there's a general expectation to clean up after oneself in public places. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash is frowned upon. It's about respect for others and maintaining a clean environment. So the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to this social norm, even if their friend was a bit harsh. The balance here is between personal habits and societal expectations. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) if the user's reasoning is based on prior habits and the existence of cleaners, but some might argue A (in the wrong) because of the broader social expectation to clean up.\n"
