But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that in their family, it was common not to clean up after themselves in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They were scolded by a friend, but they argue that theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go there now. They also don't want to be seen as an asshole, so they're seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's generally expected to clean up after yourself in public spaces, even if there are staff. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate because it adds to the workload of employees and can create a mess for others. However, the author's upbringing might have different expectations, which is a cultural aspect.\n\nThen there's the argument about cleaning staff. The author points out that theaters have people to clean up, so maybe their contribution isn't necessary. But even if staff are there, part of being a considerate public citizen is minimizing the burden on those employees. It's not just about the task being big or small; it's about respect for others' work and maintaining a clean environment.\n\nCost of movie tickets is another point. The author mentions that going to the theater is expensive, so maybe they feel it's their right to not clean up after paying. However, the cost doesn't directly relate to responsibility in public spaces. Paying for a ticket doesn't excuse not following basic social etiquette.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important too. The author was chastised, which suggests that their behavior went against social norms in their friend's view. This could indicate that the author is in the wrong from a social perspective, even if their family's culture is different.\n\nBut the author isn't malicious; they're just following what they were taught. They might not be intentionally being inconsiderate. However, social norms can vary, and in many contexts, cleaning up after oneself is considered polite. So, while the author's intention wasn't to be an asshole, their action might still be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that since there are cleaning staff, the individual's contribution is minimal, and the theater's business model includes cleaning. But that's a bit of a stretch because if everyone left their trash, the workload would be significantly higher, and it's a matter of shared responsibility.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific context. But generally, in most societal norms, leaving trash behind in public places is frowned upon. The author isn't the worst person for it, but they might be in the wrong because of the inconsiderate impact on others and the staff.\n"
