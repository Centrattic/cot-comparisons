But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person says they grew up in a family where they didn't dispose of trash in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. A friend scolded them, but they argue that theaters have cleaning staff and the cost of going to the movies is high. They want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, cleaning up after yourself in public spaces is expected. Movie theaters are usually small, and leaving trash can make the space less comfortable for others. However, the person's background might influence their behavior, so it's not just about right or wrong but societal expectations versus personal habits.\n\nThe author argues that there are cleaners, so maybe it's not a big deal. But if everyone left their trash, the theater would be overwhelmed with waste. Even if each person leaves one cup, with 30 seats, that's 30 cups per showing. Over time, that's a lot. Plus, the cleaners have a job to do, but the responsibility is usually on the patrons to dispose of their own trash.\n\nThe cost argument is interesting. Going to the theater is expensive, but that doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up. It's about respect for shared spaces. The person might not see it as a big issue, but others would. The friend's reaction shows that there's a difference in opinions here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the theater provides trash cans, then using them is the norm. Not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if there are cleaners, it's part of being a good citizen to dispose of your trash properly. The author's reasoning is pragmatic, but the expected behavior is to clean up after oneself. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I should check if there's any nuance. The theater's capacity is 30 people now, which is small, so managing trash is manageable. Still, the expectation remains. The friend's correction is valid, and the author should comply to avoid being seen as an asshole. So the answer leans towards A.\n"
