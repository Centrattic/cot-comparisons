Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person explains that it's part of their family culture to leave trash in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them after the movie, but the person defends their actions by saying there are cleaners and that theaters are now smaller, so it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of going to the cinema.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect. The user's family has a tradition of not cleaning up after themselves in public places. That might be a key point. However, societal norms in many places do encourage cleaning up after oneself to maintain cleanliness and respect for public spaces and workers. Even if there are cleaners, it's generally considered polite and responsible to dispose of your own trash. \n\nThe person argues that theaters now have smaller seating (30 people), implying that the clean-up task isn't burdensome. But that might not be a valid justification. Public spaces rely on everyone contributing to cleanliness. Leaving trash can create more work for staff and contribute to littering, even if there are cleaners. Also, the cost of the movie ticket doesn't absolve someone from their responsibility to clean up; it's a separate issue about respect and consideration.\n\nThe person also says they don't want to be an asshole, which shows they're aware there's a social expectation to dispose of trash. Their friend's criticism is a sign that some people do take issue with it. Even if they don't feel entirely wrong, the act of not cleaning up can be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a shared space where others might be seating after them.\n\nSo the question is whether not cleaning up is objectively wrong. While cultural upbringing might influence behavior, societal norms often prioritize public cleanliness and respect for others' spaces. Therefore, even if the person's reasoning has some validity, the act of not throwing away their trash does place them in the wrong from a broader social perspective. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
