Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions their family's culture where they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls or stadiums but left stuff at movie theaters. Their friend called them out, so they started to throw it away but still feel conflicted. They argue that theaters have people cleaning, and it's expensive to go there, but they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal responsibility and societal norms. The author's actions depend on their upbringing, but the friend's reaction suggests that society expects people to clean up after themselves in theaters. Even if there's cleaning staff, it's generally considered polite to dispose of your own trash to reduce their workload. The argument about expense doesn't negate the expectation of cleanliness. Leaving trash behind could be seen as inconsiderate. So, even if there are cleaners, it's expected by many to take responsibility. The author isn't a total asshole, but they are in the wrong for not following the common courtesy norm.\n"
