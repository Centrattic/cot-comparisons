      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The author mentions that this is a habit from their family's culture, and they do this in places like mall food courts, football stadiums, and movie theaters. A friend scolded them after the movie, but the author argues that there are cleaners in theaters, and since theaters now have smaller capacities (like 30 people), it's not a big task. They also mention the high cost of going to the movies and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Generally, it's considered good etiquette to clean up after oneself, especially in shared spaces. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. However, the author's reasoning includes practical points: smaller theater sizes might mean less waste, and the cost of movies being expensive could imply that people have a right to relax a bit more. But those points don't necessarily justify not cleaning up.\n\nThe key here is societal expectations versus personal convenience. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash can contribute to a messier environment and adds to the workload of those cleaners. The author's friend is pointing out that this behavior is socially unacceptable, which is a common perspective. The author's justification that it's not a big task might not hold because even small contributions from everyone can add up to a significant problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have malicious intent. It's a habit learned from their family, which can be hard to break. However, social norms can vary, and adapting to the expectations of different environments (like a movie theater) might be necessary, especially when others are affected. The author's own admission that they don't want to be an asshole suggests they are aware that their actions might be problematic, even if they don't fully agree.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to clean up after oneself in public places to maintain a clean and pleasant environment for everyone. Theaters, in particular, can get crowded, and leaving trash around can create issues for other patrons as well as staff. The fact that the friend corrected them indicates that this behavior is not universally accepted and there's an expectation to contribute to a clean space.\n\nSo, while the author's reasoning has some points, the general societal expectation is to dispose of trash properly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not following this norm, even if the consequences seem minor. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are not adhering to the expected behavior of cleaning up after themselves in a public setting, regardless of the presence of cleaners or the size of the theater.\n"
