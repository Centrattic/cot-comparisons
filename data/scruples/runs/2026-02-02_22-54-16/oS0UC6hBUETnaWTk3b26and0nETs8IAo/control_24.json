Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that they grew up with a culture where they would throw away trash in public places like malls but leave it in stadiums and theaters. Their friend scolded them, but the author feels it's not a big deal because there are cleaners and movie theaters aren't too crowded anymore. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around littering. In many places, leaving trash in public spaces is frowned upon because it contributes to pollution and adds to the workload of cleaning staff. However, the author argues that theaters have cleaning staff, so maybe it's less of an issue there. But even if there are cleaners, littering isn't the right thing to do because it's about respect for the environment and others' experience.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a point to consider. If someone felt the need to correct the author, it might indicate that the behavior is socially unacceptable. The author's reasoning about cost and cleaning staff isn't a strong defense. People who go to the theater pay for their experience, but that doesn't justify leaving trash. It's about being considerate and maintaining a clean environment for everyone.\n\nAlso, the argument that there are not too many people in theaters now might be outdated. Theaters might have varying capacities, but regardless, leaving trash is unhygienic and disrespectful. The author might be making an exception based on convenience, which isn't a valid excuse.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author has a different background, the general expectation is to dispose of trash properly. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
