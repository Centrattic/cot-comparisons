Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The author mentions their family's culture, not doing it in other places like malls or stadiums, and their friend's disapproval. They also argue that theaters have cleaners and it's expensive to go there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Most public places expect you to clean up after yourself, especially in enclosed spaces like theaters. Leaving trash behind adds to the mess and makes the experience worse for others. Even if there are cleaners, it's a shared responsibility. The cost of the ticket doesn't justify littering. The author's friend is right to point it out because it's a common courtesy. However, the author isn't malicious; they just grew up differently. So, are they in the wrong? It's a judgment call. They might not be a bad person, but the action is inconsiderate. The answer might be A, but there's nuance. Wait, the options are A for yes (wrong) or B for no. Considering that it's a matter of etiquette, not a crime, but the act is still frowned upon. The answer is likely A. But some might say B because intent isn't malicious. Hmm. Theaters do have staff, but that's not an excuse. The right choice is A. So the answer is A.\n"
