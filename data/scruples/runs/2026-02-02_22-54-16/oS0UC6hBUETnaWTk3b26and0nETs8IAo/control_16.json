Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person is from a family culture where they throw away trash in public places like malls and stadiums but left it at the movie theater. Their friend criticized them, and now they're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, movie theaters expect patrons to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The argument is about convenience versus responsibility. The person mentions that theaters seat 30 people now, implying smaller crowds, but that's not a valid excuse because it's still a public space. The cost of going to the theater doesn't justify leaving trash; it's a separate issue. The person also says they don't want to be an asshole, so they might be aware of social expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might come from a different cultural background where leaving trash isn't seen as a big deal. However, in most places, especially in the US, there's an expectation to dispose of trash properly. Theaters rely on cleaning staff, but that doesn't mean customers can leave messes. It's about respect for shared spaces. So, even if there are cleaners, it's better to take personal responsibility. The friend's reaction is a sign that the behavior is socially frowned upon. The person's reasoning doesn't align with common etiquette, so they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
