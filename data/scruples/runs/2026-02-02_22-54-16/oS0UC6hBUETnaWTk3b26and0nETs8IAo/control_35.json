But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspects mentioned. The author says they were raised in a culture where they didn't clean up at places like malls or stadiums. So maybe in their background, it's not seen as a big deal. But their friend called them out, which made them question their actions.\n\nNow, the main point here is whether leaving trash in the theater is wrong. Public spaces generally expect people to clean up after themselves. Even if there are cleaners, it's considered courteous to dispose of your own waste. Theaters, especially with limited seating, might have less space and cleaning can be more frequent. Leaving trash around could create a mess for others or make the cleaners' job harder.\n\nThe author argues that the theaters have people to clean, but that's not really a justification for not doing your part. It's about being considerate. Also, the cost of going to the movies doesn't excuse not cleaning up. The friend's reaction is a social cue that the action might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't being malicious. They just have different habits. But social norms often require adapting to the environment. Even if there's no explicit rule, the expectation is usually to clean up. So while the author isn't a complete jerk for not doing it once, repeatedly not cleaning up could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is that the friend felt the need to point it out, which suggests that it's a social norm they're violating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because not cleaning up is generally considered inconsiderate in public spaces, regardless of personal habits or the presence of cleaners.\n"
