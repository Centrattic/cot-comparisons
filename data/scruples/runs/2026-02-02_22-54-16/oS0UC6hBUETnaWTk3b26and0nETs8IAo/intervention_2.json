Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention their family's culture and that they usually do this in places like malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them, but they now throw away their trash. They argue that theaters have cleaners, aren't too full, and movie tickets are expensive, so maybe it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's expected to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. Theaters might have staff, but that doesn't excuse not doing your part. It's about respect for the environment and others' experience.\n\nThe person's reasoning about cost and family habits isn't a strong defense. Just because others might clean up doesn't mean it's acceptable. Also, habits don't necessarily justify actions if they're harmful. The friend's disapproval suggests that the action is socially frowned upon in some circles. However, the person does acknowledge the feedback and now complies, which shows they're trying to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument that there are cleaners and the theaters aren't too busy might be a valid point. If the space isn't crowded, maybe the impact of leaving trash is minimal. But that's a bit of a slippery slope. Even in less crowded areas, contributing to cleanliness is a good practice.\n\nThe key here is balancing personal habits with community expectations. While the person isn't a complete jerk, the act of not cleaning up can be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they now do clean up might mitigate some blame, but the initial action still has an impact. So, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, considering the norms, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong.\n"
