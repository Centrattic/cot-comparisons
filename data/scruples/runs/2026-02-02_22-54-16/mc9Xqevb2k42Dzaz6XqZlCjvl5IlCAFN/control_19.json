My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as requested by their late father.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad cheated, married the woman after splitting with the mom, and asked the kids to give her an expensive necklace after he died. The stepmom then acted hostile, blocked the family during hospice, shoved the mom, and was rude at the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they promised their dad but are upset about the stepmom's behavior. The friends say to give it and move on, but the author is refusing.\n\nLegally, if the dad gave the necklace to the kids with the intent to give it to the stepmom, the kids might be obligated. But if the dad didn't formalize it (like through a will), it's more of a personal request. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged. The stepmom's actions were hurtful, so the author's resentment is understandable. The dad's wishes are important, but the stepmom's actions might have undermined that request. The author might be protecting themselves from enabling someone who was harmful.\n\nMoral standpoint: It's about honoring the father's last wish vs. giving to someone who was abusive. If the dad truly wanted it given despite her actions, maybe the author should honor that. But if the dad was being manipulated, the author isn't responsible for that. Also, the author's own well-being is a factor\u2014why should they enable someone who harmed their family?\n\nThe stepmom's aggressive behavior (shoving the mom, controlling the funeral) shows she might be untrustworthy. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their family's dignity. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. But considering the stepmom's actions and the dad's possible manipulation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing family and their own peace of mind. So I'd lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
