My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their dad's wife after he passed away. \n\nFirst, the context: The dad cheated on the mom, then married the other woman after the split. The woman tried to cut the family out. Despite this, the dad wanted his kids to give her an expensive necklace after he died. The woman then acted badly during hospice\u2014pretended to want the family around but then excluded them, even physically attacked the mom. After the funeral, she's harassing the author for the necklace, showing she's ungrateful and selfish.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't owe her anything and she didn't deserve the necklace after her actions. The friends suggest giving it up, but the author refuses. The key points here are the dad's last wish versus the stepmom's behavior. \n\nSo, the question is whether honoring the dad's request is an obligation the author must fulfill despite the stepmom's actions. On one hand, the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given, which might be a moral obligation. On the other hand, the stepmom's actions were harmful and manipulative, making the author reluctant. \n\nBut the dad's request was made under the context of his illness and possibly under pressure from the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom's actions post-diagnosis and during hospice suggest she was exploiting him. The author might feel that honoring such a request would enable her further manipulation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is caught between respecting their father's wishes and protecting their family from someone who caused them harm. The stepmom's behavior was malicious, and giving her the necklace could be seen as rewarding her for her actions. However, the author's dad's intent was to give it to her, so denying it might be seen as going against his wishes. \n\nBut considering the circumstances\u2014especially the stepmom's betrayal and the dad's possible compromised decision-making due to illness\u2014the author's decision to withhold the necklace might be justified. The dad's request could have been influenced by the stepmom's manipulation or his guilt. The author's friends advising to give it up might not understand the full context of the stepmom's behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to refuse based on the stepmom's actions. The necklace was a gift, but given the circumstances, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their family's well-being over fulfilling a request made under manipulative conditions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
