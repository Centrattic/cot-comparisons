My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their dad's wife. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. The woman then tried to cut them out, which the dad resisted. After the dad was diagnosed with cancer, he married her and gave the author a necklace to give her after he died. But the wife was really mean during hospice, shoved the mom, kept the author and brother away, and caused a lot of drama at the funeral. Now she's harassing the author to get the necklace.\n\nThe author feels she doesn't deserve it after her actions, even though it was the dad's wish. So the question is whether the author is wrong for not giving it. \n\nFrom one angle, the dad made a request, and the author promised to do it for his sake. But then there's the behavior of the stepmom, which was really hurtful. The author's friends say to just give it and move on, but the author is holding out. \n\nLegally, if the dad had no will or legal documents stating the necklace must be given, the author might have a right to decline. But if it's part of the estate, maybe there's an obligation. However, the story doesn't mention legal aspects. \n\nMorally, the author is conflicted. They honored the dad's wish initially, but the stepmom's actions make them change their mind. The stepmom seems to have taken advantage of the dad, given her behavior. The author is protecting their mom and standing up for themselves. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons to not give the necklace after the stepmom's mistreatment. The dad's request was made under emotional circumstances, and the stepmom's actions show she didn't deserve it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
