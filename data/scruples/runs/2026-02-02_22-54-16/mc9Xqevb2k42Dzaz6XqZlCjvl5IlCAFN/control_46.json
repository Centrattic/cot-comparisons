My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a necklace that was supposed to be given to the stepmother by the author after the father's death. The author is resisting because of the stepmother's bad behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's explicit request. He asked the author to give the necklace to the stepmother, so there's a promise made. But then there's the context of the stepmother's actions: cutting the author and their family out, being abusive, and causing a lot of stress. The stepmother also tried to prevent the family from being with the father at the end and made the funeral about herself.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to just give the necklace and move on. But the author is holding out because of the stepmother's actions. Legally, if the father left instructions in a will or through a legal document, that might be binding. But since it's a personal request, the author might have some discretion. Emotionally and ethically, it's a tough call. The father's last wish versus the stepmother's behavior.\n\nI should think about whether the author is obligated to fulfill the request. If the father didn't put it in a will, maybe the author isn't legally bound. But if it's a moral obligation, the author might feel conflicted. However, given the stepmother's actions, the author's refusal could be justified as self-protection and standing up against mistreatment. Plus, the stepmother is being aggressive in trying to get the necklace, which adds to the tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer might depend on cultural or familial expectations. If the father explicitly asked, some might say the author should honor it. But others might side with the author, given the stepmother's behavior. The key points are the father's intent, the stepmother's actions, and the author's response to pressure. \n\nI think the author's position is understandable. They're protecting themselves and their family from a toxic situation. The stepmother's actions make the necklace a symbol of betrayal, so refusing to give it could be seen as a stand against that. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
