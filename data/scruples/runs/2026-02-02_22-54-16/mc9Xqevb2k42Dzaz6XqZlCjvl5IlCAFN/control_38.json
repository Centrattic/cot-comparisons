My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's dad cheated on their mom, married the other woman, and after his death, the stepmom was difficult, even physically aggressive towards the mom. The dad gave the author an expensive necklace to give to his new wife after he died. The author is now refusing to give it to her because of her behavior, and friends are telling them to just give it up. The author is conflicted and asks if they are in the wrong (AITA).\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let's consider the key points here.\n\n1. **Dad's Request**: The dad explicitly asked the author to give the necklace to his wife after he died. The author agreed \"for his sake.\" So there's a direct request from the father, which in many cultures, especially in situations of dying, can be considered a final wish. The question is whether honoring that wish is a moral obligation.\n\n2. **Stepmom's Actions**: The stepmom was manipulative, tried to cut the family out, physically shoved the mom, and controlled the funeral. The author and their brother felt wronged and are resisting giving the necklace. The stepmom is now being aggressive in trying to get it, even showing up at school. The author's resentment is clear.\n\n3. **Legal vs. Ethical**: Are there any legal implications here? If the necklace was given to the author by the dad, maybe as a gift, then legally it might be the author's to decide. Unless the dad had a will that specified it for the wife, but the story doesn't mention a will. It's a gift given directly to the author, so the author might have the legal right to keep it. Ethically, though, if the dad wanted it given as a final gesture, is the author obligated?\n\n4. **Emotional Context**: The author is dealing with grief and betrayal. The stepmom's actions were harmful, especially towards the mom and during the hospice time. The necklace might be seen as a payment for something the stepmom wasn't entitled to, or as a final act of the dad's goodwill. The author's refusal could be justified as protecting their mom and not rewarding harmful behavior.\n\n5. **Cultural and Family Norms**: In some cultures, fulfilling a parent's last wish is a strong duty. In others, it might be more about personal ethics. The author might feel that honoring a wish made under duress or when the dad was in a weakened state isn't right, especially if the stepmom didn't deserve it. Alternatively, the dad might have wanted to maintain a relationship with her, and the author is respecting that aspect of his wishes.\n\n6. **Friends' Advice**: Friends are telling the author to give it up and move on. This could be based on avoiding conflict, but the author is choosing not to comply. The friends might not understand the extent of the stepmom's behavior.\n\n7. **Moral Rights**: The author's mom was physically assaulted by the stepmom. The author and brother had to confront the stepmom. The moral argument here could be that the stepmom's actions make her undeserving of the gift, so the author isn't in the wrong for withholding it.\n\nPossible angles where the author might be in the wrong: The dad had a final wish, and not honoring it could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the dad's judgment was compromised due to his illness, or if the stepmom's actions were abusive, the author might feel justified in not giving it. The dad's decision to marry the stepmom while unwell might have been influenced by her, leading the author to question the dad's intentions regarding the necklace.\n\nAnother point is whether the necklace was part of the dad's estate. If it was his property, then technically it belongs to the wife as his spouse. But if the dad gave it personally to the author, maybe as a gift to her through them, the author might be the rightful owner and free to decide. The situation is a bit unclear, but the author's perspective is that the dad didn't have to give it to her, and they're not obligated to fulfill a request made under questionable circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. However, considering the stepmom's behavior and the author's justification for not giving it, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They could be protecting their family from an abusive person and not rewarding her actions. The dad's request is conflicting with the stepmom's behavior, so the author's stance is about moral judgment over fulfilling a request that now seems inappropriate given the circumstances.\n"
