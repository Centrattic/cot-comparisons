My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the father had an affair with this woman, and after divorcing the mother, he started living with her. The woman tried to cut out the kids but the dad resisted. Then the dad got cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to the author with instructions to give it to her after he died. The stepmom then acted in a hostile way during the hospice time, physically attacked the mom, and was rude at the funeral. Now, she's demanding the necklace, and the author refuses.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author's dad wanted them to give the necklace, but the stepmom was abusive. The author is holding onto the necklace and not giving it despite friends suggesting they should. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom my understanding, the author is following their father's last wish but is also justified in their anger due to the stepmom's actions. However, the necklace was a gift from the father to the stepmom, so legally, even if the stepmom was abusive, the necklace belongs to her by the father's request. But emotionally, the author is hurt and doesn't want to give it to her. The stepmom's behavior is definitely bad, but the author's refusal might be against their father's wishes.\n\nBut then again, if the necklace was given by the father to the stepmom, maybe the author isn't legally obligated, but there's the moral aspect of honoring the father's wishes. However, the stepmom's actions could be a factor in the author's decision. It's a bit of a conflict between honoring a parent's request and the other parent's behavior.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is morally in the wrong. If the necklace was given by the father as a gift to the stepmom, then maybe the author should give it to her to honor the father's last wishes. But if the stepmom was abusive, maybe the author is justified in not giving it. However, the author did agree to give it for the father's sake, but the stepmom's actions made them change their mind.\n\nIn ethical terms, honoring a parent's wishes is important, but so is protecting oneself from abuse. The author might feel that giving the necklace legitimizes the stepmom's actions. But if the necklace was a gift from the father, keeping it could be seen as going against his last wishes. However, considering the stepmom's behavior, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a tricky situation where there's no clear right or wrong, but I think the author's decision is understandable given the stepmom's actions. The answer might lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
