My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom and married the stepmom. The stepmom tried to cut the family out. After he got cancer, he asked the author to give her an expensive necklace. Then, when he was in hospice, the stepmom lied about his condition and then during the hospice visit, she shoved the author's mom. At the funeral, she was disrespectful. Now she's demanding the necklace.\n\nThe author's friends say to give it and move on, but the author refuses because of everything the stepmom did. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the key points here are the dad's request versus the stepmom's actions. The author was following his dad's wish, but after seeing how the stepmom acted, they feel justified in not giving it. Legally, maybe the dad had the right to give the necklace to the stepmom, so the author might be bound to give it. But morally, considering the stepmom's behavior, the author might feel it's right to withhold it. \n\nBut does the author have the right to go against their dad's last request? Some might say the dad's wishes should be honored regardless of the stepmom's actions. Others might see the stepmom's behavior as so egregious that the author is justified in refusing. \n\nAlso, the stepmom is being aggressive about getting the necklace, which adds to the author's justification. The author's friends are divided, but the author is standing their ground. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, if the dad's will or explicit request was to give the necklace, then the author might be in the wrong. But if it was an informal request without legal binding, the author has more leeway. The story doesn't mention a will, just the dad's verbal request. \n\nEmotionally, the author is hurt by the stepmom's actions. It's possible the dad was manipulated, and the author is protecting their family. The stepmom's behavior (shoving the mom, cutting them out of the funeral) is pretty bad. \n\nSo, putting it all together, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the stepmom's actions were so harmful, and the author is acting in self-preservation and protecting their family's interests, even against their dad's request. The dad's request might have been influenced by manipulation or his illness, so the author isn't necessarily bound to follow it if it's against their family's well-being.\n"
