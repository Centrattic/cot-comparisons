My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for not giving the expensive necklace that their late father wanted them to give to his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The father cheated on the mother, married the other woman, and then died from cancer. He asked the author to give the necklace to his wife after his death. But the wife, referred to as \"this bitch\" in the text, had a hostile behavior towards the author's mother and family during the hospice period. She physically shoved the mother and excluded the family from the funeral, making things very difficult for them.\n\nThe author is holding onto the necklace, not giving it to her despite the father's request. The stepmother is now aggressively trying to get it. The author's friends say to give it and move on, but the author feels justified in keeping it because of the woman's actions. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not. If the father explicitly asked for the necklace to be given, there might be a moral obligation unless there's a legal contest. But morally, it's tricky. The father's last wish vs. the stepmother's actions. The author could feel that honoring the father's request would enable the woman's behavior, especially if she's exploiting the situation. \n\nThe stepmother's behavior was\u6076\u52a3\u2014physical assault on the mother, excluding the family, and making the funeral about herself. The author might perceive that the father was manipulated by her, and giving the necklace would be supporting someone who caused so much harm. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should respect their father's final wishes regardless of the circumstances. However, given the abuse and the father's possible manipulation by the wife, the author might feel they are protecting their father's legacy by not fulfilling a request made under duress. \n\nAlso, the necklace is expensive, so it's a significant item. The author might not trust the stepmother to have honorable intentions with it. The fact that she's harassing the author for it now adds to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a personal decision. The author is dealing with grief and betrayal. Their stance is that the stepmother didn't deserve the necklace after how she acted. Friends are conflicted, but the author's perspective is clear. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons to prioritize their family's well-being over the stepmother's demands, especially given the abuse and manipulation.\n"
