My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmom after their dad passed away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The key points are: the dad cheated, married the stepmom, gave her a necklace to be given after his death. The stepmom then acted poorly towards the author's family, including shoving the mom and cutting them out of the funeral. Now, the stepmom is pressuring the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to give the necklace because of the stepmom's actions, despite it being the dad's request. The friends are split, some saying to give it and move on. The author feels justified in refusing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, the dad asked for the necklace to be given to the stepmom. The author might be bound by that request, unless there's a legal claim otherwise. But emotionally and ethically, the author is hurt and doesn't trust the stepmom. The stepmom's behavior was abusive and manipulative.\n\nConsidering the dad's intentions: he might have genuinely wanted the stepmom to have the necklace, but he was also in his final days, possibly more susceptible to manipulation. However, the stepmom seems to have exploited his illness to gain control.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on protecting their own and family's well-being. The stepmom's actions were harmful, and giving her the necklace could enable further manipulation. The author is standing up for themselves against someone who has been abusive.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not obligated to fulfill a request that came from someone who was being taken advantage of. The dad's wishes might have been clouded by the stepmom's influence. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their family's interests over an expensive gift to someone who caused harm.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting themselves and honoring their dad by not enabling the stepmom's behavior. The correct answer is B.\n"
