My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom and started living with this woman. The woman tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in touch. Then he got cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to her through the author before dying. The stepmother then acted really poorly during his final days, even physically shoving the mom and cutting the family out of the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace back, and the author is refusing.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give it up and move on, but they feel justified in keeping it. The key points here are the dad's last wish versus the stepmother's actions. Legally, if the dad instructed the author to give the necklace, there might be an obligation. But morally, considering the stepmother's behavior, the author might feel justified in not giving it. \n\nThe stepmother's actions\u2014physically attacking the mom, cutting off the family, and being disrespectful at the funeral\u2014paint her as someone who took advantage of the dad. The author's refusal could be seen as protecting their family's interests, given her behavior. However, the dad's dying wish complicates things. But if the stepmother didn't honor his wishes in his final moments (like not allowing the mom to visit), maybe the author feels justified in not honoring her now. \n\nThe author isn't legally bound unless there's a legal document, but the moral question is about respect for the dad's wishes versus protecting family from harm. Since the stepmother was manipulative and hurtful, the author might not be in the wrong for withholding the necklace. The friends' advice to give it up might be about avoiding conflict, but the author's stance is about principle. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
