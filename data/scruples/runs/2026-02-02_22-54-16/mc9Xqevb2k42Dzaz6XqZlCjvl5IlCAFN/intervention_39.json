My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not giving the expensive necklace as per their father's request. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, then married her shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. He asked the author to give the necklace to his new wife after he died. However, the wife acted hostile, pushed the mom, and tried to exclude them from the funeral. The author is now refusing to hand over the necklace because of her actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's request versus the stepmother's behavior. The author feels that the stepmother wasn't deserving due to her actions. Legally, if the necklace was part of the father's estate, there might be some obligation, but if it was a personal gift, maybe not. But the author might feel a moral obligation to honor their dad's last wish, but then again, the stepmother's behavior was abusive.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's dilemma is between respecting their father's wishes and protecting their mother and themselves from a bad situation. The stepmother's actions were clearly harmful, so the author's refusal could be seen as justified. The friends advising to give it up might not consider the emotional abuse involved. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their family after witnessing mistreatment. The father's request was made under the circumstances, but the stepmother's actions nullify any obligation the author might feel. So, the answer is B.\n"
