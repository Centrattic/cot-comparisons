My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's dad cheated on his wife (the author's mom) with this woman. After the divorce, dad started living with the other woman, who tried to cut the family out. The dad later got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Before dying, he married the woman and gave the author an expensive necklace to give her, saying she \"deserved\" it. The author agreed for his sake.\n\nThen, during the hospice period, the woman lied about allowing the author's mom to visit, leading to a confrontation where she shoved the mom. At the funeral, she excluded the family and focused on herself. Now, she's demanding the necklace, but the author refuses, feeling she doesn't deserve it after her actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments for and against.\n\nArguments for the author (B):\n- The woman cheated and then acted spitefully, causing harm to the family. The author feels justified in not giving the necklace because she doesn't believe the woman deserves it. The dad's request was made under emotional pressure before death, maybe not fully aware of her true nature. The author is protecting their mom and themselves from a toxic person.\n- The woman's actions during the hospice and funeral were harmful. She took advantage of the dad, and the author is standing up for their family's dignity.\n\nArguments against the author (A):\n- The dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given as his last wish. Honoring that request could be seen as respecting his wishes, even if the woman is difficult. The author might face legal issues if the necklace was a gift to the woman, especially if the dad had the mental capacity to make such a decision. The author's refusal might cause additional grief or conflict, as friends suggest washing their hands of it.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, then the author might have an obligation to deliver it. But if the dad's mental state was compromised due to illness, there might be a case to challenge the gift. However, the author might not want to get into a legal battle. Emotionally, the author is justified in their anger and desire to protect their mom, but the ethical side is tricky because fulfilling the dad's request could be seen as respecting his final wishes.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people often side with the person who's standing up for themselves against someone who's clearly in the wrong. The woman's behavior was\u6076\u52a3, and the author's refusal could be seen as protecting their family's well-being. However, the dad's request complicates things because of the final wishes aspect. But given the woman's actions, maybe the author's prioritization of their family's peace is more important.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The woman's actions were harmful, and the author's decision not to give the necklace is a form of standing up against her mistreatment. The dad's request might have been influenced by his desire to maintain the relationship, but the author is right to protect their family.\n"
