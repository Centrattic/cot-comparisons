My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad cheated on the mom with the stepmom. After splitting up, the dad started living with her, and she tried to cut the family out. The dad later got cancer, married her, and gave the author a necklace to give her after his death. However, when the dad was dying, the stepmom kept the family from being with him, shoved the author's mom, and was hostile. Post-funeral, she's been pushy for the necklace.\n\nSo the author refuses to give it, and friends are telling him to give it and cut ties. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to evaluate based on the situation. The dad's wish was for the necklace to go to his stepmom, but the stepmom's behavior is clearly negative. The author's reasons for not giving it are because of her actions, which hurt the family. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel justified in not giving it due to her poor treatment of the family. However, technically, he gave his word to his dad. But considering the stepmom's actions, maybe the dad's request was manipulated or not in the best interest of the family. \n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift specified in the dad's will, the author might be obligated. But since it's not clear if there's a legal document, it's more about personal promise. However, if the stepmom's behavior was abusive and the dad was possibly under her influence, the author might have grounds to not fulfill the request.\n\nEmotionally, the author is protecting his family from someone who harmed them. The stepmom's pushy behavior adds to the tension. Friends advising to give it and move on might be trying to avoid conflict, but the author's stance is about justice for his family.\n\nIn these types of situations, often the person's actions are influenced by betrayal and harm. If the stepmom was manipulative, the author's refusal could be seen as protecting his family's interests. The dad's last wish is complicated by his possibly declining mental state due to illness, which might affect the validity of the request.\n\nThus, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's standing up for his family against someone who mistreated them. The necklace was a request under circumstances that might not have been entirely the dad's own will. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
