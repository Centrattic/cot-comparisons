My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's dad cheated on his wife, then married the other woman. After he got cancer, he asked his kids to give this expensive necklace to his new wife. But the wife was mean to the family, kept them from seeing him at the end, shoved the mom, and was rude at the funeral. Now she's pestering the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author is holding onto the necklace and doesn't want to give it because of her behavior. Friends are saying to just give it and forget, but the author isn't budging. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the dad's request was for the kids to give the necklace. The author agreed for his sake. But after seeing the wife's actions, they're not going through with it. There's a conflict between honoring the dad's last wish and protecting the family from someone who was abusive.\n\nLegally, if the dad had a will or legally transferred ownership, maybe the necklace is hers. But the story doesn't mention that. The author might have a moral right to keep it given her actions. Also, the wife's behavior was hostile and harmful. The author's decision could be seen as protecting their family's well-being and not enabling someone who was abusive.\n\nBut the dad's wish is a factor. However, the author might feel that honoring the wish isn't worth enabling a harmful person. The friends say to give it up, but that might be to avoid conflict. However, the author's actions are justified if they believe the wife doesn't deserve it after her actions. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
