My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as requested by their late father. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom, married the other woman (stepmom) after the split, and gave the author a necklace to give to the stepmom after his death. The stepmom then acted hostile, tried to cut the family out, and was rude at the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace, and the author refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's request versus the stepmom's behavior. The author is caught between honoring their dad's last wish and dealing with the stepmom's actions. The friends are telling them to give the necklace and move on, but the author feels justified in not giving it.\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, keeping a promise to a deceased parent might be seen as important. However, the stepmom's behavior complicates things. The stepmom shoved the mom, kept the family away, and was disrespectful. The author's refusal could be seen as a stand against the stepmom's mistreatment of the family.\n\nAlso, the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, so legally, the author might not have a claim over it. But the author's moral stance is that the stepmom didn't deserve it because of her actions. The author's friends suggest giving it to avoid conflict, but the author feels that giving it would be enabling the stepmom's behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If we prioritize fulfilling the father's wish, maybe yes. But if we consider the stepmom's actions and the author's right to protect their family and not support someone who harmed them, then no. The author's decision is based on the stepmom's mistreatment and their own moral judgment. The father's request is in the context of his relationship with the stepmom, which the author may not fully endorse now that they see how she treated the family. \n\nIn many cases, people might side with the author, especially when the recipient has been abusive. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their family and not allowing someone who caused harm to benefit. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
