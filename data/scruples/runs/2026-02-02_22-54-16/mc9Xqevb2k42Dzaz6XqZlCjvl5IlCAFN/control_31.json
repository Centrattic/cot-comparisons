My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not giving the expensive necklace to their dad's wife as requested. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad cheated on their mom, then married the other woman after their mom left. The stepmom, or maybe girlfriend, tried to cut out the family but the dad stayed in touch. After the dad got cancer, he asked the author to give her the necklace after he died. Then, when the dad was in hospice, the stepmom didn't let the family and their mom see him properly, even pushing the mom. At the funeral, she made it about herself and continued to pressure the author for the necklace.\n\nSo, the author is refusing to give the necklace because of the stepmom's actions. The question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nThe dad's last wish was to give her the necklace, but the stepmom's behavior was terrible. The author feels justified in not giving it because she hurt their family. The friends advised them to give it and move on, but they don't want to. \n\nLegally, if the dad asked them to give it, maybe they are bound by his request. However, if the necklace was his property, maybe they have the right to decide against it, especially if there's no legal obligation. Emotionally, the author is hurt and doesn't trust the stepmom. The stepmom was using the dad and cutting them off. \n\nThere's a conflict between respecting a loved one's last request and protecting oneself from someone harmful. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation. Since there's no indication that the dad made a legal or binding request (like a will), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect themselves and not honor a request that now seems to serve someone who was abusive.\n\nSo, considering the emotional trauma and the stepmom's actions, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the necklace. The answer is B.\n"
