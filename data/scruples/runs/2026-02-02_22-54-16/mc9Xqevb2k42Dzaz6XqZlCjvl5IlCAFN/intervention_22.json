My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves their father's request to give an expensive necklace to his wife after his death, but the wife (the stepmom) acted poorly, cutting out the family and causing conflict. The author is refusing to give her the necklace now.\n\nFirst, the father's wish: he asked the author to give the necklace to his wife. The author agreed for his sake. That's a key point. But the wife's actions post-diagnosis were pretty bad\u2014lying about hospice, preventing the author's mom from seeing him, physically shoving her, and being rude at the funeral. The wife's behavior seems malicious.\n\nThe necklace was a gift the father wanted to give, but the wife's actions suggest she might be using the father's request to get the item. The author is conflicted between honoring the father's last wish and not rewarding someone who was abusive. \n\nLegally, if the father owned the necklace, he could have given it to the wife, but the question is about moral/ethical responsibility. The author might feel that giving the necklace would validate the wife's actions. Also, the wife is harassing the author now, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe author's friends are advising to give it up, but the author feels justified in not doing so. The wife's behavior indicates she's self-serving, so giving her the necklace could enable further bad behavior. The father's request was made under the assumption that the wife was a good person, but the author's experience shows otherwise. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't legally bound to give the necklace unless the father's will specified it. Since the father didn't make it part of the will, the author has the right to decide. Morally, honoring a dying wish is important, but if the recipient is abusive, it's a gray area. The wife's actions might have broken the trust, making the author's refusal understandable. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because the wife's behavior was harmful, and giving her the necklace would be enabling her. The father's request was based on his perception, which was influenced by the wife's manipulation. The author's choice to protect their family's well-being is reasonable."
