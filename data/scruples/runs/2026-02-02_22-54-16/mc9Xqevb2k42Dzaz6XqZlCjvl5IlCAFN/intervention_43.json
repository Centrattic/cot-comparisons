My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's dad cheated on their mom, then married this woman. The dad asked the author to give the necklace to his wife after he died. But the wife treated the author, their mom, and brother really badly\u2014like shoving the mom, keeping them from the hospice visit, cutting them out of the funeral, and being rude. Now the wife is harassing the author to get the necklace.\n\nSo the author is holding onto the necklace and refusing to give it, feeling justified because of the wife's behavior. Their friends are telling them to just give it up, but the author won't. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace despite their dad's request.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the dad explicitly asked to give the necklace to his wife, there might be an obligation. But since it was a personal request, not a legal one, the author might not be legally bound. Ethically, it's trickier. The stepmother was abusive and manipulative. The author's dad might have been under her influence when he made the request, especially given the circumstances after their marriage. The author's main concern is protecting their mom and brother from further harm, which is understandable.\n\nAlso, the wife's actions\u2014shoving the mom, cutting them out of the funeral\u2014show a pattern of control and disrespect. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up against abuse. The dad's last wish is conflicting, but if the wife used him to get the necklace, the author might feel justified in not fulfilling it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that honoring the dad's final request is important, regardless of the stepmother's actions. But given the context of her harmful behavior, the author's stance seems reasonable. They might have a duty to protect their family from further exploitation rather than comply with a request made under manipulation. \n\nI think the key points are the wife's abusive actions and the dad's possible manipulation. The author isn't in the wrong for not giving the necklace.\n"
