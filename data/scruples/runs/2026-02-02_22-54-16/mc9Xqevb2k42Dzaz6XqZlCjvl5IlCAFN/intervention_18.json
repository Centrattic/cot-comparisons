My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to his stepmother as requested by his late father.\n\nFirst, the context: the dad cheated on the author's mom, married the woman (stepmom), who then tried to cut the family out. The dad, during his terminal illness, asked the author to give the necklace to her. However, the stepmom was hostile during the dad's last moments, pushed the mom, and excluded the family from the funeral. Now, she's pressuring the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that due to the stepmom's actions, he doesn't feel obligated to fulfill his dad's last wish. His friends suggest giving it to her, but he refuses. The key points here are the dad's wishes versus the stepmom's behavior.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, the author might be obligated to deliver it. However, if it's the author's possession (maybe he bought it, or it's part of his inheritance), the situation changes. But the scenario says the dad gave it to the author to give to her, so maybe it's a bequest. If there's no legal will, the author could be bound by his dad's request. But morally, the stepmom's actions are questionable. She mistreated the family, which might affect the author's duty to honor the request.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling betrayed. The stepmom's actions during the hospice and funeral were harmful. The author might feel that honoring her would be rewarding her bad behavior. However, the dad's explicit wish complicates it. The author could be seen as respecting his dad's wishes despite the stepmom's actions, but maybe the dad was in a vulnerable state and was being manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepmom is persistently trying to get the necklace, which could indicate she values it, but her actions don't endear her to the author. The author's refusal is a form of self-preservation and protecting his family's feelings.\n\nSo, legally, if the dad's request was part of his dying wishes (and assuming he had the right to do so), the author might be in a tight spot. But morally, given the stepmom's behavior, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The friends' advice to give it and move on might be practical, but the author's emotional stance is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the stepmom's actions and the dad's compromised state (under pressure from her) might have influenced the request, and the author is justified in protecting his family's interests over fulfilling a potentially manipulated wish.\n"
