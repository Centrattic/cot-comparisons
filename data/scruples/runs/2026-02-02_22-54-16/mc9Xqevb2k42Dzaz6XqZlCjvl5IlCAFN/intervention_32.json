My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author's dad cheated on their mom, then married the other woman (let's call her StepMom) after the split. The StepMom tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. After getting pancreatic cancer, the dad gave the author an expensive necklace for the StepMom, asking them to give it after he passed. The author agreed for his sake. \n\nThen, when the dad was in hospice, StepMom didn't let the author's mom see him, had a physical altercation with her, and kicked them out. At the funeral, she excluded the family and mocked the mom and their previous marriage. Now, the StepMom is harassing the author for the necklace, and the author refuses to give it, causing friends to suggest giving it to her but the author is against it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad's final request was to give the necklace. The author promised that, but there's the context of StepMom's behavior. The StepMom's actions were harmful: shoving the mom, excluding the family, and being disrespectful at the funeral. The author's refusal is based on the StepMom's mistreatment and feeling she didn't deserve it.\n\nLegal perspective: If the dad asked to give the necklace, the author might be bound by that request. But if it's a gift to StepMom, the author might not own it. However, the author might have the right to refuse if the gift was conditional on certain behaviors, but that's complicated. Legally, if the dad gave it to the author to pass on, the author might have to honor that. But morally?\n\nMoral perspective: The StepMom's actions were abusive and harmful. The dad's request was made under the belief that she deserved it, but she exploited him. The author's decision to not give the necklace could be seen as standing up against her mistreatment. The friends suggest giving it to cut ties, but the author isn't convinced.\n\nThe key points are the dad's request vs. the StepMom's behavior. The author's obligation to honor the request versus their right to protect their family. The StepMom's actions might nullify the dad's wish, but that's subjective. Legally, the author might be in the wrong if they don't give it, but morally, it's understandable.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not legal. The user is asking for a societal judgment. In AITA terms, the answer often hinges on intent and context. The author's reasoning is that the StepMom didn't deserve it after her actions, and the dad's request was based on a flawed understanding. The author's refusal is a reaction to protecting their family's well-being and respecting their dad's true legacy, despite his request.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, if someone is protecting their family from a harmful individual and the request is based on the harm done, the person is often seen as not being in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
