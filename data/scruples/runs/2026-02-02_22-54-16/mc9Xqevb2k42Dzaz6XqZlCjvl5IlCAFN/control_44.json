My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not giving the necklace to their stepmom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The dad cheated, married the stepmom, and asked the author to give her an expensive necklace. The stepmom then acted really badly during the dad's illness and funeral. The author refuses to give the necklace because of her actions.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's request versus the stepmom's behavior. The author is torn between fulfilling their dad's last wish and standing up against the stepmom's treatment of their mom. The stepmom even physically shoved the mom, which is a big red flag. \n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give the necklace and move on, but the author is justified in feeling upset. The stepmom's actions during the hospice and funeral were inconsiderate and harmful. The dad's request was made while he was sick, possibly under the influence of the stepmom's manipulation. \n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad, the author might be expected to honor that. But considering the circumstances, the author's refusal is more about protecting their mom and not enabling the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom's actions (lying about hospice, refusing family access, physical aggression) are serious. \n\nThe author's decision to not give the necklace could be seen as a stand against the stepmom's mistreatment, even if it means going against their dad's wish. However, the dad's request complicates things. But given the stepmom's behavior, the author's choice is more about justice and protecting their family, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the stepmom's actions were egregious, and the author is justified in not giving the necklace to someone who caused so much harm.\n"
