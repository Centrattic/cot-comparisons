My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a daughter who was asked by her dying father to give an expensive necklace to his new wife after his death. However, the stepmom treated the family really badly, including physically shoving the author's mom, keeping them from the hospice, and making the funeral about herself. The author is now refusing to give the necklace and is getting pressure from friends to do so. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The father made a request, but the stepmom's actions were abusive. The author's main argument is that she's not giving the necklace because of the mistreatment. The friends are saying to give it and move on, but the author is standing her ground.\n\nLegally, if the father left the necklace in his will or specifically asked, the daughter might have an obligation. But if he didn't formalize it, maybe she isn't legally bound. Morally, it's more complex. The father's request was made while he was dying, possibly under the influence of the stepmom's manipulation. The stepmom's behavior was abusive, which could affect the daughter's decision.\n\nThe daughter agreed to do it for her dad's sake, but after seeing how the stepmom acted, she's justified in reevaluating. The stepmom's actions suggest she might not deserve the gift, given how she treated the family. The daughter is protecting her mother and herself from further harm. Friends might think she should honor the request, but the context of the stepmom's behavior complicates that.\n\nSo, considering the abuse and manipulation, the daughter's refusal is understandable. The father's request might have been influenced by the stepmom, and the daughter isn't obligated to fulfill it if it goes against her values and well-being. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
