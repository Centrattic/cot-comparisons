My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's dad cheated on their mom with another woman. After the split, the dad started living with this woman. She tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. Then, the dad got cancer, married the woman, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give her after he died. The author agreed to do this for his sake.\n\nBut when the dad was in hospice, the woman kept the family in the dark and even attacked the author's mom. The family was treated poorly at the hospice, and the funeral was a mess with the woman badmouthing the mom. The author refuses to give the necklace now, and friends are telling him to just give it and forget, but he's holding out.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not giving the necklace?\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author kept his promise to his dad, who asked for the necklace to be given. But on the other hand, the stepmom's actions were abusive and hurtful. The dad's last wishes were to honor her, but her behavior suggests she didn't deserve it. The author could be protecting his family's interests and avoiding further harm by not giving the necklace. \n\nThe dad might have been under manipulation when he made the request, especially given the woman's controlling behavior. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for his mom and themselves. However, fulfilling his dad's request was agreed upon, so there's a sense of duty there.\n\nBut considering the woman's actions, maybe the dad was being used. The author's decision to not give the necklace might be justified as protecting his family from her. The value of the necklace is high, and giving it to someone who's been harmful could be seen as enabling her. The friends' advice might be well-meaning, but the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether honoring his dad's last request outweighs the harm caused by the stepmom. Since the stepmom acted maliciously, the author's choice to withhold the necklace seems reasonable. The dad's intentions might have been overridden by her manipulative behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
