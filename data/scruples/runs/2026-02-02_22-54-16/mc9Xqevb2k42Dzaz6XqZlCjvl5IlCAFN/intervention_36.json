My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as requested by their late father. The scenario is pretty intense. So the dad cheated, married the mistress, and asked the kids to give her an expensive necklace after he died. Then the mistress tried to cut the family out, had a conflict with the mom, and is now harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's request. The author agreed to give the necklace for his sake, but after witnessing the mistress's behavior, they changed their mind. The key points here are the father's explicit wish versus the mistreatment the family faced. The author's friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they feel justified in not doing so because of the mistress's actions.\n\nLegal perspective: If the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given, and there's no will or legal document stating that, then the kids aren't legally obligated. But maybe there's a moral obligation. However, the mistress's behavior complicates things. She was abusive towards the mom and excluded the family during hospice. The author's decision could be seen as protecting their family's well-being.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to comply with a request that now feels like enabling abuse. The mistress's harassment adds pressure, but the author has the right to prioritize their mental health and family bonds.\n\nSome might argue that honoring the father's last wish is important, but if the father was under duress or manipulated by the mistress, the request might not be valid. Also, the necklace is a symbol of the father's final wishes, but the circumstances have changed drastically.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has to balance respect for their dad's wishes against protecting their family. Since the dad was dying and possibly under the influence of the mistress's manipulations, the request might not be a true reflection of his wishes. The author's actions are in response to clear mistreatment, so it's understandable they wouldn't follow through.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to not give the necklace after the mistreatment and their father's potential manipulation. The answer should be B.\n"
