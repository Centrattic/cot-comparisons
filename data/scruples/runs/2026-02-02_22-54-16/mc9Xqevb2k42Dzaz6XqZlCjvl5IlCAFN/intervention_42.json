My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, and after the split, the woman tried to cut the family out. The dad married her despite the illness. He gave the author the necklace to give to her after his death. But then, during hospice, the stepmom didn't let the mom in, shoved her, forced the kids to leave, and was rude at the funeral. The author refuses to give the necklace now because of her behavior.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the stepmom used the dad and hurt the family, so he doesn't feel obligated to give her the necklace. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the dad was clear in his request, so honoring that might be seen as respecting his wishes. But on the other hand, the stepmom's actions were abusive and disrespectful. The author is protecting his mom and family, and the stepmom was the one being hostile. The necklace was a gift, but the author didn't promise to give it under all circumstances\u2014just for the dad's sake. Now, after the stepmom's behavior, he's justified in not giving it because she doesn't deserve it, considering her actions. \n\nI think the key points are the stepmom's malicious behavior versus the dad's final request. The author is acting in self-preservation and protecting his family. The dad's request was made in good faith, but the stepmom's actions reveal her true intentions. The author isn't bound by a legal obligation, just a personal promise, which can be reconsidered given the circumstances. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
