My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the author's dad cheated on his mom with another woman, who then moved in with him. After the dad got cancer, he married this woman and gave the author an expensive necklace to give to her after his death. But then, when the dad was in hospice, the wife kept cutting the family out, even pushing the author's mom and causing a fight. The funeral was a mess, and now the wife is demanding the necklace, which the author is refusing to give.\n\nFirst, the dad's request was to give the necklace to his wife, but the author is holding onto it. The author is upset because of how the wife treated the family, especially the mom. The wife's actions during the hospice and funeral were terrible, and the author doesn't feel responsible to honor her. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author agreed to give the necklace for their dad's sake. However, the wife's behavior made it clear she wasn't deserving, in the author's view. So the dilemma is between respecting the dad's last wish versus standing up to a manipulative stepmother. \n\nLegally, if the dad owned the necklace, he could have given it to her in his will or during his lifetime. If he didn't specify through legal means, the author might not be obligated. But morally, it's tricky. The dad wanted the necklace given, but the wife's actions were abusive. The author might feel justified in not giving it because of her manipulative behavior. \n\nFriends are telling the author to give it and move on, but the author is choosing not to. The key points here are the dad's intent versus the wife's actions. The author might not be in the wrong because the wife's behavior was hurtful, and the dad might not have fully realized her true nature. Plus, the necklace was a gift the dad gave to the wife, not to the author. The author isn't legally bound to hand it over unless it was specified in a will or agreement. So, morally, the author's decision not to give it could be seen as justified given the circumstances. So, the answer is B.\n"
