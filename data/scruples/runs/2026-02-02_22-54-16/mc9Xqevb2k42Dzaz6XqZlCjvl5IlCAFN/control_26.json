My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The story is pretty complicated. The user's dad cheated on their mom with this woman, then married her. The woman tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. After he got cancer, he gave the author a valuable necklace to give to his new wife after he died. But then, during hospice, the wife acted like she agreed to let the author's mom see him, but then blocked her and even shoved the mom. The author shoved her back. The funeral was a mess with the wife cutting them out. Now the wife is harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nSo the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not giving the necklace. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad asked the author to give the necklace. But the wife's actions were really bad\u2014physically aggressive, cutting the family out, making the funeral about herself. The author feels they don't owe her anything. Friends say to give it and move on, but the author refuses.\n\nLegally, if the dad gave the necklace to the wife as a gift, then maybe the author is supposed to hand it over. But if the dad owned it and said to give it, then the author is following his request. However, the wife's behavior adds a moral dimension. The author might feel morally justified in not giving it because of the wife's actions. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the dad explicitly asked for it, then technically they might be in the wrong for not fulfilling the request, unless the wife's behavior makes it clear that the dad was being manipulated, but the author isn't sure about that. The dad's intentions could have been genuine, even if the wife is a bad person. However, the author's perspective is that the wife was using the dad, so maybe the dad's request was influenced by her. The author might be protecting their family's interests over the wife's.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people might side with the author given the wife's behavior. The necklace is a gift from a deceased parent, but if the recipient was abusive, then the family might feel justified in withholding it. However, if the dad wanted to give it, the author's refusal could strain their family's reputation or relationships. But the author's friends are divided on it.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's actions were abusive and the author is protecting their family. Alternatively, if the dad's wishes are paramount regardless of the recipient's behavior, then A. But given the context, the author's stance is more about protecting their family and not enabling the wife's actions, so B makes sense.\n"
