My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their dad's wife as requested. The options are A (yes they are in the wrong) or B (no they aren't).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad cheated on their mom, married the other woman after the split, and then got cancer. Before dying, he asked the author to give an expensive necklace to his new wife and to be nice to her. However, the wife acted cruelly during the hospice time, pushed the author's mom, and was controlling at the funeral. Now, the wife is pressuring the author to give her the necklace, but the author refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad's last request vs. the wife's behavior. The author feels justified in not giving the necklace because of how the wife treated them. The wife is being aggressive and seems to have taken advantage of the dad. The author's friends suggest giving it to her to avoid conflict, but the author is against it.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. Was the author obligated to fulfill their dad's request, or does the wife's behavior override that obligation? The dad might have been under the impression that the wife was deserving, but the author knows she wasn't. The author's decision is based on protecting their mom and standing against the wife's harmful actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because they are honoring their dad's memory by not supporting the wife after her actions. The wife's behavior was abusive, so the author is protecting their family. On the other hand, if the dad explicitly asked for the necklace, there's a case for fulfilling that wish. But given the wife's actions, it's a matter of balancing respect for the dad's wishes against the wife's mistreatment.\n\nIn many similar cases, when someone's request is made under the influence of a manipulative person, others might feel justified in not following through, especially if it's harmful. The author's stance is about justice for their family. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
