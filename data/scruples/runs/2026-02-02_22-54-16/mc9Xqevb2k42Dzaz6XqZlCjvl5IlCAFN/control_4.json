My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as per their father's request. The situation is complex with a lot of emotional and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the father's request. He asked his son to give the necklace to his wife after passing. There's a legal angle here. If the necklace was a gift from the father to his wife, then the son might not legally own it. However, if it was given to the son with the intent for him to pass it on, then the son has a moral obligation unless there are legal issues.\n\nBut the wife's behavior complicates things. She allegedly pushed the mother out of the father's life, physically assaulted her, and excluded the family from the funeral. The son felt she didn't deserve the necklace after her actions. The father's request was made before he got sick, and maybe he didn't realize the extent of her behavior. The son might be protecting his mother and honoring his father's true intentions by withholding the necklace.\n\nThe friends are advising to give it and cut ties, but the son's stance is about justice for his mother and not enabling the wife's demands. Legally, if the father owned the necklace and gifted it to the wife, the son might have to give it. But if the son was the legal owner and the father's request was a moral one, then the son isn't obligated. The wife's harassment (calling, visiting school) adds pressure, but the son's decision not to comply could be seen as standing up against her.\n\nEthically, the son's actions are a conflict between honoring his father's last wish and protecting his family from a harmful person. The father's marriage might have been a regrettable decision, and the son is acting in his mother's best interest. The wife's actions post-father's death are questionable, suggesting she's exploiting the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the son isn't in the wrong. The father's request is overridden by the wife's malicious actions, and the son is protecting his family. The legal aspect is unclear, but ethically, the son's choice to not give the necklace is justified.\n"
