My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their dad's wife after he passed away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The dad cheated on the mom with this woman, and after the split, the dad continued to see her. The wife here, the stepmom, tried to cut the family out but the dad stayed in their lives. When he got cancer, he married her, then gave her the necklace through the author, asking them to give it. However, during hospice and after, the stepmom acted poorly: keeping the family in the dark, being rude, shoving the mom, and excluding the family from the funeral. Now she's harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nSo the author is holding onto the necklace, refusing to give it because of her behavior. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nLegally, if the dad explicitly asked them to give it, and it's his property, then maybe the author is supposed to honor that. But emotionally, the stepmom's actions were abusive and hurtful. The author's friends are telling them to give it and move on, but the author is standing their ground.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's last wish vs. the stepmom's actions. The author might feel that honoring the dad's request is important, but the stepmom's behavior makes it hard. There's also the aspect of emotional harm and the stepmom's manipulative behavior. \n\nIn such cases, people often consider intent. The dad might have been influenced by the stepmom, or maybe he genuinely wanted to give it despite her actions. But the stepmom's actions post-death suggest she's only interested in possessions, not the relationship. \n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as justified if the necklace was a result of coercion or if the dad was being taken advantage of. However, if the dad was in a right state of mind and made a clear request, there's a moral obligation. But given the stepmom's behavior, the author might feel it's not worth going through the hassle or enabling her further.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author isn't legally bound unless the dad had formal instructions. Since it's a personal item and the stepmom's actions were harmful, the author's choice to not give it could be justified as protecting their family and honoring their dad's memory properly. Friends might think it's easier to give it to avoid conflict, but the author's stance is about respecting the dad's true wishes while considering the stepmom's behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
