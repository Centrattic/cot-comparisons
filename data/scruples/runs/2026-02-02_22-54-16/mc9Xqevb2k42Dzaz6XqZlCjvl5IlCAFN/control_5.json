My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their stepmother. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom and married the stepmother when he was dying. He gave the author a necklace to give to the stepmother after he passed. The stepmother then acted poorly, kept the family out of hospice care, physically assaulted the mom, disrupted the funeral, and is now harassing the author to get the necklace.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the stepmother didn't deserve the necklace due to her actions, and they don't want to give it to her. The friends say to just give it and forget, but the author is holding out.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the dad had a will that specified the necklace to the stepmother, the author might be obligated. But the story doesn't mention a will. The dad gave the necklace verbally as a request, not a legal document. So legally, maybe not in the wrong. \n\nEthically, the stepmother's behavior was awful. She was abusive, manipulative, and hurt the family. The dad's request was based on his feelings at the time, but the stepmother's actions posthumously show she might not have been worthy. The author could argue that honoring the dad's last wish is important, but the stepmother's actions could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nThe author is also protecting their mom and brother from harm. Not giving the necklace could be a way to resist the stepmother's control and abuse. The pressure from the stepmother is intense, but the author is standing their ground. \n\nFriends might say give it to avoid conflict, but the author's stance is about justice and protecting their family from someone who caused them pain. The necklace is a symbol of the dad's final wish, but the stepmother's actions might make the author feel that fulfilling it would enable her further abuse. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to refuse, especially given the stepmother's malicious behavior. The dad's request was made under the influence of impending death and potential manipulation. The author is prioritizing their family's well-being over a material item, which is a strong ethical stance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
