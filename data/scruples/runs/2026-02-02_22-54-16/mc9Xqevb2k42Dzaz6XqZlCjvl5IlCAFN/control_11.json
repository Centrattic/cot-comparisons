My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's dad cheated on his wife (the author's mom) with another woman. The dad and mom split up, and he started living with the other woman. The author mentions that this woman tried to cut them out of his life, but the dad didn't let her. Then the dad got pancreatic cancer, married the woman, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give to her after he died. He also asked them to be nice to her and stay in touch. The author agreed for his sake.\n\nWhen the dad was in hospice, the stepmom didn't inform the family, prevented the author's mom from seeing him, and then during his last moments, she shoved the author's mom and made the family leave. After the dad died, the stepmom made the funeral about herself, excluded the family, and spread nasty things about the mom. The author is now refusing to give her the necklace, and she's pressuring them to get it.\n\nThe author's friends say to give it and move on, but the author is refusing because of the stepmom's behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving her the necklace.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dad's last wish versus the stepmom's actions. The dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given to her, but the stepmom's behavior was abusive and hurtful. The author feels they don't owe her anything after that.\n\nThe legal angle: If the dad legally gave the necklace to the stepmom, then maybe the author is supposed to give it. But if it was part of his estate, it might depend on his will. However, the author states that the dad gave it to him with the intention of giving it to the stepmom after his death. So, perhaps a legal obligation exists, but the ethical angle is different. The stepmom acted maliciously, so the author might feel justified in not fulfilling the request to protect their mom and themselves.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the author is hurt by the stepmom's actions. The stepmom took advantage of the dad's terminal illness, controlled the last moments, and was disrespectful. The author might see the necklace as a symbol of the dad's poor judgment in trusting her. Refusing to give it could be a way of standing up for their mom and not rewarding the stepmom's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initially agreed to fulfill the dad's request for his sake. Now, not giving the necklace might be seen as going back on that promise. But given the circumstances, the author could argue that the dad was manipulated or that the stepmom didn't deserve it after her actions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. Legally, if the dad made a clear request, there might be an expectation to comply. However, ethically, the author has valid reasons to refuse, especially considering the stepmom's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their family's well-being and refusing to enable the stepmom's actions. The friends' advice to give it up might be practical, but the author's decision is understandable given the context.\n"
