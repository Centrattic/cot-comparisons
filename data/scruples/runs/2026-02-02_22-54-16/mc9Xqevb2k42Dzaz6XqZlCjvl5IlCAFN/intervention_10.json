My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is at fault for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad passed away.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's dad cheated on their mom, started living with this other woman (the stepmom) who tried to cut them out. The dad married her after being diagnosed with cancer, gave the author the necklace to give her posthumously. The stepmom was hostile during the dad's final days, physically aggressive towards the author's mom, and excluded them from the funeral. Now, the stepmom is pressuring the author to give her the necklace, which the author refuses to do.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the stepmom didn't deserve it after her actions. Their friends suggest giving it to her to cut ties, but the author is holding firm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace.\n\nSo, what factors are important here? The dad's last wish vs. the stepmom's behavior. The author's responsibility to follow through on the request. But also, the stepmom's mistreatment of the family during the dad's illness.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, if the dad made a verbal request, unless there's a will or legal document specifying the necklace goes to the stepmom, the author isn't legally obligated to give it. However, there's the moral aspect. The dad wanted to give it, but the stepmom's actions were harmful.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to give the necklace. The stepmom's actions (physical aggression, excluding family from the funeral) might make the author feel that giving the necklace to her is rewarding bad behavior. Also, the stepmom's current harassment adds to the author's justification for not complying.\n\nBut ethically, when someone makes a final request, even if you disagree, there's a moral weight. However, if that request is being used manipulatively by someone who wronged the family, it's complicated. The author's stance is that the stepmom was using the dad and doesn't deserve the gift. The dad's request is part of his final wishes, but the stepmom's actions might have broken the trust the author had in her.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate between honoring a deceased's wishes versus protecting oneself from exploitation. The stepmom's behavior indicates she might not be trustworthy, so giving her the necklace could enable further harassment or exploitation. The author's friends suggest giving it to cut ties, which is a practical approach to avoid ongoing conflict.\n\nBut the author's friends are also divided. The key here is whether the author is obligated to fulfill the dad's request despite the stepmom's actions. If the dad's will had specified the necklace to the stepmom, it would be a stronger obligation. Since it's just a verbal request, the author has more leeway.\n\nAlso, considering the stepmom's actions during the dad's illness, the author might feel that honoring the request would be a betrayal to their mother and themselves. The necklace could symbolize the stepmom's manipulative behavior and the dad's possible guilt or confusion during his illness.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a moral argument to honor the dad's last wish, the stepmom's behavior and the author's need to protect themselves and their mother from further harm tip the balance. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing their family's well-being over a verbal request that might have been influenced by the stepmom's manipulative actions.\n"
