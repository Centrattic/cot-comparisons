My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a necklace that the author's dad wanted to give to his new wife after his death. The dad had a history of cheating on the author's mom with this woman, and after the split, he started living with her. The woman tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. Then the dad got cancer, married her, and before dying, gave the author an expensive necklace to give to her. However, the stepmom turned out to be really cruel, blocking the family from the hospice visit, being rude at the funeral, and now is pressuring the author to give her the necklace.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the dad explicitly gave the necklace to the wife, then legally the author might be in the wrong for not giving it. But if he gave it to the author with the request to give to the wife, but the author can contest that it was a conditional gift based on the wife's behavior, that's different. But without legal documents, it's tricky. However, the author's friends are telling them to just give it and forget, implying maybe there's no legal issue. But the author is refusing because of the wife's actions.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The dad's last wish is a big part here. The author is conflicted between honoring the dad's wishes and not giving in to what they see as the wife's manipulation. The wife's behavior\u2014shoving the mom, cutting the family out of the funeral, etc.\u2014makes the author reluctant. The author feels that the wife didn't deserve the necklace after her actions.\n\nThe key points are: was the necklace a gift from the dad to the wife, and was the author's refusal justified given the circumstances? If the dad intended it as a gift to the wife, then the author might be in the wrong for not fulfilling that request. However, if the author believes that the dad was being manipulated or that the wife's actions make her undeserving, there's a moral argument for not giving it. But legally, the author could be in a tight spot if the dad had the authority to give away the necklace (assuming it was his property). If the necklace was part of the dad's estate, then the author might have a responsibility to distribute it as per the dad's wishes unless there were conditions.\n\nBut the author is also dealing with emotional trauma and betrayal. The stepmom's actions were harmful, and the author is protecting their family. So maybe there's a moral high ground here. However, the dad's last request complicates things. Is honoring a deceased parent's wish more important than the family's feelings? It depends on the situation. The author is in a bind between two conflicting obligations.\n\nIn terms of the options, answer A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. Given that the dad was clear in his request and the author is refusing, unless there's a legal or moral reason to override the dad's wish, the author might be in the wrong. But considering the stepmom's behavior and the dad's possible manipulation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, legally and morally in terms of fulfilling a loved one's final request, the author is on the fence. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the stepmom's actions were bad, but the author's refusal might be justified as self-defense against her, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
