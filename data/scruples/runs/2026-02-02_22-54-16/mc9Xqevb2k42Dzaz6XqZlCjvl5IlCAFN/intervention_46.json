My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving their stepmom an expensive necklace their dad wanted them to give after he died. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated and married this woman after splitting from his wife. The stepmom tried to cut out the family but the dad kept in touch. Then he got cancer, married her, and asked the person to give her the necklace after he died. But the stepmom did some really bad things: shoved the mom, kept them from the hospice visit, controlled the funeral, and now is harassing them for the necklace.\n\nThe person feels they don't owe her the necklace after all that. Friends say to give it and move on, but they don't want to. The key points here are the dad's request versus the stepmom's actions. The person is caught between honoring their dad's last wish and protecting themselves from someone who was abusive. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the stepmom's behavior was really hurtful and manipulative. She took advantage of the dad's illness and tried to alienate the family. The person has a right to protect their own well-being and their mom's. The dad's request was made under the context of his illness and possible manipulation by her. The necklace was given by the dad as a gift, but the stepmom's actions make it hard for the person to comply. \n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, the person might have an obligation to give it. But since they're not in a position to enforce that, and the stepmom's actions were so egregious, the moral obligation is questionable. The person's decision to not give it is more about standing up for themselves and their family against someone who was harmful. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the stepmom's actions were abusive, and the person is justified in not giving the necklace to protect themselves.\n"
