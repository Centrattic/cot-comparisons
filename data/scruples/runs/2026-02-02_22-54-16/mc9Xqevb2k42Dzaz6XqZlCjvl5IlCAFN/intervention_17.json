My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this other woman. After the divorce, he started living with her, and she tried to cut the kids out. But the dad stayed in their lives. Then he got cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to the author to give her after his death. The author agreed for his sake. \n\nWhen the dad was in hospice, the stepmom lied about letting the kids and the mom visit. She even shoved the mom. The kids went to see their dad but were kicked out quickly. The funeral was a mess, and the stepmom was rude. The author told her off and didn't attend the funeral. Now, the stepmom is hounding the author for the necklace, which the author is refusing to give.\n\nThe author feels she doesn't owe her anything and is standing by that. Friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they won't. The question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nI think the key points here are the stepmom's actions. She was abusive, lied, and was disrespectful. The dad's wish was to give the necklace, but the stepmom's behavior shows she might not deserve it. The author is protecting their mom and honoring their dad's memory by not giving the necklace to someone who was harmful. \n\nThe author's friends are suggesting to give it, but the author is standing their ground. The dad's wish was to give it, but if he knew how she acted, he might have changed his mind. The necklace is a financial burden, and the author is prioritizing their family's well-being over fulfilling a request that now seems misguided.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're not obligated to honor a request that could enable someone who was abusive. The stepmom's actions were inconsiderate and harmful, so refusing is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
