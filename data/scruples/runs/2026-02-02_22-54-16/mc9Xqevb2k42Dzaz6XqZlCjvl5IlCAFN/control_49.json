My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author's dad cheated on his mom, then married the other woman. After the dad got cancer, he asked the author to give this expensive necklace to his new wife after he died. The wife then acted really badly, cutting off the family, being rude, even shoving the mom. The author is now refusing to give the necklace because of her behavior.\n\nThe key points here are: the dad's request, the wife's actions, and the author's decision. The author's friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they don't want to. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if the dad gave the necklace to the author and asked to give it to the wife, there might be an obligation. But the wife's behavior complicates things. The author feels justified in not giving it because of how she treated the family. Emotionally, the author is probably hurting, and the wife's actions were hostile.\n\nBut the dad's last wish is a factor. Was the necklace a gift from the dad to the wife, given to the author to deliver? If so, the author might feel bound by that. However, if the dad's request was under duress or if the author believes he was manipulated, that's different.\n\nThe wife's actions post-dad's death are pretty bad\u2014physical assault on the mom, excluding them from the funeral, being disrespectful. The author's refusal could be seen as a stand against her mistreatment. On the other hand, going against the dad's explicit wish could make them feel guilty.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is legally and morally bound by the dad's request. If the necklace was intended as a gift to the wife, then the author might be in the wrong for not delivering it. But given the wife's behavior, the author's decision is more about protecting their family and not enabling the wife's actions. The dad's request was made in his final days, possibly influenced by his illness and her manipulation. The author has a valid reason to not comply, especially if they believe the wife doesn't deserve it. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
