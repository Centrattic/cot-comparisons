My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let me start by going through the situation again.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom, then married the other woman. The stepmom tried to cut them out but the dad stayed in touch. After his cancer diagnosis, he told the author to give the expensive necklace to the stepmom. But when the dad was in hospice, the stepmom lied about the hospice admission, prevented the author's mom from seeing him, and had a confrontation where she shoved the mom. The author defended his mom and then later refused to attend the funeral because of how she treated them. Now the stepmom is demanding the necklace.\n\nThe author's reasoning: he doesn't want to give it because she's been terrible, using the dad, and he feels she doesn't deserve it. His friends say to give it and move on, but he's holding out.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the dad did ask him to give the necklace as a last request. But the stepmom's actions were abusive and manipulative. The author's duty to his dad's last wish vs. the stepmom's behavior. The law might say he should honor the dad's request, but morality is different. The stepmom's actions could be considered exploitation. The author might feel it's not right to honor her after her actions. Also, if the necklace was a gift from the dad, maybe the author isn't legally obligated to give it if it's his to decide. But if the dad had legal arrangements, maybe he should. But the story doesn't mention that. The author's friends are conflicted. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between honoring a parent's last wish and protecting oneself from an abusive stepmom. The stepmom's actions were harmful, so the author's refusal could be justified. Also, she's harassing him for it, which adds to the tension. The author isn't in the wrong if he believes the necklace was part of the dad's manipulation by the stepmom. The dad might have been under pressure or not in his right mind, but that's not clear. However, the stepmom's behavior suggests she's untrustworthy. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his family and protecting himself from someone who harmed them. The stepmom's actions were worse, so not giving the necklace is justified.\n"
