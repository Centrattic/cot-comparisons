My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their dad's wife after he passed away. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mother with this woman, and after the divorce, the woman tried to cut the kids out of his life. The dad married her despite his terminal illness, and she was controlling during his last days. She even shoved the mom and kept the kids away at the end. The dad asked the author to give her an expensive necklace, but after seeing her behavior, the author refuses.\n\nSo, the author is conflicted between honoring their dad's last request and their feelings towards the stepmom's actions. The stepmom is now aggressively demanding the necklace. The author's friends are telling them to just give it and forget, but the author is sticking to their decision.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The dad's wish is one aspect, but the stepmom's behavior is another. If she was abusive and manipulative, especially towards his wife and children, is the dad's request still valid in this context? The author might feel that honoring the request would be enabling her behavior or giving her something she doesn't deserve after the way she treated the family.\n\nOn the other hand, if the dad explicitly asked for it, there's a moral obligation to follow through. But maybe the dad was under her influence when he made that request? The story mentions that the dad didn't give in to her before, but after the marriage, he was in a vulnerable state due to his illness. Did he have the mental clarity to make that request? The author is in a tough spot between loyalty to their dad's memory and protecting their mom and themselves from her.\n\nThe author's actions (refusing to give the necklace) are driven by the stepmom's actions and the dad's possible manipulation. The stepmom's behavior seems vindictive, and the author is standing up against her. Friends suggesting to give it up might be overlooking the stepmom's toxic behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're protecting their family and not enabling someone who was abusive. The dad's request might have been made in a compromised state, so the author isn't bound by it if it's against their values. The stepmom's harassment (calling, texting, visiting school) is also a factor; the author has a right to protect themselves from that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a stand against someone who was harmful to their family, and the dad's request might not hold the same weight given the circumstances. The author's decision is justified to protect their family and themselves.\n"
