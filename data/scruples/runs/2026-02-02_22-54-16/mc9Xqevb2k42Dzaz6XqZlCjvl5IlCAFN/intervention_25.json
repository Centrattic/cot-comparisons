My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmom after their dad passed away. The options are A or B, with B meaning they aren't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom, the stepmom tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. After his cancer diagnosis, he married the stepmom and gave his kids a necklace to give her. But when the dad was dying, the stepmom kept the family away, even physically attacked the mom, and controlled the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace.\n\nThe author is refusing to give it because of how the stepmom acted. Their friends say to give it and move on, but the author feels justified in not giving it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details: The dad's request was for the kids to give the necklace to the stepmom. But the stepmom's actions were hostile and abusive. The necklace was a gift from the dad, but the stepmom's behavior might have nullified any obligation. The author's reasoning is that the stepmom was using the dad and didn't deserve the gift after her actions. The dad's dying wish, but the stepmom's actions could be seen as making her ungrateful or unkind.\n\nI think the author is in the right because the stepmom's behavior was harmful, and the dad's request might not be binding if fulfilling it would enable her abusive behavior. Also, the dad's health was deteriorating, so his judgment might have been compromised. The author is protecting their mother and themselves from someone who was clearly toxic. So the answer is B.\n"
