My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom, married the stepmom, and then gave her this expensive necklace through the author. The stepmom, however, tried to cut the kids and mom out, even physically attacked the mom. The author is holding onto the necklace and refuses to give it to her now. \n\nThe key points here: The dad's request was for the necklace to be given after his death, but the stepmom's actions were harmful. The author feels justified in not giving it because of how the stepmom treated everyone. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given, there might be an obligation. But if the author didn't promise in writing, maybe not. Morally, the stepmom's behavior was terrible. The author might feel the dad was manipulated into giving the necklace, so honoring that wish could be conflicting. \n\nThe author's friends say to give it and move on, but the author is standing their ground. The stepmom is harassing them for it. \n\nIn many cases, honoring a deceased's wishes is important, but when fulfilling that wish causes harm or supports a harmful person, there's room for moral judgment. The stepmom's actions were abusive, so giving her the necklace might enable her further. \n\nTherefore, the author's refusal could be seen as protecting their family's well-being. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
