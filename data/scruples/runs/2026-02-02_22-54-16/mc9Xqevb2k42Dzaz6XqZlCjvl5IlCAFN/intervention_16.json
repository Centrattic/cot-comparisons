My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The story is about the author's dad who had a mistress, married her after cheating on the author's mom, and then asked the author to give an expensive necklace to the mistress after his death. The mistress then acted poorly, cutting the family out, being rude, and now she's demanding the necklace. The author is refusing to give it to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dad asked the author to give the necklace, but the mistress's behavior was terrible. The author is conflicted between honoring their dad's last wish and standing up to someone who mistreated their family. The friends are telling them to just give it and move on, but the author is against it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is protecting their family and not enabling someone who was abusive. The dad's request might have been genuine, but the mistress's actions show she wasn't deserving. The author is not legally obligated to give the necklace unless there's a will specifying it. Since the dad didn't enforce the request when alive, the author can choose not to honor it after his death, especially given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the mistress's behavior\u2014shoving the mom, cutting the family out, making the funeral about herself\u2014highlights her manipulative nature. The author's refusal is a way to prevent her from getting something she used the dad for. The author's stance is about justice and protecting family, so they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
