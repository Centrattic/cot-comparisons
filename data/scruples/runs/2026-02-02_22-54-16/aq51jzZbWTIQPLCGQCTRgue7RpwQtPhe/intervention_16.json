I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The situation involves a trip to Germany where Caroline, the college friend, brings the author to meet her friend Jack. Then Caroline starts heavily flirting with Paul, Jack's friend, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author and Jack grow close and end up sleeping together. Caroline gets angry, says the author is an asshole, and has been demanding an apology for over a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author met Jack through Caroline, who had a history with him from high school. Caroline's actions during the trip seem to have been inconsistent. She planned to reconnect with Paul, which led to her hooking up with him, and then the author ended up with Jack. Caroline later claims she had a crush on Jack and was trying to make him jealous by getting with Paul. But the author didn't know this at the time and just thought Caroline was into Paul. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have any prior knowledge that Caroline liked Jack? The author didn't know, so they can't be blamed for not realizing it. Caroline's actions were deceptive if she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author and Jack were both on the trip as part of a group; the author wasn't intentionally trying to interfere with Caroline's potential feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, which happened after Caroline had already chosen to be with Paul. The author might have felt alone, but that's not an excuse. However, since Caroline was the one who brought both Paul and Jack into the mix, maybe the author wasn't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions. But Caroline didn't communicate her feelings at all during the trip, so the author had no reason to suspect. The author's relationship with Caroline might still be strained because of Caroline's reaction, but the author's actions were in the dark. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably isn't in the wrong. Caroline's behavior was manipulative, and the author had no way of knowing. The answer should be B.\n"
