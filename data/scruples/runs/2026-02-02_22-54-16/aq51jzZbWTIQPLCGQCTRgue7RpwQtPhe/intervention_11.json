I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author to Germany. Then, during the trip, Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and they got close. Eventually, the author and Jack hooked up when Paul and Caroline were out. The next day, Caroline flipped out, saying she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. She's been upset and demanding an apology.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author know about Caroline's feelings for Jack? The author says they didn't know. Caroline planned the trip to reconnect with Jack, but didn't mention her crush. The author thought Caroline was into Paul. The author and Jack ended up together when Caroline was with Paul.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they didn't know about the crush. They were just following the situations as they happened. Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul, ignoring the author) might have given the impression that she was into Paul. The author didn't have any indication of her feelings for Jack until after the fact.\n\nBut Caroline's argument is that she planned the trip to see if Jack still felt something and used Paul to make him jealous. However, she didn't communicate this to the author. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's intentions. So the author wasn't intentionally trying to take Jack from Caroline. They formed a connection with Jack during the trip, which happened after Caroline had already hooked up with Paul.\n\nIs there a betrayal here? The author and Caroline were friends, but Caroline's actions during the trip might have contributed to the situation. The author wasn't in on Caroline's plan. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by not knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. Since the author couldn't have known, it's hard to blame them. The responsibility might lie with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
