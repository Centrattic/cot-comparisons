I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend, Jack, and they met Paul, who Caroline immediately started flirting with and ended up hooking up with. Meanwhile, the author and Jack got closer over the 10 days, and they ended up hooking up. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have known she liked Jack instead of Paul. The author refuses to apologize, and now Caroline is still upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline's actions with Paul vs. the author's actions with Jack. Caroline used Paul to make Jack jealous, which is a bit manipulative. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and thought they were just meeting Paul. The author and Jack formed a connection naturally during the trip. \n\nCaroline's main argument is that the author should have realized she liked Jack and not Paul. But how could the author know that? Caroline was the one who was actively ignoring the author and others to be with Paul. The author wasn't aware of her true intentions. Also, Caroline planned the trip with the intent to reconnect with Jack, which is a bit sneaky. The author ended up with Jack because they developed a relationship during the trip, not because they knew about Caroline's crush beforehand.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't do anything to intentionally sabotage Caroline's plans. If Caroline wanted to pursue Jack, she should have been honest from the start. The author had no way of knowing, and it's not their responsibility to read Caroline's mind. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Caroline's actions are more questionable because she used Paul and kept her true intentions hidden.\n"
