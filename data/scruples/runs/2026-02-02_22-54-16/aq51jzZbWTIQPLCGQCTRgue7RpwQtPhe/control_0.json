I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's high school crush. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school study abroad program. She also met Paul and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. Caroline got really upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings. She accuses the author of ruining the trip by sleeping with Jack instead of Paul.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Caroline was the one who brought the author to meet Jack and Paul. She was the one actively flirting with Paul and ignoring others. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. \n\nCaroline's actions could be seen as manipulative. She was using Paul to get close to Jack, which might be a bit underhanded. The author was just there as a friend, and it seems like Caroline didn't communicate her feelings about Jack beforehand. The author wasn't aware that Jack was off-limits or that Caroline had those intentions. \n\nAlso, the author didn't set out to ruin anything. They were just following what Caroline arranged. The fact that Caroline planned the trip with the hope of reconnecting with Jack isn't something the author could have known. The author's actions were based on the information available at the time, which didn't include Caroline's crush.\n\nCaroline's reaction seems disproportionate. She took the trip with the author, who she considered a good friend, and didn't disclose her feelings. The author isn't responsible for reading her mind or knowing her secret agenda. The author's refusal to apologize seems justified because they didn't do anything wrong from their perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies more with Caroline for not being honest and for using manipulative tactics. The author had no way of knowing the true purpose of the trip and acted within their right to pursue a connection with Jack when it seemed like a possibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
