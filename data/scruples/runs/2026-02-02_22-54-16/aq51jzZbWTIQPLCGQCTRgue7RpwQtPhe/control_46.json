I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's high school crush. First, let's outline the key points.\n\nThe author went on a trip with their college friend, Caroline. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's. They ended up hooking up. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. Caroline then got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack and that the trip was planned to see if he still liked her. She accused the author of ruining the trip and being a \"slutty bitch,\" demanding an apology. The author refuses, feeling they had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider the dynamics. The author was an invited guest on Caroline's trip. Caroline's actions with Paul and her true intentions with the trip were not communicated to the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack; that was revealed after the fact. The author and Jack developed a connection during the trip, which led to the sleeping together. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't have prior knowledge that Caroline had romantic feelings for Jack. The author's actions were based on the available information at the time. Caroline's manipulation (using Paul to make Jack jealous) adds a layer of complexity. The author was not in a relationship with Caroline and wasn't aware of her plans. Relationships are often complicated, but in this case, the author acted without malicious intent and couldn't reasonably have known Caroline's true motives. \n\nCaroline's reaction seems extreme and possibly vindictive, especially since she didn't communicate her intentions. The author's refusal to apologize makes sense because they weren't in the wrong. The main issue lies with Caroline's lack of transparency and her using the trip for personal gain without disclosing her feelings to the author or Jack. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
