I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, Caroline invited the author, let's call them the narrator, to Germany. While there, Caroline started dating Paul, but the narrator ended up hooking up with Jack, who was Paul's friend. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the trip was a chance to see if he still liked her. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The narrator didn't know about Caroline's crush and ended up with Jack. Now Caroline is angry and wants an apology.\n\nFirst, the narrator didn't know about Caroline's history with Jack. Caroline was the one who introduced the narrator to Paul and Jack. She was the one actively pursuing Paul, which the narrator didn't interfere with. The narrator and Jack developed a connection while Caroline was busy with Paul. The narrator didn't have any indication that Jack was off-limits because Caroline didn't mention it. \n\nCaroline's actions seem a bit manipulative. She planned the trip with the intent to check on Jack, used Paul as a way to get to Jack, and didn't communicate her feelings to the narrator. The narrator was just following the social interactions as they happened. Since the narrator had no knowledge of Caroline's feelings for Jack, they can't be blamed for the situation. \n\nCaroline might be in the wrong for not being honest about her intentions and for setting up the situation where the conflict could happen. The narrator acted based on the information they had at the time, which didn't include Caroline's crush on Jack. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
