I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, and they end up hooking up. Meanwhile, the author ends up spending time with Jack, Caroline's high school friend, and ends up sleeping with Jack. Caroline then gets really upset, claims she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings for her, and is angry at the author for sleeping with him. She's been demanding an apology for over a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and her plan to use Paul as a way to get Jack's attention. The author's actions were based on the assumption that Caroline was interested in Paul, which led to the author being close to Jack and eventually sleeping with him. \n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author acted in a way that crossed a line or breached trust. The author was a friend of Caroline's and was invited on the trip. Caroline's intentions were not communicated to the author at the time. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline's interest in Paul was a ruse to get Jack's attention. The author's relationship with Jack developed naturally during the trip, and there's no indication that the author was aware of Caroline's true feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, Caroline might feel that using Paul as a means to an end was a strategic move, and the author's actions interfered with her plan. However, the author wasn't aware of that plan. The author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. \n\nAnother angle is the idea of trust and friendship. Caroline's plan might be seen as manipulative, but the author isn't responsible for reading her mind or figuring out her hidden agenda. The author's actions weren't malicious, and they weren't in a position to know Caroline's intentions. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information available and had no way of knowing about Caroline's true feelings. The responsibility for not communicating her intentions lies with Caroline, not the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
