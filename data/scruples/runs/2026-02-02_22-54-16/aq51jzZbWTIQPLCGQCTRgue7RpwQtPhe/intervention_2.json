I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. They met Jack and Caroline's friend Paul. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul and ended up hooking up with him, leaving the author to hang out with Jack. Over the 10 days, Caroline kept making plans to see Paul, and the author formed a close bond with Jack. They ended up sleeping together. When the author told Caroline, she went ballistic, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and that she planned the trip to test if Jack still liked her. She accused the author of ruining things and being a slut. The author refuses to apologize, and now they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are about intent and boundaries. Caroline orchestrated the trip to see her high school crush. She was the one who connected with Paul and was ignoring others, including the author. The author, in turn, formed a connection with Jack, who was a friend of Paul's. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack beforehand, so there's no indication they conspired to take Jack from her. The key issue is whether the author had a responsibility to know Caroline's intentions. Since Caroline was the one who was actively pursuing Paul and didn't communicate her feelings about Jack to the author, the author's actions seem justified. The problem here is on Caroline's side for not being transparent and using the trip to test her crush. The author's actions, while perhaps a bit naive, were based on their own experiences and interactions without prior knowledge. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
