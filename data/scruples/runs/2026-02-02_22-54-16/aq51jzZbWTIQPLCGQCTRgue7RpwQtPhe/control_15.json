I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school study abroad program, and introduced the author to Jack's friend Paul. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ignoring the author, and ended up hooking up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually sleeping with him. When Caroline found out, she got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack all along and was trying to make him jealous by being with Paul. Now, she's upset and wants an apology.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let me think about the key points.\n\nCaroline's actions: She went to Germany, reconnected with Jack, and planned this trip partly to check if Jack still liked her. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know any of this and ended up with Jack. \n\nThe author's perspective: They thought Caroline was genuinely interested in Paul, hence why they spent time with Jack. They didn't know about Caroline's crush or her plan. The author feels they had no way of knowing, so they're not at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions. They were just following the situation as it unfolded. Caroline's actions might be more questionable because she was using Paul to manipulate Jack's emotions. The author had no malicious intent and thought they were just being friendly and reciprocating Jack's interest.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of friendship. The author is a friend of Caroline's, and sleeping with someone who's a crush of your friend could be seen as crossing a line, even if unintentionally. But in this case, the author had no knowledge of Caroline's feelings towards Jack, so it's not like they conspired or took advantage. It's more of a misunderstanding based on Caroline's secrecy.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had a reasonable way of knowing Caroline's feelings. Since they didn't, and the author acted on their own connection with Jack, the blame would more likely be on Caroline for not being transparent and using Paul to manipulate the situation. The author isn't in the wrong here because they couldn't have known. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
