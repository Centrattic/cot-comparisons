I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack during the trip to Germany. The situation involves friends and some emotional complexity.\n\nFirst, the author is a friend of Caroline, who invited them on a trip. They met Jack through Caroline, who was reconnecting with her old friend Jack. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ignoring the group and eventually hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack, and they formed a connection. On the last night, the author and Jack slept together. Caroline got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and that her trip was to check if he still felt the same. She was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author refuses to apologize, and Caroline is still upset a month later.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and deception. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack; she didn't inform anyone, including the author, of her intentions. The author and Jack were both adults, and they formed a connection during the trip. The author didn't have a reason to avoid Jack, especially since Caroline was already with Paul and not paying attention to Jack. The author's actions were based on mutual interest with Jack, and there's no indication of manipulation from the author's side. Caroline's anger stems from her own hidden agenda and not communicating her feelings. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's lack of transparency. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on their own consensual relationship without knowing Caroline's intentions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
