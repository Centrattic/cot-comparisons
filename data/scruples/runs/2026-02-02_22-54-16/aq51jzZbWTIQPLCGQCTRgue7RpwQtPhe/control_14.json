I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline, a close friend. Caroline was in Germany for a summer program in high school and reconnected with Jack there. They met Jack and his friends, and Caroline immediately started flirting with Paul, hooking up with him while the author was with Jack. Over the 10 days, Caroline kept pushing to see Paul, and the author ended up bonding with Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. The next day, Caroline was furious, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and had planned the trip to test if he still liked her, using Paul to make Jack jealous. Now, Caroline is upset and wants an apology, but the author refuses, thinking they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent, knowledge, and manipulation. Caroline's actions seem a bit manipulative. She used Paul to get back at Jack, which is underhanded. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's true intentions with Paul; they thought Caroline was genuinely into him. The author developed a relationship with Jack, who was available and willing. Caroline's anger stems from her own manipulative behavior and not communicating her intentions. The author didn't know about the crush or the plan, so they couldn't have acted with malice. It seems like Caroline put herself in a situation where she could be manipulated, and then blamed the author for acting on her own connection with Jack. The author isn't in the wrong here because they acted based on the information they had at the time. Caroline's actions were deceitful, and the author had no reason to know. So the answer is B.\n"
