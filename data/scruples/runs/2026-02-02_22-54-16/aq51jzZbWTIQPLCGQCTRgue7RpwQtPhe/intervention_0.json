I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was Caroline's high school crush. So, the situation is that Caroline brought the author on a trip to Germany, where she reconnected with Jack. Caroline then started flirting with Paul, but the author ended up getting close to Jack and they hooked up. Caroline got upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known to avoid him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school and went on the trip partly to see if he still felt the same. She dated Paul during the trip, possibly to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and formed a relationship with Jack. Caroline's reaction is anger and demands for an apology.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author wasn't aware of Caroline's feelings towards Jack. Caroline didn't communicate her intentions to the author, and the author had no way of knowing. The author and Jack developed a relationship while Caroline was with Paul, which might complicate things, but the author wasn't in a relationship with Caroline. \n\nCaroline's actions\u2014dating Paul to make Jack jealous and using the trip for her own romantic agenda\u2014might be seen as manipulative. The author acted on their own feelings without knowing Caroline's plan. It's important to note that the author didn't know about the crush and had no malicious intent. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries and communication are key. Since Caroline didn't clarify her feelings with the author, the author can't be held responsible for not knowing. The problem lies more with Caroline's lack of communication and her own manipulative behavior towards Jack. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
