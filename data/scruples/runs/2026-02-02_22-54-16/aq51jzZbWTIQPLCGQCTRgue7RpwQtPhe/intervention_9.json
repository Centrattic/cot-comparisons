I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Caroline, who invited the author to Germany, where they met Jack and Paul. Caroline hooked up with Paul to make Jack jealous, and the author ended up with Jack. Now Caroline is upset and demanding an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. She was just going along with the trip and ended up connecting with Jack. Caroline's actions seem a bit manipulative\u2014using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. Also, the author didn't do anything to actively sabotage Caroline's plans; it was more about Caroline's own actions and decisions.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual attraction. If the author and Jack both felt a connection and it was consensual, then the author isn't at fault. The problem here is Caroline's expectations. She used the trip to pursue her high school crush, but the author wasn't aware of that. The author's actions were based on the situation as it presented itself during the trip, without prior knowledge of Caroline's plan.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a friend, the author should have been more attuned to Caroline's feelings. But the author claims she didn't know about the crush and that Caroline was the one actively flirting with Paul. It also seems like Caroline kept her intentions secret, which complicates things. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden agenda.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't have the necessary information to avoid the situation. Caroline's manipulation and hidden motives play a big role here. The author acted based on the circumstances as they were presented to her. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
