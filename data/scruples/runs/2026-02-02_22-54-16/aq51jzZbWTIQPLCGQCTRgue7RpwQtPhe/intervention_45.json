I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack (the high school crush). The author ended up getting close to Jack and they had a relationship. Caroline got upset, thinking she had a plan to get Jack back and that the author ruined her chances by sleeping with Jack.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Caroline had a crush on Jack from five years ago and went on the trip hoping to reconnect. But instead of pursuing Jack, she ended up with Paul. The author, who was there with Caroline, ended up with Jack. So the question is, was the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the author didn't know about Caroline's plan. Caroline didn't disclose that she was trying to reconnect with Jack. She was actively involved with Paul, and the author was left with Jack. The author didn't know that Caroline's actions were part of a strategy to get Jack back. So in that case, the author had no way of knowing that Jack was her target. \n\nThen, the author and Jack formed a bond during the trip. There's no indication that the author was aware of Caroline's intentions. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, not any manipulation. Caroline is upset that the author didn't figure out her hidden agenda and that her plan backfired. But the author didn't do anything to interfere with Caroline's initial interactions with Paul. \n\nAlso, Caroline's plan involved using Paul to make Jack jealous. If she was using Paul as a means to an end, maybe that's where she went wrong. The author, on the other hand, just acted on the connection they formed with Jack, which is a natural outcome of spending time together. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they had no knowledge of Caroline's intentions. It's Caroline who set up the trip with her own agenda and then got upset when things didn't go her way. The author is not responsible for Caroline's plan, especially since she didn't communicate it. The author's actions were based on their own experiences and the relationship they built with Jack during the trip. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issue here is that Caroline didn't communicate her intentions, and the author had no way of knowing about her plan to reconnect with Jack. The author is justified in their actions because they were based on their own interactions, not any deceit towards them.\n"
