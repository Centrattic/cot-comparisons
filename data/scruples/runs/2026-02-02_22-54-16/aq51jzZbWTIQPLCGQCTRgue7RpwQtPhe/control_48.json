I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the person who asked (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had met Jack, a high school crush from five years ago, and started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's. Then she hooked up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they had a relationship. Caroline got upset because she had a crush on Jack back then and thought the author should have known he was her target, so she's angry at the author for taking Jack. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had any reason to know that Caroline liked Jack. The author points out that Caroline was with Paul the whole time, so it's unclear how the author could have known. Caroline later admitted she was trying to get Jack's attention by being with Paul, but the author didn't have that information at the time. \n\nAlso, the author and Jack developed a connection during the trip. If Jack was single and not in a relationship, then the author's actions aren't inherently wrong. Caroline's issue seems to be with her own failed attempt to rekindle a past relationship and then projecting her intentions onto the author. The author didn't know Caroline's true feelings towards Jack, so they couldn't have intentionally interfered. \n\nCaroline's anger might stem from her own actions and miscommunication. She used Paul to try to get Jack's attention, and then blamed the author for the outcome. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's unexpressed feelings from the past. The key here is whether the author had any obligation to know or act on Caroline's hidden agenda, which seems unlikely. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
