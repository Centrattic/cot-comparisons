I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline, who met someone named Jack, a friend from her high school crush. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ends up getting close to Jack and they sleep together. Caroline gets really upset because she had a crush on Jack from years ago and thought the author should have known she was after Jack instead of Paul.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's intentions with Jack. Caroline was the one who initiated the trip and introduced the author to Jack. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack from high school. Caroline's actions with Paul were a red herring, but the author had no way of knowing that. The author and Jack developed a connection during the trip, leading to their relationship. \n\nNow, was the author at fault? Well, the author wasn't aware of Caroline's plan. They were just following along, and when given the opportunity to connect with Jack, they did so. It's not the author's responsibility to read Caroline's mind or know her hidden agenda. Caroline's own actions with Paul might have been confusing, but the author had no indication that Jack was her target. \n\nHowever, one could argue that the author should have been more cautious or maybe considered Caroline's feelings. But since Caroline didn't communicate her intentions, it's not fair to blame the author. The main issue here seems to be Caroline's manipulation and lack of transparency. She used Paul as a means to get to Jack and then blamed the author for her own actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. Caroline's anger stems from her own miscalculations and not clearly expressing her feelings. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
