I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush from five years ago. She also met Paul, and they ended up hooking up. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack and eventually they had a one-night stand. Caroline got really upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the trip was to see if he still felt the same. She accused the author of stealing Jack and being a slut, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just hanging out with Jack because Paul didn't have a car. The author and Jack became close and had sex. Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous, which the author had no way of knowing. The author didn't have any intention of messing with Caroline's plans because they were unaware of them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what's described, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions. They formed a connection with Jack on their own. There's no indication that the author was aware of Caroline's crush or her manipulative use of Paul. The author's actions were based on their own experiences and feelings during the trip. Since they had no way of knowing Caroline's plan, it's not their fault. Also, Caroline's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since the author wasn't aware of her intentions.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author cross any boundaries? The author was with Jack, and they both decided to have sex. There's no indication that Jack was in a relationship or that Caroline had any claim over him. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings, so they couldn't have acted on them. The problem here is more about Caroline's deception and poor communication. She used Paul to make Jack jealous, which is manipulative, and then blamed the author for her own actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for manipulating the situation. The author acted on their own connection with Jack without knowing about Caroline's hidden agenda. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
