I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline arranged to meet Jack, someone she knew from a summer program in Germany when she was 15. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ends up spending time with Jack and they develop a connection, eventually sleeping together. When the author tells Caroline about sleeping with Jack, Caroline gets really upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack back in high school and that she brought the author along to get Jack jealous. Now Caroline is upset and demands an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are: Caroline's actions versus the author's actions. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author spent time with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul, and when the opportunity arose, they had a relationship. \n\nCaroline's reasoning is that she orchestrated the trip to get back at Jack, using Paul to make him jealous. But the author had no way of knowing her motives. The author isn't in a relationship with Caroline, so sleeping with Jack isn't cheating. However, the author might have felt some obligation as a friend not to get involved with someone Caroline was connected to, but Caroline's own actions (sleeping with Paul while ignoring the author) might have contributed. \n\nIs the author at fault for not knowing Caroline's hidden agenda? Probably not, because the author had no way of being aware. Caroline's expectations were unreasonable, as she didn't communicate her feelings to the author beforehand. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not any prior knowledge. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies more with Caroline's manipulation and failure to communicate her intentions. The author had no obligation to protect Caroline's feelings about Jack, especially since Caroline was already engaged with Paul. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
