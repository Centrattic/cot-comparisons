I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend, Caroline. Caroline reconnected with her high school crush, Jack, and also met Paul. Caroline was really into Paul, ignoring everyone else, and ended up hooking up with him. The author ended up getting close to Jack, and after Caroline and Paul were out, the author and Jack had sex. The next day, Caroline flipped out because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known not to sleep with him, since she was trying to win Jack back by being with Paul to make him jealous. The author refuses to apologize and is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings. She then started flirting with Paul, not Jack, while on the trip. The author got close to Jack and ended up sleeping with him. Caroline's reaction is that the author is a bad person for this.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack because Caroline was actively pursuing Paul instead. The author formed a connection with Jack, who was a friend of Caroline's, and ended up having sex with him. Caroline is upset because she thought the author should have known not to do that, given her unspoken intentions.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. Caroline was the one who was flirting with Paul, making it clear she was interested in him. The author and Jack became close during the trip. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, not knowing Caroline's feelings. Caroline's plan seems a bit manipulative because she used Paul to get back at Jack, and then blames the author for following through with Jack once the opportunity arose.\n\nCaroline's behavior is questionable here. She intentionally set up the trip with the hope of rekindling a high school relationship, but instead of being honest about her feelings, she tried to use Paul as a means to an end. The author, acting on their own connections and without knowledge of Caroline's secret agenda, isn't necessarily at fault. The author also mentions that they were creeped out by Caroline's planning, which shows some awareness of her manipulative behavior.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't act with malice. They were just following their own feelings and the connection they formed with Jack. There's no indication that the author knew about Caroline's crush at the time. So, the author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not on any prior knowledge of Caroline's secret intentions.\n\nIn terms of friendship, Caroline's reaction is extreme. She's holding the author accountable for something they couldn't have known. The author isn't responsible for reading Caroline's mind or uncovering hidden motives that weren't communicated. Friendships require honesty and communication, and in this case, Caroline didn't disclose her feelings towards Jack, leading to the conflict.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Caroline's actions and expectations are more problematic here. The answer should be B.\n"
