I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author to Germany. They met Jack and his friends. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ignoring the author, and ended up hooking up with Paul the first night. Then, over the next days, Caroline kept seeking out Paul, who needed Jack for transportation. The author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. The next day, Caroline flipped out, saying she had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to see if Jack still liked her. She used Paul to make Jack jealous and was upset that the author took Jack.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline was the one who initiated the trip, possibly with the intention of reconnecting with Jack. She was the one who was actively pursuing Paul and ignoring the author. The author ended up with Jack when Caroline wasn't paying attention. But Caroline later claims she wanted Jack, making the author feel like she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the author's actions: They were invited by Caroline, didn't know about her crush on Jack, and ended up in a situation where they were spending time with Jack because Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't know Caroline's intentions and acted on their own feelings. Caroline's anger seems to stem from not getting Jack for herself, and she's now angry at the author for taking him.\n\nBut wait, Caroline was the one who initially started with Paul. Did she act in a way that led the author to believe Jack was available? The author might have thought Jack was available since Caroline was focusing on Paul. Also, Caroline didn't communicate her feelings about Jack to the author. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline was trying to get Jack back.\n\nHowever, the author did have a close relationship with Caroline. By sleeping with her crush, the author might have gone against Caroline's unspoken intentions. But since Caroline didn't clarify that Jack was her target, the author couldn't have known. The author's actions were based on the situation as it presented itself, not knowing Caroline's hidden agenda.\n\nCaroline's responsibility here is that she didn't communicate her feelings. She created a situation where she was pursuing Paul but also wanted Jack, perhaps using Paul as a distraction. The author was just following the dynamics presented to them. So the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the necessary information to know better. Caroline's manipulation or lack of transparency is the main issue here.\n"
