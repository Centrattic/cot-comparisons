I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author went on a trip to Germany with Caroline, who had studied there as a high school student. During the trip, Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school days, and the group of friends. On the first night, Caroline flirts heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author and Jack spend time together and develop a close relationship, eventually leading to the author sleeping with Jack.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault. Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack from five years ago and thought the trip was her chance to reconnect with him. She ended up with Paul, but she's now angry that the author was with Jack instead.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, were there any unspoken expectations or boundaries? The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack when they agreed to meet him. So, from the author's perspective, they were just being friendly and spending time with someone new. However, Caroline had her own agenda, which was to make Jack jealous by being with Paul. The author didn't know that either.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. The author and Jack were both free to choose who they wanted to be with, right? Caroline's actions with Paul were her choice, and if Jack was interested in the author, and vice versa, then their relationship was mutual. The problem is more about Caroline's unexpressed feelings and her manipulative behavior with Paul.\n\nBut wait, the author's college friend is Caroline, and she's angry that the author was with Jack, her high school crush. The author didn't know about this crush beforehand. Did Caroline ever mention that she had feelings for Jack during the trip? It seems like she only revealed her intentions after the fact. If the author had no prior knowledge, then they couldn't have intentionally acted to hurt Caroline. \n\nAlso, the author's actions weren't malicious. They were part of a group where everyone was interacting. The author and Jack naturally formed a connection. Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous might be the root of the problem here. The author might not have any responsibility for Caroline's past crush or her manipulative actions during the trip.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions. However, Caroline didn't communicate her feelings for Jack until after the fact. Without that information, the author couldn't have known. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they weren't given any signs to avoid Jack. \n\nCaroline's reaction seems over-the-top, especially since she was the one who set up the trip and chose to be with Paul. The author's refusal to apologize makes sense if they didn't do anything wrong. The key here is whether the author acted with intent to harm Caroline's feelings, which doesn't appear to be the case. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't know about Caroline's past feelings for Jack and their own actions were consensual and not based on any deceit. The fault might lie more with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions from the start.\n"
