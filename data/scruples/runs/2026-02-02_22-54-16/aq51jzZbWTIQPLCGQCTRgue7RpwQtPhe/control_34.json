I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the context: The author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend, Jack, from her high school program there. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack, and they eventually had a one-night stand. After the trip, Caroline was upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack from high school and had planned the trip to test if he still liked her. She's been angry with the author for sleeping with Jack.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider:\n\n1. Did the author know about Caroline's feelings for Jack beforehand? The author claims they didn't. Caroline only revealed her feelings and intentions after the fact. If the author had no prior knowledge, then they couldn't have intentionally interfered. \n\n2. Ethical boundaries: The author isn't in a relationship with Caroline, so they aren't cheating on her. However, they are friends with her, and Jack was someone Caroline had a crush on. But the author didn't know about the crush at the time, so they didn't act with malicious intent.\n\n3. Caroline's actions: Caroline herself was involved with Paul during the trip. She might have been using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author's actions were reciprocated by Jack, and Caroline's anger seems more about her own failed romantic strategy than the author's behavior.\n\n4. Friendship dynamics: The author was invited on the trip by Caroline. Caroline's plan to test Jack's feelings might be a personal issue, but the author isn't responsible for reading her mind. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, not Caroline's unspoken intentions.\n\n5. Consent and mutual attraction: The author and Jack were both adults, and they had a consensual encounter. The author isn't at fault for that in itself. The issue is more about Caroline's expectations and her reaction.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author didn't have the necessary information to know about Caroline's feelings. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, and they had no way of preventing the situation. Caroline's anger stems from her own uncommunicated plans and unrequited feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
