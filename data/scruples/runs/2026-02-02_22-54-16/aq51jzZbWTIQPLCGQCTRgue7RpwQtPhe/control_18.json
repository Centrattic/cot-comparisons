I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, and they ended up hooking up. Meanwhile, the author got close to Jack, Caroline's friend, and they ended up hooking up too. Caroline got really upset, saying she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings for her. She's angry at the author for sleeping with Jack.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was invited on the trip by Caroline. Caroline led the author to meet Jack and Paul. Caroline was the one flirting with Paul, and the author ended up with Jack. The key point here is whether the author had a reason to know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The story says that Caroline's crush was from 5 years ago, and she only told the author about it after the fact. The author claims they had no way of knowing Caroline liked Jack, which seems true because she didn't mention it before.\n\nCaroline's actions: She went to Germany, connected with Jack, then started flirting with Paul to make Jack jealous. The author, not knowing this, connected with Jack. Since Caroline didn't communicate her intentions beforehand, the author couldn't have known. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden agenda. Also, the author didn't know about the crush until after the fact, so they didn't intentionally interfere. \n\nBut maybe there's an issue with how things unfolded. The author was with Caroline's friend Jack, but Caroline didn't clarify her feelings about Jack before the trip. The author might have assumed Jack was single and available since Caroline introduced him as a friend. If Jack was single and not in a relationship, then the author isn't at fault for forming a connection with him. Caroline's jealousy comes from her own actions and unspoken intentions.\n\nAnother angle: Caroline used the trip to try to rekindle a past crush but didn't inform the author. The author had no knowledge of this, so the author isn't in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with Jack. The responsibility lies with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions. The author didn't know she was trying to get back with Jack, so they didn't have a way to avoid that situation. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything to intentionally sabotage Caroline's plans. The hook-up with Jack was a result of their own interactions, which were separate from Caroline's actions. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's emotional state because she didn't communicate her feelings beforehand. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
