I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The scenario is a bit complicated. \n\nFirst, Caroline invited the author to Germany. They met Jack and Paul. Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul, ignored the author and Jack. Then Caroline hooked up with Paul, and the author ended up getting close to Jack. Eventually, the author slept with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. Caroline then flipped out, saying she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her, using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author refuses to apologize, and Caroline is still upset.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline was the one who was with Paul, and the author formed a connection with Jack. Caroline's actions might have been manipulative, using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have paid attention to the signs? However, Caroline was actively avoiding the author and Jack, so maybe it's not the author's fault. Caroline's plan was underhanded. The author was just being genuine in their interactions. The key point is that Caroline's intentions were hidden. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's manipulative behavior. So, the answer would be no, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
