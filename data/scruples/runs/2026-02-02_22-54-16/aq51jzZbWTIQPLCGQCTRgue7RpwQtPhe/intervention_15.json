I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was their college friend Caroline's high school crush.\n\nFirst, the situation starts with Caroline inviting the author on a trip to Germany. There, Caroline reconnects with Jack, but she immediately starts flirting with Paul, Jack's friend. She ends up hooking up with Paul, and the author ends up getting closer to Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack sleep together while Caroline and Paul are out. The next day, Caroline is upset, claims she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous, and accuses the author of ruining the trip. The author refuses to apologize, leading to ongoing conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and the knowledge of Caroline's intentions. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack; she only found out after the fact. The author and Jack were both interested in each other and ended up sleeping together consensually. Caroline's actions included manipulating the situation by using Paul to get back at Jack, which might be more problematic. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions, so she can't be blamed for acting on her own connection with Jack. Caroline's demand for an apology seems to stem from her own manipulative behavior and unacknowledged feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
