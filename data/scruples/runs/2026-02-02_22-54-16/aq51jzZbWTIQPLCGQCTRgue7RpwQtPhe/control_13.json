I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline, who invited them to Germany. They met Jack, a friend of Caroline's from when she studied there. Caroline immediately started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author got closer to Jack, and they ended up sleeping together. When Caroline found out, she flipped out, claiming she had a crush on Jack and that the whole trip was to see if he still liked her, using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's now demanding an apology, but the author is unsure if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Caroline set up the trip and introduced the author to Jack. She was actively pursuing Paul, leaving the author and Jack to hang out. The author and Jack became close and had a relationship. Caroline claims she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to make him jealous. The question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack, given that Caroline had a crush on him and her intentions might have been misleading.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just hanging out with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. The author's actions seem legitimate because they didn't know Caroline was trying to get Jack's attention through Paul. Caroline's manipulation might be the root of the issue here. She brought the author to meet Jack, then used Paul as a distraction, and then got upset when the author was with Jack. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions with Paul. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's manipulative plan. Caroline's actions seem more problematic because she orchestrated the trip for her own purposes and then blamed the author. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
