I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The situation involves a trip to Germany where Caroline, the friend, reconnects with Paul and Jack. The author ends up hooking up with Jack, which leads to Caroline's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Caroline had a high school crush on Jack and planned the trip possibly to see if he still had feelings. However, she ends up with Paul, and the author ends up with Jack. The key points are: Caroline's intentions with the trip, the author's knowledge (or lack thereof) about Caroline's feelings for Jack, and whether the author acted in a way that violated trust or boundaries.\n\nCaroline is a close friend, and the author was invited on the trip. When Caroline starts pursuing Paul, the author ends up connecting with Jack. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. So, from the author's perspective, they were acting on their own feelings and the situation as it presented itself. \n\nHowever, Caroline's anger stems from feeling that the author didn't recognize her \"true\" intentions. The author might not have had a way to know that Caroline was using Paul to get Jack's attention. But is the author responsible for reading Caroline's mind? Or is Caroline overstepping by not being transparent about her plans?\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is in a relationship, it's a different scenario, but here Caroline was with Paul. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's ulterior motives. The author and Jack ended up together, and Caroline's claim is that the author should have known better. But without explicit communication from Caroline, the author couldn't have foreseen this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author acted in a way that was unethical given the circumstances. Since the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and was acting on their own agency, it's more likely that the fault lies with Caroline for not being clear about her intentions and possibly leading the author on. The author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't have known, and they acted on the information they had at the time.\n"
