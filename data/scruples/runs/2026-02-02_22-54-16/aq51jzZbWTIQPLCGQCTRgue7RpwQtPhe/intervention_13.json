I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a college friend, Caroline, who invited the author to Germany. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, while the author ended up getting close to Jack, Caroline's high school crush. The author ended up sleeping with Jack, and Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known that. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack from her high school trip. She invited the author to Germany, reconnected with Jack, and then started hooking up with Paul, possibly to make Jack jealous. The author and Jack grew closer and had a relationship, which led to Caroline's anger. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack. The author argues they had no way of knowing about Caroline's crush. Caroline, on the other hand, claims that the author should have recognized she was interested in Jack and not Paul.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had any indication that Caroline was trying to get Jack's attention. The author mentions that Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul, which might have been a red herring. If the author had no reason to suspect that Caroline was interested in Jack, then they might not be at fault. However, if Caroline was being deceptive or if there were clues the author could have picked up on, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that Caroline planned the trip to see if Jack still felt something for her might be a point. But the author wasn't aware of that. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, who was interested in them. \n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual interest. If Jack and the author were both interested in each other, then their relationship is valid. The problem here is Caroline's expectations and her belief that the author should have known about her feelings. Since the author didn't know, and Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul) could have been misleading, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nCaroline's reaction seems more about her own actions\u2014using Paul to get Jack's attention\u2014and then being upset when someone else (the author) formed a relationship with Jack. The author might have been an innocent party here, unaware of Caroline's motivations. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had no way of knowing Caroline's secret motives and acted on mutual interest with Jack. Caroline's actions were deceptive, and the author isn't responsible for not reading her mind.\n"
