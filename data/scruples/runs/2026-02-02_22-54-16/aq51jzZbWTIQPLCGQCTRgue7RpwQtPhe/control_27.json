I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline, who ended up hooking up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author ended up connecting with Jack, and they had a relationship. Now Caroline is upset and wants an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The key points are: Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school, planned the trip to see if Jack still felt that way, and used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and ended up hooking up with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. \n\nSo, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions. Caroline's actions were deceptive because she was trying to manipulate the situation with Paul to get Jack's attention. The author was just following along, getting to know Jack when Caroline was occupied with Paul. \n\nBut wait, was the author aware that Caroline had feelings for Jack? The story says the author didn't know until after hooking up with Jack. The author thought Caroline was interested in Paul. If the author had no way of knowing about Caroline's crush on Jack, then how could they be in the wrong? \n\nCaroline's main issue seems to be that she wanted to manipulate the situation to get Jack back and the author interfered by taking Jack. But since Caroline was actively trying to use Paul to get Jack's attention, maybe she's the one who's in the wrong. The author just had a relationship with someone who was available, not knowing about Caroline's past.\n\nBut maybe the author should have considered Caroline's feelings if Jack was part of her past. However, since Caroline didn't disclose her intentions, the author couldn't have known. The author's actions were based on the current situation, not prior knowledge of Caroline's crush.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Caroline's behavior was manipulative and deceptive. The author had no knowledge of her intentions and acted based on the current interactions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Caroline is upset because her plan backfired, but that's her own doing. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's manipulative actions.\n"
