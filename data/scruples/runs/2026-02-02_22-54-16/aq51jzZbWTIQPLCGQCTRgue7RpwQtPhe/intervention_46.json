I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack and his friends. During the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they slept together. When the author told Caroline, she got really upset because she had a crush on Jack back in high school and thought the trip was a way to see if Jack still felt that way. She was using Paul to make Jack jealous, but the author didn't know that. Now Caroline is upset and wants an apology.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nCaroline's actions: She invited the author on the trip, reconnected with Jack, then started a fling with Paul. She didn't communicate her true intentions (like her crush on Jack) to the author. She used Paul to try to get Jack's attention, but kept that to herself. \n\nAuthor's actions: The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. The author interacted with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. The author formed a connection with Jack and had a relationship. The author didn't have any reason to know about Caroline's hidden agenda because she never communicated it. \n\nFrom a friendship standpoint, Caroline might be at fault for not being upfront. The author was a friend, so Caroline's expectations of the author knowing her unspoken intentions might be unreasonable. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline was trying to get Jack's attention through Paul. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything to prevent Caroline from pursuing Paul. If anything, Caroline was the one who was with Paul, leaving the author to interact with Jack. The author's actions were based on the situation as it was presented, without hidden knowledge.\n\nBut maybe there's a social expectation that friends shouldn't date someone their friend has a crush on, even if the friend didn't disclose it. However, in this case, Caroline didn't communicate her feelings, so the author couldn't have known. The author isn't responsible for reading minds or knowing Caroline's unexpressed intentions.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe Caroline's plan was manipulative. She used Paul to compete with Jack, which might have been unfair to both Paul and Jack. But the author's role here was just to be there and form a connection with Jack. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the necessary information to know about Caroline's intentions. The responsibility for communication lies with Caroline. The author acted based on the available information and the interactions during the trip. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
