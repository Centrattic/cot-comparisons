I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline, who reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school exchange in Germany. They met Paul, Caroline hooked up with him, and the author ended up getting close to Jack. Eventually, they slept together, which made Caroline upset because she had a crush on Jack from five years ago and was using Paul to make him jealous.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break down the key points.\n\nCaroline's actions: She went to Germany to reconnect with Jack, had a crush on him, and used Paul to make Jack jealous. She didn't inform the author about her feelings or intentions. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and her strategy with Paul. The author and Jack developed a connection while Caroline was focused on Paul. The author slept with Jack, which Caroline took as a betrayal.\n\nEthically, cheating isn't an issue here because there were no prior relationships involved. The main issue is whether the author was aware of Caroline's intentions. Since Caroline didn't disclose her feelings towards Jack, the author couldn't have known. The author's actions were based on their own interactions with Jack, not knowing Caroline's history with him.\n\nCaroline's main grievance is that the author didn't realize her true intentions. However, it's unreasonable to expect the author to have known Caroline's hidden agenda without her revealing it. The author had no obligation to prevent Caroline's jealousy tactics or to stay away from Jack based on unspoken history.\n\nThe argument could be made that the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's behavior, but Caroline was actively hiding her true feelings and using Paul, which the author couldn't have been privy to. The author acted on their own connection with Jack, which isn't inherently wrong unless there were explicit boundaries set beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, since the author wasn't aware of Caroline's plans and there was no indication they should have been, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with Caroline for not being transparent about her intentions.\n"
