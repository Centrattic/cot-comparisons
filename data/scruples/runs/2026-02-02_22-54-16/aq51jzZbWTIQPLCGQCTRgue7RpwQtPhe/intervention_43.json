I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. The situation involves a trip to Germany where Caroline reconnects with Jack and others. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. Caroline brought the author on the trip, met Jack again, then started flirting with Paul. She ignored the author, hooked up with Paul, and during the trip, the author and Jack got close. On the last night, the author and Jack slept together, which made Caroline angry.\n\nCaroline claims she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still felt the same. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know this and thought Caroline was genuinely interested in Paul. After the trip, Caroline is upset and demands an apology.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author was left alone with Jack, and they formed a connection. Caroline's actions, like using Paul to get closer to Jack, might be manipulative. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's hidden motives. The author acted on mutual feelings without knowing about Caroline's intentions. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
