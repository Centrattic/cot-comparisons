I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who slept with Jack) is in the wrong. So I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school days. She also met Paul, someone Jack knows. Caroline clearly started flirting with Paul, ignored the author, and ended up hooking up with Paul. Then, during the trip, the author got close to Jack, and they ended up sleeping together. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known she was trying to get his attention through Paul. She claims she planned the trip to reconnect with Jack.\n\nSo, from the author's side, they didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They thought Caroline was interested in Paul. The author felt close to Jack and acted on their feelings. Caroline's reaction was harsh, and she's been demanding an apology. The author refuses because they didn't know about her intentions.\n\nNow, considering the rules of friendship and relationships. Friends typically don't interfere in each other's romantic pursuits unless there's something explicit. But Caroline's actions here are a bit confusing. She's flirting with Paul, leading the author to think that's where her interest lies. The author, being in a different situation, doesn't have any reason to know about Caroline's feelings towards Jack. So, from a naive perspective, the author is in the right because they didn't have the necessary information to know that Caroline's actions were a ploy to get Jack's attention. Caroline might be at fault for not being clear about her intentions, and for using Paul as a distraction. The author acted on their own feelings without knowing the backstories. \n\nBut maybe there's something else. Did Caroline give any hints that Jack was the real target? The author says Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul and ignoring others. So the author had no reason to suspect that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Caroline's reaction is more about her own mixed signals and perhaps poor communication. The author isn't responsible for reading Caroline's mind. Hence, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
