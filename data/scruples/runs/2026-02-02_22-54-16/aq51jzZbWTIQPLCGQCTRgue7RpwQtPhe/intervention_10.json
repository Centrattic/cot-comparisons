I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, got together with him, and then the author ended up hooking up with Jack, who was Paul's friend. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have realized that. Now Caroline is angry and wants an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was invited by Caroline. Caroline was the one who initiated the connection with Paul, and she was heavily flirting with him. The author ended up spending time with Jack, who was a friend of Paul, and eventually hooked up. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and thought they were helping her by connecting with Paul to maybe make Jack jealous. However, the author didn't do anything to prevent their own relationship with Jack. \n\nWait, but Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous, right? She didn't tell the author about her feelings for Jack. The author had no way of knowing that. So, the author's actions weren't malicious. They were just forming a relationship with someone else, which is their right unless there were boundaries set beforehand.\n\nCaroline's actions might be the problem here. She didn't communicate her intentions clearly. She used the trip to get close to Paul, which backfired because the author ended up with Jack. But the author didn't know about Caroline's crush. So the author isn't in the wrong because they had no information to act differently. Also, Caroline was the one who was deceptive about her own motives. She planned the trip to see if Jack had feelings for her, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's mistake, if any, was maybe not being aware of Caroline's hidden agenda, but that's not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
