I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with her friend Jack from her high school days there. She also met Paul, whom she immediately started flirting with and ended up hooking up with. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they had a fling. Caroline got really upset and blames the author for this, thinking she was trying to interfere with her plan to get back with Jack.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author was invited by Caroline and met Jack through her. Caroline was the one who introduced the author to the group, including Paul. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack initially. The author and Jack became close while Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't know Caroline's hidden agenda to get back with Jack. So, the key points here are whether the author had any prior knowledge of Caroline's intentions and if the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nCaroline's actions: She planned the trip with the intention of seeing if Jack still had feelings for her. She used Paul as a distraction to maybe provoke Jack. The author had no way of knowing this. The author's interaction with Jack happened while Caroline was with Paul. The author didn't do anything to interfere with Caroline's plans because she was unaware of them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't know Caroline's intentions, so they couldn't have been trying to ruin her plans. The author and Jack were both adults, and they chose to be together. Since Caroline was with Paul and not Jack, the author's relationship with Jack isn't necessarily interfering with a current relationship. It's more of a past crush that Caroline was trying to rekindle. The author didn't have any obligation to know Caroline's motivations unless she communicated them. \n\nHowever, one could argue that maybe the author should have been more cautious, but there's no indication that the author did anything to make Caroline feel that way. Caroline's anger seems to stem from her own plans backfiring, not from the author's direct interference beyond her own manipulative setup. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
