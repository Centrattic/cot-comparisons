I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend named Caroline who invited the author to Germany. There, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and the author ends up getting close to Jack, Caroline's high school crush. The author then sleeps with Jack, and Caroline is upset because she had a crush on him and thought the author should have known not to go after him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Caroline's actions: she invited the author, connected with Jack's group, started flirting with Paul, and maybe manipulated the author into being with Jack to make Paul jealous. The author, unaware of Caroline's intentions, formed a connection with Jack. The conflict arises because Caroline was using Paul to get to Jack, and the author didn't know that.\n\nThe author's perspective: They didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They had no way of knowing that Caroline's actions were to test Jack's feelings. The author felt they were just being friendly with Jack while Caroline was with Paul. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she led the author on, and the author had no insight into her hidden motives.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't intentionally betray Caroline. They were acting on their own feelings and connections made during the trip. Caroline's manipulation and lack of transparency are key here. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's secret agenda. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't have known about Caroline's intentions. Caroline's actions were deceptive, leading to the conflict. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
