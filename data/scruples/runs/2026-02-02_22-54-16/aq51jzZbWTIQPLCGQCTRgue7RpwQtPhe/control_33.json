I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who slept with the college friend's high school crush) is in the wrong. The situation involves a trip to Germany where Caroline, the college friend, reconnects with Jack, her high school crush, and invites the author along. During the trip, Caroline is heavily flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and ends up ignoring the author. Meanwhile, the author gets close to Jack and eventually sleeps with him. Caroline gets angry, claims she was trying to win Jack back, and is upset the author didn't realize her intentions. The author refuses to apologize, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack five years ago and went to Germany to see him. She then went on a trip with the author, met Jack again, and instead of directly pursuing Jack, she started flirting with Paul, who isn't her crush. The author, meanwhile, grew close to Jack and ended up hooking up with him. Caroline's main grievance is that the author didn't realize she was targeting Jack and instead took the opportunity to sleep with him. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author acted inappropriately by sleeping with Jack, not considering that Caroline had a crush on him. But here's the catch: the author had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. Caroline was openly with Paul, even hooking up with him. The author became close to Jack because Caroline was neglecting the author and others. The author didn't know about Caroline's plan to reconnect with Jack. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author couldn't have known Caroline was using Paul to get back at Jack. The author's actions were based on genuine connection with Jack, not knowing Caroline's ulterior motives. Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous might be questionable, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author isn't in the wrong because they had no knowledge of Caroline's intentions and acted based on the situation as they saw it. \n\nHowever, another angle is whether the author should have been more aware of Caroline's feelings. But Caroline didn't communicate her intentions to the author. The author's responsibility is to their own actions, and since they didn't know, they can't be blamed for not anticipating Caroline's hidden agenda. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They didn't know about Caroline's crush and acted based on the interactions they had during the trip.\n"
