I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline had a high school crush on someone named Jack, and during this trip, she ended up with another guy, Paul, while the author got to know Jack. Eventually, the author hooked up with Jack, and Caroline was really upset about it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to look at the facts. Caroline invited the author on the trip, and during the trip, she started flirting with Paul. The author ended up spending time with Jack and then slept with him. Caroline had a crush on Jack from high school and claims she was trying to make Jack jealous by being with Paul. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack and thought they were just a friend.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, manipulation, and betrayal. Caroline was the one who invited the author and then started this whole thing with Paul. But she had her own agenda with Jack. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions because she didn't communicate that. The author ended up forming a relationship with Jack, who was available and interested. \n\nIs the author at fault for not knowing Caroline's secret crush? Probably not. The author didn't manipulate or deceive Jack. They were in a situation where they were getting to know someone new. Caroline, on the other hand, might have manipulated the situation by using Paul to get back at Jack. The author's actions were based on what was presented to them, which was that Caroline was interested in Paul.\n\nCaroline's anger seems to stem from her own actions and unspoken expectations. She didn't clarify her feelings towards Jack or communicate her intentions, which led to the conflict. The author didn't have any obligation to know about Caroline's past feelings unless she had explicitly told them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and manipulating the situation. The author acted based on the information they had at the time, which didn't include Caroline's secret crush. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
