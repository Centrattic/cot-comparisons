I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with Jack, a friend of their college friend Caroline. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Caroline invited the author to Germany. There, Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul, hooked up with him, and ignored the author. Meanwhile, the author got closer to Jack, and eventually had a one-night stand with him. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known she was trying to get him back instead of being with Paul.\n\nThe author's actions: They didn't know Caroline's plans. Caroline was the one who was leading Paul on, and the author was with Jack during that time. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack until after the fact. Caroline's anger seems to stem from her own manipulative behavior\u2014using Paul to get Jack's attention, and then getting upset when the author ended up with Jack.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. They were just getting to know Jack, and it was a consensual relationship. Caroline's actions were more deceptive\u2014she planned the trip with ulterior motives and then blamed the author for her own failed attempt to win back Jack. \n\nThe author didn't do anything wrong by having a relationship with Jack, especially since they weren't aware of Caroline's history with him. Caroline's anger is misplaced. So, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
