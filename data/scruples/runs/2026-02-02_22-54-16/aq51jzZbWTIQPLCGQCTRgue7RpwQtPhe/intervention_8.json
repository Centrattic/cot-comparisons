I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush, Jack. The situation involves a trip to Germany where Caroline (the friend) reconnects with Jack and a friend of his named Paul. Caroline ends up flirting with Paul, they hook up, and the author ends up getting close to Jack and having sex with him. Caroline then gets angry and demands an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries and expectations in the situation. Caroline was the one who invited the author on the trip, and during the trip, she was actively flirting with Paul and ignoring the author. The author ended up spending time with Jack, and after Caroline was with Paul, the author and Jack hooked up. \n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author had a reasonable expectation that Jack was available. Caroline had a history with Jack from high school, but she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. However, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions until after the fact. The author was led to believe that Caroline was interested in Paul, given how she was acting. The author and Jack became close during the trip, and the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack at the time. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a situation where they were socializing with a group, and they formed a connection with Jack. Since Caroline was with Paul and the author didn't know about her past feelings for Jack, there's a case to be made that the author acted without malicious intent. \n\nOn the other hand, Caroline's actions might be seen as manipulative. She planned the trip to Germany to reconnect with Jack, used Paul to try to get a reaction, and then blamed the author for the outcome. The author's actions might be considered a betrayal of trust, as they were friends with Caroline and the author ended up with someone she was interested in. However, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions, so they might not have the same level of responsibility here.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"friends\" and how the author's relationship with Caroline played a role. If they were close friends, the author might have been expected to be more cautious, but the story suggests that Caroline was the one who was leading the author to meet people and was the one who was actively involved with Paul first. The author's connection with Jack happened in the context of Caroline's own actions with Paul, which could imply that the author was in a more neutral position.\n\nThe question is also about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack at the time, and Jack was part of the group they were all socializing with, there's an argument that the author wasn't at fault. The responsibility could lie more with Caroline for not being honest about her intentions and for manipulating the situation. The author's refusal to apologize seems justified if they acted without malice and were unaware of the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author didn't have the knowledge of Caroline's feelings and acted in a situation that was presented as a mutual social event. Caroline's actions in using Paul and her subsequent blame on the author might be more at issue here.\n"
