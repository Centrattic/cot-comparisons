I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who planned a trip to Germany to reconnect with her high school crush, Jack. The author went along, met Jack's friend Paul, and ended up hooking up with Jack instead. The friend, Caroline, got really upset and is still mad, claiming the author ruined the trip by not figuring out her true intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. Caroline invited the author on the trip. During the trip, Caroline was heavily flirting with Paul, ignoring the author, and eventually hooked up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually had a relationship with him. Caroline is now angry because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have realized that.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author know about Caroline's crush on Jack? The author claims they didn't. Caroline didn't make that clear during the trip. The author was just following the interactions as they happened. Also, Caroline was the one who was actively pursuing Paul and ignoring the author, so maybe she didn't give clear signals about her interest in Jack. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author do anything to actively sabotage Caroline's plans? It seems like Caroline's plan was to be with Paul to make Jack jealous, but the author ended up with Jack. However, the author didn't know about Caroline's intentions, so they couldn't have intentionally interfered. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip.\n\nAlso, Caroline's behavior during the trip doesn't indicate she wanted the author to know about her feelings for Jack. If she had communicated her intentions clearly, maybe the author could have acted differently. But since she didn't, the author isn't to blame for not knowing. \n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's possible feelings. But given that Caroline was focusing on Paul and the author had no reason to suspect her true feelings for Jack, it's not reasonable to expect the author to have known. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author didn't do anything wrong. Caroline's anger stems from her own unclear communication and the author's lack of knowledge about her hidden agenda. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
