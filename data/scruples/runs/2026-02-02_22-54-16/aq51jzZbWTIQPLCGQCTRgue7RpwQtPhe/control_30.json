I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a trip to Germany with a friend, Caroline, and her reconnecting with Jack, a friend from high school. The author ends up sleeping with Jack, which upsets Caroline a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Caroline had a crush on Jack in high school and went to Germany for a study program. Then, years later, she invites her college friend (the author) to Germany, meets up with Jack again. Caroline starts flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ends up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author is spending time with Jack, and they become close, leading to them sleeping together. Caroline is furious and demands an apology, saying the author ruined the trip and was a slut, among other things.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. From the author's side, they didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. The author was just going along with the plan, meeting people, and forming a connection with Jack. The author didn't have any indication that Caroline wanted to get back with Jack, only that she was trying to make Jack jealous by hooking up with Paul. The author didn't intentionally interfere with Caroline's plans if they weren't aware of them.\n\nOn the other hand, Caroline planned the trip with the intention of reconnecting with Jack. She might have expected the author to help in that, or at least not to take Jack for herself. But Caroline's actions with Paul could be seen as trying to manipulate the situation, which might have led the author to feel like it was acceptable to pursue Jack. The author could argue they were not aware of Caroline's intentions and acted on their own feelings. However, if Caroline made it clear that Jack was her target, the author might be at fault for not respecting that.\n\nBut in the story, Caroline didn't tell the author about her crush or her plan to reconnect with Jack. The author only found out after the fact. So the author couldn't have known. Therefore, the author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. Caroline's anger seems to stem from her own actions and the author's not aligning with her secret plan. The author didn't do anything that was against their knowledge. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a friend, the author should have been more perceptive or that Caroline's intentions were obvious. But since the author didn't know, it's hard to hold them responsible. The fault might lie more with Caroline for not being transparent and for using Paul to make Jack jealous, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's actions were a natural outcome of the social dynamics they were part of without malicious intent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They didn't know about Caroline's crush and acted on their own connection. Caroline's anger comes from her own secret plans and expectations that weren't communicated. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
