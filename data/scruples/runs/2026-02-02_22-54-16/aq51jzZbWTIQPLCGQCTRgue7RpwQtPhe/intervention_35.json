I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, Caroline invited the author to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school days, and wanted to meet him. The author agreed. Then, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, Jack's friend, and ended up hooking up with him. During the rest of the trip, Caroline kept seeing Paul while the author hung out with Jack. By the end, the author and Jack hooked up when Paul and Caroline were out. \n\nCaroline got angry because she had a crush on Jack back when she studied in Germany and thought the author should have known she was trying to get Jack jealous by being with Paul. She's upset the author slept with Jack instead. The author doesn't apologize and feels Caroline planned the trip to check on Jack.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and expectations. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline was the one who was pursuing Paul, and the author ended up with Jack when Caroline wasn't around. Caroline's anger seems to stem from her own manipulative behavior\u2014using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. \n\nAlso, Caroline's actions of making out with Paul while the author was with Jack might have set things up. If Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous, maybe she should have been clearer about her feelings. The author wasn't in on that plan, so it's not their fault. They acted on their own feelings once they developed. \n\nBut wait, was the author maybe aware of Caroline's crush on Jack? The story says Caroline's behavior with Paul was to make Jack jealous, and the author was with Jack. But the author claims they didn't know. So unless there was some prior knowledge, the author isn't at fault. \n\nCaroline's demands for an apology and the accusations seem misplaced since the author didn't have intent to hurt Caroline's plans. It's Caroline who manipulated the situation by using Paul. The author had no way of knowing about the crush, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
