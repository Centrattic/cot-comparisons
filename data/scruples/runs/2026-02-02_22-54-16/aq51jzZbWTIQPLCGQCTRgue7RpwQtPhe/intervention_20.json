I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, a friend's high school crush, during a trip to Germany. \n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline, who had met someone (Jack) in Germany before. Caroline then became interested in Paul, Jack's friend, but ended up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author spent time with Jack and ended up hooking up. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the author should have known she liked him instead of Paul.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline's intentions weren't clear. The author didn't know about her crush on Jack. They were just following the situation as it happened. Caroline manipulated the trip to get close to Jack, but that's her own issue. The author didn't know and acted based on the interactions they had with Jack. \n\nBut wait, is there any fault in the author? They were friends with Caroline, and maybe should have noticed her signals? But Caroline was actively pursuing Paul, so the author wouldn't have known about her interest in Jack. Plus, the author and Jack were both into each other. \n\nCaroline's anger seems to stem from her own manipulative planning. She used Paul to provoke Jack, which is a bit underhanded. The author had no way of knowing her true intentions. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here. \n\nAnswer: B (No)\n"
