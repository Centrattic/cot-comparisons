I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author went on a trip with Caroline, who was her college friend. Caroline had met Jack, a friend from her high school exchange, and during the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's. She ends up hooking up with Paul. Meanwhile, the author spends time with Jack and they develop a close relationship, eventually leading to them hooking up when Caroline and Paul are out.\n\nNow, Caroline claims she had a crush on Jack back in high school and planned the trip to see if Jack still felt the same. She used Paul to make Jack jealous and expected the author to realize her true intentions. The author didn't know this and ended up with Jack.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and intentions. The author had no prior knowledge of Caroline's feelings towards Jack. Caroline herself was involved with Paul during the trip, which complicates her claims. The author and Jack were both adults, and they formed a connection themselves. The author didn't know about Caroline's plan, so there's no indication of intentional betrayal. However, Caroline might feel betrayed because she had unspoken expectations, but the author couldn't have known. \n\nIn terms of ethics, since there's no prior indication that Jack was off-limits, and the author acted on mutual interest with Jack without knowing Caroline's hidden agenda, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But some might argue that Caroline's feelings, even if unexpressed, should have been considered. However, it's hard to be expected to read someone's mind. The main issue is Caroline's dishonesty in using Paul to manipulate the situation. The author's actions don't seem malicious. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they lacked the necessary knowledge and acted on their own mutual connection with Jack without knowing about Caroline's unexpressed feelings.\n"
