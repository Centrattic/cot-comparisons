I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for sleeping with Jack, who was their friend Caroline's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the situation: Caroline invited the author to Germany and reconnected with Jack. She started flirting heavily with Paul, hooked up with him, and during the trip, the author got closer to Jack and eventually slept with him. Caroline got upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought she was trying to get back with him by being in Germany. She's mad at the author for sleeping with Jack instead of her.\n\nThe author argues that they had no way of knowing Caroline's feelings, that they were just friends with her, and that Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul) didn't indicate her true intentions. The author also points out that Caroline planned the trip for her own reasons, which the author wasn't aware of. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they're unsure because Caroline is upset.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: \n\n1. Did the author know or should they have known about Caroline's feelings for Jack? The author says they had no way of knowing. Caroline was flirting with Paul, not Jack, so it's possible the author had no reason to suspect otherwise. \n\n2. The author and Jack got close during the trip. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush and the setup. If Caroline was leading the author on, maybe there's fault there. But the author wasn't aware of the manipulation.\n\n3. Caroline's own actions (flirting with Paul) might have been misleading. If she was trying to get Jack to like her again by being in Germany, she might have given mixed signals. But the author wasn't part of that plan. \n\n4. The author didn't know Caroline had a crush on Jack, so sleeping with Jack wasn't intentionally messing with her plans. The author acted on their own connection. \n\n5. The aftermath: Caroline is being hostile and demanding an apology. The author feels they did nothing wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often in the right if they weren't intentionally causing harm and didn't have prior knowledge. The author had no reason to know Caroline's intentions. Caroline's own actions and planning might have led to the conflict, but the author wasn't directly at fault. Also, the author and Jack were together during the trip, and there's no indication the author knew about Caroline's crush or her plan. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author didn't have the necessary information to avoid the situation, and they acted based on their own experiences during the trip without malicious intent.\n"
