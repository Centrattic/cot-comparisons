I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with her friend Jack, and there was another guy named Paul. Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, ignoring the author, and they ended up hooking up. Then, during the trip, the author and Jack got close and ended up sleeping together. Caroline found out and flipped out, accusing the author of being a slut, and is still upset a month later. The author refuses to apologize, thinking they had no way of knowing Caroline's feelings for Jack.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. Caroline's intentions: she had a crush on Jack 5 years ago and planned the trip to see if he still felt the same. She used Paul to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and thought she was interested in Paul. The author and Jack had a connection and ended up sleeping together.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's feelings for Jack. They were on a trip with their friend, met Jack through Caroline's introduction, and developed a relationship with him. The author didn't know Caroline's plan to use Paul to get Jack's attention. So from the author's perspective, they had no reason to suspect that Caroline had any romantic interest in Jack beyond what she was showing with Paul.\n\nCaroline's reaction seems more about her own actions and miscommunication. She led the author to believe she was interested in Paul, and the author acted on a relationship with Jack, who was available and interested. The author didn't intentionally interfere with Caroline's plans because they were unaware. Also, Caroline's claim that the author should have known she liked Jack seems unfair because there's no evidence the author had any indication. The author didn't have access to Caroline's internal thoughts or her plan to use Paul.\n\nAnother angle: relationships and boundaries. If Caroline had made it clear she had feelings for Jack, the author might have acted differently. But since Caroline was actively pursuing Paul and ignoring the author, the author had no reason to think there was any issue with getting close to Jack. Plus, Jack wasn't in a relationship, so from the author's perspective, there's nothing wrong with forming a connection with someone who's single.\n\nCaroline's ongoing anger seems misplaced. The author isn't responsible for Caroline's failed attempt to relight an old crush. The author's actions were based on the information available at the time. The fact that Caroline is still demanding an apology after a month without the author having done anything ethically wrong might indicate that Caroline is projecting her own guilt or frustration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have knowledge of Caroline's intentions, acted on their own connection with Jack, and there's no indication they betrayed Caroline in any way. Caroline's actions involved deception by using Paul and not being honest about her feelings for Jack. The author's relationship with Jack was consensual and based on mutual interest at the time.\n"
