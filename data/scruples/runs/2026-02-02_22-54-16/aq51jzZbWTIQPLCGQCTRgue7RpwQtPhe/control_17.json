I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her time studying there, and also met Paul. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, ignoring the author and others, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author got to know Jack and ended up sleeping with him. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. Now she's angry at the author for being with Jack.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. She didn't mention it to the author, so there's no way the author could have known. The author spent time with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. The connection between the author and Jack happened naturally during the trip. The author didn't know Caroline was using Paul as a ploy to get Jack's attention. \n\nCaroline's actions might be questionable. She didn't communicate her intentions to the author. If she was using Paul to make Jack jealous, that's her own strategy, and the author wasn't involved in that. The author's relationship with Jack happened when Caroline was occupied with Paul. The author didn't know about the crush, so there's no deceit on their part. \n\nCaroline is now angry and demanding an apology, but the author isn't at fault because they couldn't have known. The author isn't in the wrong for forming a connection with Jack in a situation where Caroline's own actions led to her being unavailable. The trip was Caroline's idea, and she didn't clarify her feelings towards Jack with the author beforehand. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
