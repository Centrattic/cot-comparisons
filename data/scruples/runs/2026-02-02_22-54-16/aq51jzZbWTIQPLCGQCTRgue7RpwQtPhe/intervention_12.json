I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with Jack, her high school crush from five years ago. Then Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author interacted with Jack and they became close. The author ended up hooking up with Jack when Caroline was busy with Paul. Caroline got angry, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still liked her. She also said she used Paul to make Jack jealous and expected the author to realize she wanted Jack, not Paul. \n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, expectations, and manipulation. Did Caroline set up the trip with the intention of getting back with Jack? If she planned the trip specifically for that, maybe she didn't make that clear to the author. Also, she was actively pursuing Paul as a method to make Jack jealous. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions because she was clearly with Paul. The author formed a connection with Jack independently, and the hook-up happened when Caroline was with Paul. \n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? If Caroline was using Paul as a distraction to get Jack's attention, but didn't communicate that to the author, then the author isn't responsible for not reading her mind. The author didn't know about Caroline's plans and was being genuine in their interactions with Jack. Plus, the author didn't know Jack had any feelings for Caroline since Caroline was with Paul. \n\nCaroline's anger seems to stem from her own manipulative actions not yielding the desired result. The author wasn't aware of her true motives and acted on their own feelings. Since the author had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions and didn't interfere with any existing relationships (since Caroline was already with Paul), it's likely the author isn't at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue here is Caroline's manipulation and lack of clear communication, not the author's actions.\n"
