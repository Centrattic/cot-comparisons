I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with their friend Caroline to Germany. Caroline reconnected with a friend, Jack, and introduced the author to Jack's group. Caroline started heavily flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author got closer to Jack, and they ended up sleeping together. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school, planned the trip to see if he still had feelings, and thought the author should have known Jack was her target.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Caroline's intention with the trip, her actions with Paul, the author's interactions with Jack, and the aftermath. The main question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack when Caroline had a crush on him.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. She was actively with Paul, so it's unclear if the author had reason to suspect Caroline's true intentions. The author didn't know Jack was her crush until after the fact. Since the author couldn't have known, their actions might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have been more perceptive, but that's a high standard. Also, Caroline's behavior with Paul was a red flag, but the author might not have realized she was using Paul to get to Jack. The author's actions were consensual and based on their own connection with Jack. Caroline's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate her feelings to the author. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. The responsibility lies with Caroline for not being clear about her feelings towards Jack. The author acted on genuine connections formed during the trip without prior knowledge of Caroline's plan.\n"
