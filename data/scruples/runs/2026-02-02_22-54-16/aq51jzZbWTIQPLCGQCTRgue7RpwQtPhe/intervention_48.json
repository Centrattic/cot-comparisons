I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author went on a trip to Germany with Caroline. She reconnected with Paul and Jack, her friend from her high school study program. Caroline heavily flirted with Paul, hooked up with him, and the author ended up bonding with Jack. On the last night, the author and Jack slept together. The next day, Caroline lost it because she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's been upset ever since, demanding an apology.\n\nThe author thinks they aren't in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nCaroline's actions: She invited the author on the trip. She openly flirted with Paul, ignored the author, and actively sought him out. She didn't mention her feelings for Jack to the author before the trip. The author had no way of knowing Caroline's plan to rekindle her crush on Jack. \n\nThe author didn't know about Caroline's feelings. They were just getting to know Jack when Caroline was busy with Paul. The author and Jack connected, leading to them sleeping together. The author didn't know that Caroline was using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author was a participant in the social group, and Jack was part of the group. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip, not prior knowledge of Caroline's secret intentions.\n\nCaroline's reaction seems to stem from the fact that she didn't communicate her true intentions. The author had no way of knowing Jack was the target of her crush. The author's actions were not deceptive; they were forming a relationship with Jack while Caroline was focused on Paul. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author had any obligation to avoid Jack because of Caroline's unexpressed feelings. Since Caroline didn't communicate her interest in Jack or her plan to use the trip to reconnect with him, the author couldn't have known. \n\nCaroline's actions might be more problematic because she didn't set boundaries or communicate her intentions. She's upset that the author didn't act as a gatekeeper for her unexpressed crush. However, friends aren't expected to know each other's secret crushes unless they're explicitly shared. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they acted without knowledge of Caroline's intentions. Caroline's planning a trip to Germany specifically to check on her high school crush could be seen as manipulative, especially since she didn't mention it to the author. The author had no reason to avoid Jack, given that Caroline was already involved with Paul during the trip. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't at fault because they couldn't have known Caroline's true intentions. Caroline's anger is misplaced, as the author had no way of preventing the situation given the lack of communication.\n"
