I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author went on a trip to Germany with their college friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline met Jack, a friend from her high school program in Germany. Caroline then started flirting with Paul, one of Jack's friends, and ended up hooking up with him. The author spent time with Jack, and eventually they hooked up. When the author told Caroline about sleeping with Jack, Caroline flipped out, saying she had a crush on Jack from high school and used the trip to see if he still liked her. Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous. Now, Caroline is still mad and wants an apology, but the author refuses.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Caroline's intentions: She had a crush on Jack from high school and planned the trip to see if he still had feelings. She then pursued Paul to make Jack jealous but didn't end up with him. The author didn't know about Caroline's plan and ended up with Jack. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing Caroline's intentions. They were just getting to know Jack, and the relationship developed naturally. The author didn't know that Caroline was using Paul as a tactic. So, the author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip without any prior knowledge of Caroline's plan.\n\nCaroline, on the other hand, manipulated the situation by using Paul to get Jack's attention. She didn't inform the author about her feelings for Jack, leading the author to form a relationship with him. Now, Caroline is upset because the author didn't realize her plan and ended up with Jack. \n\nThe key points here are consent and knowledge. The author didn't have any information about Caroline's intentions towards Jack. They were not aware that Caroline was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author and Jack formed a connection during the trip, which led to them sleeping together. There's no indication that the author was intentionally trying to interfere with Caroline's plans. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author should have been more attentive to Caroline's possible feelings, but since Caroline never communicated them, the author couldn't have known. The responsibility here might lie more with Caroline for not making her intentions clear. The author had no way of knowing that Caroline was trying to rekindle a relationship with Jack, so they aren't in the wrong for pursuing their own connection with him. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't at fault because they acted on their own experiences and didn't have the necessary information to know Caroline's intentions. Caroline's manipulation and lack of communication are the real issues here.\n"
