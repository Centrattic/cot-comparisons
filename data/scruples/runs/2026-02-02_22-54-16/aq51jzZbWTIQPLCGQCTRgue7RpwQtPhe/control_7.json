I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend Caroline's high school crush, Jack.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. Caroline, the college friend, invited the author on a trip to Germany. During the trip, Caroline met up with Jack, her high school crush from a program she did in Germany years ago. Caroline then started heavily flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. Meanwhile, the author ended up getting close to Jack and they had a relationship. When the author told Caroline about sleeping with Jack, Caroline became upset, claiming she had a crush on Jack and planned the trip to see if he still felt the same. She also said she only went with Paul to make Jack jealous and accused the author of ruining the trip.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and intentions. Caroline and the author were both there, and Caroline was the one who initiated contact with Paul. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and had no way of knowing. Caroline's actions (flirting with Paul) might have led the author to believe that Jack was available. However, Caroline's hidden plan to rekindle her high school crush complicates things.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they were following the lead given by Caroline. If Caroline was the one who introduced the author to Jack and didn't mention her feelings for him during the trip, the author isn't necessarily at fault for forming a connection with Jack based on his availability. The author didn't know about Caroline's history with Jack and her intentions. It's possible that Caroline's actions were misleading, using Paul to get Jack's attention, but that doesn't make the author wrong for forming a relationship with Jack if Jack was interested and it was consensual.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have been more aware of Caroline's feelings. However, Caroline didn't communicate her intentions clearly. The author couldn't have known about her crush on Jack, so they had no reason to avoid Jack. The responsibility might lie with Caroline for not being upfront about her intentions. The author's actions were based on the interactions during the trip, which seemed to suggest Jack was a potential partner.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information available to them at the time and had no prior knowledge of Caroline's plan. The conflict arises from Caroline's unspoken expectations and her use of the trip for personal reasons without transparency. The author isn't obligated to apologize for a consensual relationship that resulted from the circumstances presented during the trip. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
