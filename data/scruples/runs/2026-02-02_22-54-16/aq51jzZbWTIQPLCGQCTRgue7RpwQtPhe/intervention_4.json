I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the author (the person who slept with Jack) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a college friend, Caroline, who invited the author to Germany. There, Caroline reconnects with Paul and Jack. She starts flirting heavily with Paul, hooks up with him, and throughout the trip, uses Paul to get close to Jack, her high school crush. The author ends up getting close to Jack and they sleep together. Caroline gets upset, accusing the author of ruining the trip and using the author as a pawn.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. Caroline's intentions were hidden; she was pretending to be interested in Paul to make Jack jealous. The author had no way of knowing this. So, from the author's perspective, they were just being genuine in their interactions with Jack. They didn't know they were stepping on Caroline's plans.\n\nCaroline's actions here are a bit manipulative. She led the author to believe that her interest in Paul was genuine, and she used the trip to rekindle her feelings with Jack. The author wasn't aware of this and acted based on the information available. The key point is that the author didn't have malicious intent. They formed a connection with Jack, who was available and interested. \n\nHowever, there's a possible issue of friend dynamics. The author was with Caroline's friend Jack, but there's no indication that Jack was in a relationship or that Caroline had discussed this with Jack beforehand. Jack was the one who came along with Paul, so maybe he was single and available. \n\nCaroline's anger stems from her manipulation backfiring. She used Paul as a means to an end, which is manipulative in itself. The author, not being aware of this, acted on their feelings with Jack. It's possible that Caroline's actions were the main issue here, expecting the author to read her mind or know her hidden agenda. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the knowledge to avoid the situation. Caroline's planning the trip with the sole purpose of checking on Jack's feelings is questionable. The author's refusal to apologize is justified because they didn't do anything that was intentionally harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The fault lies more with Caroline for manipulating the situation and not being honest about her intentions.\n"
