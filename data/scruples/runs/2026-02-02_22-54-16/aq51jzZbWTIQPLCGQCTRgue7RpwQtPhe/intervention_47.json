I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went on a trip with Caroline, who invited them. They met Jack, and Caroline started flirting with Paul, another friend, during the trip. Meanwhile, the author ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have realized she was trying to get Jack's attention by being with Paul.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong. Caroline had a crush on Jack back in high school and went on a trip to reconnect with him, but instead, she ended up with Paul and got upset when the author ended up with Jack. The author argues they had no way of knowing Caroline's plan and that they were just getting to know Jack during the trip.\n\nI need to consider if the author had any obligation to know Caroline's intentions. Caroline didn't make her feelings towards Jack clear. The author wasn't aware of her plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous. The author and Jack formed a connection on their own, without knowing Caroline's past crush. It seems like Caroline might have mismanaged her own emotions and expectations. The author didn't do anything to intentionally interfere; they were just following their own relationship with Jack. Caroline's reaction seems a bit unfair because the author couldn't have known her hidden agenda. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
