I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with their friend Caroline's high school crush. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Caroline invited the person to Germany and reconnected with Jack, her high school crush. But during the trip, Caroline started flirting heavily with Paul instead, hooked up with him, and ignored the person. Meanwhile, the person ended up spending time with Jack and eventually slept with him. Caroline got angry because she had a crush on Jack and was using Paul to make him jealous. She's now upset and demanding an apology.\n\nSo, the key points here: Caroline didn't inform the person about her past feelings for Jack. She was with Paul, but maybe she was just trying to get Jack's attention. The person didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack because she never mentioned it. The person was just getting close to Jack while Caroline was with Paul. \n\nIs the person responsible for not knowing Caroline's hidden motives? Since Caroline didn't communicate her feelings or intentions clearly, the person had no way of knowing. The person's actions were based on the situation presented to them, which was Caroline being with Paul. The person didn't know that Caroline was leading them on or using Paul as a ploy. \n\nAlso, Caroline's plan to go to Germany specifically to check on Jack's feelings seems a bit manipulative. She used the trip as a way to see if Jack still had feelings, which adds to the complexity. The person wasn't aware of this and ended up being in a position where they formed a connection with Jack. \n\nThe person didn't do anything to intentionally hurt Caroline. They acted based on the information given to them, which was that Caroline was interested in Paul. The person's actions were consensual with Jack, and there's no indication they were aware of Caroline's past feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the necessary information to know Caroline's true intentions. Caroline's lack of communication and her manipulative behavior led to the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
