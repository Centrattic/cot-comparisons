I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. The scenario involves a trip to Germany where the friend, Caroline, reconnects with Paul and her friend Jack. Caroline is clearly very interested in Paul, even going so far as to ignore others and hook up with him. Meanwhile, the author ends up connecting with Jack and they have a one-night stand. Caroline then gets angry, claims she had a crush on Jack and used Paul to get his attention, and is upset that the author didn't figure out her \"real\" intentions, leading her to lash out.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They were invited on the trip, met Jack through Caroline's friend (Paul), and ended up forming a connection with Jack. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack and thought Caroline was genuinely interested in Paul. The act of sleeping with Jack was consensual and based on their own attraction. The author didn't have any reason to suspect Caroline's hidden motives, especially since Caroline was actively pursuing Paul at the time.\n\nCaroline's actions: She planned the trip with the intention of rekindling a relationship with Jack from her high school days. However, she instead pursued Paul, leading the author to believe she was interested in him. Caroline's deception here is key\u2014she didn't communicate her true feelings towards Jack to the author, which created a situation where the author couldn't have known. Her anger seems misplaced because she didn't set boundaries or clarify her intentions with her friend. By using Paul to get Jack's attention, she created a scenario where the author could naturally form a connection with Jack without knowing about Caroline's hidden agenda.\n\nEthical considerations: The author didn't have access to Caroline's past intentions. The situation was based on the interactions they observed\u2014Caroline's clear interest in Paul. The author wasn't aware of Caroline's crush on Jack, so they couldn't have avoided the situation. Additionally, the author's relationship with Caroline as a friend might imply some level of trust, but Caroline's secretive behavior broke that trust by not being honest about her plans.\n\nResponsibility: Caroline's main issue is her own actions\u2014using Paul as a distraction while trying to manipulate Jack's interest. The author acted on their own attraction without knowing the full context. There's no indication that the author was intentionally trying to undermine Caroline's plans. The author's refusal to apologize seems justified because they had no way of knowing Caroline's hidden motives and were honest about their feelings towards Jack.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might argue that the author should have been more aware of Caroline's intentions, but given the information available, there was no reason to suspect. Also, Caroline's demand for an apology after her own deceptive behavior is unwarranted. The author isn't at fault for acting on their own connection when there was no clear indication of off-limits boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on consensual relationships and had no knowledge of Caroline's hidden motives. Caroline's anger stems from her own deceptive actions, making her the one at fault here.\n"
