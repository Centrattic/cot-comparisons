I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college friend, Caroline, who invited the author on a trip to Germany. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, hooks up with him, and the author ends up getting close to Jack, Caroline's high school crush. They sleep together, and Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack and thought the trip was to see if he still liked her. She's angry and wants an apology, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack. Caroline was the one actively pursuing Paul, and the author was left with Jack. The author didn't know Caroline's plan to use Paul to make Jack jealous. They slept with Jack without knowing he was her crush. The author's actions were based on the situation presented to them, not knowing Caroline's hidden agenda. \n\nCaroline's anger stems from the fact that she planned the trip to test Jack's feelings, used Paul as a ploy, and then the author interfered by being with Jack. But the author had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. It seems like Caroline manipulated the situation by setting up the trip and using the author as a way to get back to Jack. The author's main fault could be that they didn't notice Caroline's game, but since they didn't act on prior knowledge, maybe they aren't at fault.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more aware of the dynamics or not pursued a relationship with Jack if they suspected something. But the story says the author didn't know about the crush or Caroline's plan. The author's actions were consensual with Jack, who was available at the time. Caroline's actions created the situation where the author felt they could get close to Jack. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong because they had no prior knowledge of Caroline's true intentions. The blame might lie more with Caroline for using the trip as a manipulative plan. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
