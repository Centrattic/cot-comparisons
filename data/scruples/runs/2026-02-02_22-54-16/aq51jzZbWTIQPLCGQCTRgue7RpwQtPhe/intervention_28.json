I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline. During the trip, Caroline started flirting with Paul, another friend of Jack's. The author ended up spending time with Jack, and they ended up hooking up. Now, Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought she was using Paul to make Jack jealous. The author refuses to apologize, but Caroline is still angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They met Jack through Caroline, and Caroline was the one who was initially flirting with Paul. The author was ignored by Caroline during the trip and ended up getting closer to Jack. Since Caroline was the one who planned the trip to see if Jack still had feelings for her, maybe she didn't communicate her intentions to the author. The author had no way of knowing about Caroline's feelings towards Jack, so when they hooked up with Jack, it wasn't intentional on their part. \n\nBut wait, was the author aware of Caroline's history with Jack? The author knew that Caroline studied in Germany and reconnected with Jack, but didn't know about the crush. The author was spending time with Jack because Caroline was busy with Paul. So the author wasn't intentionally trying to interfere with Caroline's plans. Caroline's actions might have been misleading because she was focusing on Paul, making the author think there was no connection there. \n\nAlso, the author didn't know that Caroline's main goal was to test Jack's feelings. Caroline's reaction seems a bit hypocritical because she was the one who set up the trip and then tried to manipulate the situation by using Paul to get Jack's attention. The author was just following the social dynamics as presented. \n\nFrom a friendship standpoint, Caroline might have overstepped by using her friend for personal reasons without clear communication. The author's actions were based on the information available at the time. Since there was no indication that Caroline was interested in Jack during the trip, the author isn't in the wrong. The blame here might lie more with Caroline for not being upfront about her intentions and for her manipulative behavior towards both the author and Jack. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
