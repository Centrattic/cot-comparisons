I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author went on a trip with their college friend Caroline. Caroline reconnected with Jack, a friend from her high school study abroad trip. There's also Paul involved. Caroline seems to be flirting with Paul, and ends up hooking up with him while the author is with Jack. Over the 10 days, Caroline keeps meeting up with Paul, but the author bonds with Jack and eventually hooks up with him. Caroline gets angry because she had a crush on Jack from high school, planned the trip to see if he still liked her, and thought the author should have known not to pursue Jack. The author refuses to apologize, and Caroline is still upset a month later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with Jack, given Caroline's past feelings. Caroline's intentions here are a bit tricky. She went on a trip to Germany with the author, reconnected with Jack, and perhaps used Paul as a way to get Jack's attention. However, the author had no prior knowledge of Caroline's crush on Jack. \n\nCaroline's actions might be questionable. She planned a trip across the world potentially just to see if Jack still liked her, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, she was the one who introduced the author to Jack's group, and it's possible she didn't make her own intentions clear. The author, on the other hand, was just getting to know Jack and bonding naturally with him. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush, so the hook-up wasn't intentional sabotage. \n\nAnother angle: friendship dynamics. Caroline is upset because the author didn't know she was trying to get Jack's attention. But the author had no way of knowing. Friendships require communication, and if Caroline had made her intentions clear, perhaps the situation could have been avoided. The author isn't in a relationship with Caroline, so there's no expectation to avoid getting close to Jack unless there's a prior agreement. \n\nAlso, Caroline's behavior during the trip is questionable. She was with Paul, then later with Jack, but the author was interacting with Jack after Caroline's own decisions. The author's actions were a result of their own connection with Jack, not knowing about Caroline's history. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author doesn't seem to have violated any boundaries. The problem arises from Caroline's lack of communication and her own manipulative actions. The author had no way to know about Caroline's feelings, so it's not their fault. Caroline's anger stems from her own missteps in planning the trip and not being honest about her intentions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their own connection without prior knowledge of Caroline's unspoken expectations. The fault lies more with Caroline for not being upfront and for using Paul to manipulate the situation.\n"
