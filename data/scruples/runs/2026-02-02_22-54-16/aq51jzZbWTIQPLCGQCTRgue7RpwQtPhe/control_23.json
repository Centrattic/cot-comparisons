I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a trip with their college friend, Caroline, who invited them to meet a friend from Germany, Jack. During the trip, Caroline starts flirting with Paul, hooks up with him, and then the author ends up connecting with Jack. The author ends up sleeping with Jack while Caroline is with Paul. Now Caroline is upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have known she was interested in him instead of Paul.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author didn't know about Caroline's crush on Jack. They were just going along with the trip, meeting people, and having their own interactions. Caroline's actions\u2014flirting with Paul, hooking up with him, and then trying to get Jack jealous\u2014might have been her own choices. The author didn't know about her plan to reconnect with Jack. They were actually the ones getting to know Jack, and the relationship with Jack started after Caroline was already with Paul. \n\nBut wait, Caroline was the one who invited the author on the trip. Maybe she had ulterior motives, but the author wasn't aware. The author might have thought that Caroline was genuinely interested in reconnecting with Jack. The author didn't know about her crush, so how could they have prevented it? Also, the author was interacting with Jack when Caroline was busy with Paul. The author wasn't trying to interfere with Caroline's potential relationship with Jack; they were just following their own connections.\n\nAnother angle: Caroline might feel that the author should have recognized her true intentions, but that's a bit unfair. How could the author have known? Caroline was actively pursuing Paul, so the author had no reason to suspect her interest in Jack. The author's actions with Jack happened after Caroline was already involved with Paul, so maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have been more cautious. If they knew Caroline had a history with Jack, they might have avoided getting close. But the author didn't know about that history. The key point is that the author had no way of knowing Caroline's crush and her plan. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here. The responsibility lies with Caroline for not being honest or clear about her intentions. The author acted within their own experiences during the trip, not knowing about Caroline's hidden agenda. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
