I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: Caroline invited the author on a trip to Germany. They met Jack, a friend of Caroline's, and Caroline started flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack's. Caroline ended up with Paul, while the author spent time with Jack and eventually hooked up with him. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the author should have realized her intentions. Now she's angry and demanding an apology.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Caroline's perspective: she had a crush on Jack and brought the author along to reconnect with Jack, but she ended up with Paul, possibly to make Jack jealous. The author didn't know about her crush and ended up with Jack. \n\nFrom the author's side, they had no way of knowing Caroline's true intentions. They were just following along and formed a connection with Jack. The author might not be at fault since they didn't know about the crush. Caroline planned the trip for her own reasons, which might be a bit manipulative. \n\nBut Caroline might argue that as a friend, the author should have been more perceptive. However, it's not clear if Caroline communicated her intentions. If she didn't tell the author about her crush, then the author can't be blamed for not knowing. The author isn't in a relationship with Caroline, so they weren't cheating. \n\nAlso, Caroline's reaction seems harsh. She's holding the author accountable for something that wasn't their fault. The author is right to not apologize if they didn't have the knowledge. The fact that Caroline used the trip to pursue Jack might be her own issue. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their own connection without prior knowledge. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
