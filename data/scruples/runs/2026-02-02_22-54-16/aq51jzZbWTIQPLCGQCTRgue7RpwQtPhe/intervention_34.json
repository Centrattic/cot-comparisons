I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for sleeping with their college friend's high school crush. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a trip to Germany with their friend Caroline, who met her friend Jack from a summer program in high school. Caroline started flirting with Paul, a friend of Jack's, and ended up hooking up with him. While that was happening, the author got closer to Jack. Eventually, the author and Jack hooked up when Caroline and Paul were out. Caroline was upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought the trip was a chance to reconnect with him, using Paul to make Jack jealous. She's now angry at the author for sleeping with Jack and demands an apology.\n\nThe author refuses to apologize, thinking they had no way of knowing about Caroline's feelings for Jack. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, from a general perspective, Caroline's actions might be a problem here. She invited the author on the trip, then started a fling with Paul while the author connected with Jack. Caroline's intention was to use Paul to get Jack's attention, but she didn't communicate that to the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack, so they couldn't have known that getting close to Jack was problematic. \n\nCaroline's behavior seems manipulative. She set up the trip under her own agenda, which the author wasn't part of. The author was just along for the ride, and the connection with Jack happened naturally. Since the author didn't know about Caroline's crush, it's not their fault. Also, Caroline's reaction is harsh, and she's holding the author responsible for something she didn't make clear. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize makes sense because they were in the dark about Caroline's intentions. The problem lies more with Caroline's lack of transparency and her manipulative approach. The author isn't in the wrong here because they couldn't have known, and the situation was set up in a way that led to this outcome. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
