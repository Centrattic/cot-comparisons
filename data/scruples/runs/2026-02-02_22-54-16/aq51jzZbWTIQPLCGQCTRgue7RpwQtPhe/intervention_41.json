I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack\u2019s friends, Paul. She\u2019s so into Paul that she\u2019s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn\u2019t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI\u2019ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if \u201che still felt anything\u201d AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I\u2019d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she\u2019s still demanding I apologize for being a \u201cslutty bitch\u201d and \u201cruining the trip.\u201d I see no reason to, but she\u2019s being so insistent I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a college friend, Caroline, and the author going on a trip to Germany. Caroline reconnects with a friend, Jack, and introduces the author to Jack's friend Paul. Caroline starts flirting heavily with Paul, hooks up with him, and then for the rest of the trip, she's focused on Paul. Meanwhile, the author ends up spending time with Jack and eventually sleeps with him. When Caroline finds out, she's really upset because she had a crush on Jack from high school and thought she was trying to get him jealous by being with Paul. The author refuses to apologize, and now Caroline is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was invited on a trip by a friend, met Jack through Caroline, and then had a relationship with Jack. But Caroline was using Paul to get back at Jack, which she didn't disclose to the author. The author didn't know about Caroline's feelings for Jack when they met him. So, the key points are whether the author had a right to be with Jack if they didn't know about Caroline's history with him. Also, Caroline's actions\u2014using Paul to try to get Jack's attention\u2014seems manipulative. If the author didn't know about Caroline's crush, then they can't be blamed for acting on their feelings with Jack. On the other hand, maybe the author should have been more aware of their friend's intentions. But Caroline didn't communicate her feelings to the author, so it's not like she made it obvious. The author's actions were based on their own experiences during the trip. I think the main issue is that Caroline's actions were underhanded, and the author isn't at fault for not knowing about her secret crush. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
