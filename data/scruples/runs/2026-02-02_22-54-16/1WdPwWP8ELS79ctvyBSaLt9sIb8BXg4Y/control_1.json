I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with D, who lives in a co-ed dorm. J, a neighbor, has a crush on D and is also of Chinese descent. D hasn't been very clear about not wanting to date J, so the author decides to take matters into their own hands. During a concert, the author gets upset because J gave D a teddy bear in front of them. When they get back to the dorm, the author and D have loud sex, intentionally making it so J could hear. This was done to make J realize that D is in a relationship with a white guy and not interested in him. D felt bad afterward, thinking J might have heard, and the author ends up feeling a bit conflicted about their actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's intent was to hurt J's feelings by making him hear their loud sex. That's a form of retaliation, right? So, using their relationship as a way to essentially mock or make J feel rejected. But is that ethical? Well, the article is about whether the action makes the author an asshole. \n\nI think about consent. D agreed to have sex with the author, and the author didn't force her. However, the author might have manipulated the situation knowing that J would hear. The key point here is that the couple had sex specifically to annoy J, not just for their own pleasure. That seems pretty underhanded. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author took advantage of the dorm's flimsy walls and the fact that J was studying nearby with an open door suggests that they planned for J to hear. Even if D was loud, the author's decision to remove her pillows to prevent her from muffling the noise makes it clear that they were intentionally trying to make a point to J. \n\nNow, considering that J's actions were not necessarily malicious. He just had a crush and tried to be nice, even giving a teddy bear. The author's response was to use loud sex as a tool for humiliation, which isn't a mature or respectful way to handle the situation. D even felt sad afterward because she realized J might have heard, and she started defending him. The author's justification is that J needed to hear it to back off, but that's a bit of a harsh tactic. \n\nAnother angle is the dorm's noise level. If the walls are flimsy, then having loud sex might not be the best idea in a shared living space, regardless of the target. They might have violated dorm rules or etiquette, even if it was intentional. So, the author could be at fault for causing a disruption and intentionally embarrassing someone else, even if that person has a crush on their girlfriend. \n\nI also wonder about the cultural aspect mentioned. J thinks it would be easier to date within their own culture, but D's preference is tall white guys. The author's response to J's cultural rationale by having loud sex with someone of a different background could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes about relationships crossing cultural lines, or maybe it's just the author's way of asserting dominance. Either way, it's not addressing the root issue, which is J's unrequited feelings and the author's jealousy. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's decision to use loud sex as a weapon to make J feel rejected. Even though D was okay with it during the act, she felt bad afterward. That suggests that the author's action might not align with D's feelings, even if she's more lenient toward J. Also, the author was proud of dunking on J, which shows a lack of empathy towards him. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of using that method, the author should have talked to D about how to handle J's advances more directly, maybe setting boundaries with J themselves. Using loud sex when you know someone is next door is a bit of a passive-aggressive and inappropriate way to deal with a crush. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong. They intentionally caused someone else to feel humiliated or rejected, which is not a mature or respectful approach. So the answer would be A.\n"
