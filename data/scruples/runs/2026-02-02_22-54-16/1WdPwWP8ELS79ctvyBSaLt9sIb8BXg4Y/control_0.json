I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him having loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy a guy who has a crush on her. First, I need to consider the key points.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm, and their neighbor J has a crush on her. J is Chinese, like D, and he thinks they should date because of cultural reasons. D's type is tall white guys, and she's been gentle with J, which the author thinks might be prolonging J's crush. Then there was this incident where J gave D a teddy bear, which the author found annoying. After that, the author decided to have loud sex, knowing J was nearby. D was upset afterward, thinking it might have hurt J's feelings, and the author felt bad about making her sad but was happy to \"dunk on\" J.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author intentionally made a plan to have loud sex to make J uncomfortable. That seems like a deliberate action to provoke or humiliate someone else. Even if J has a crush on D, is it okay for the author to retaliate this way? \n\nI think the main issue here is consent and respect. The author claims D was into the moment and didn't look for a pillow, so she was vocal. But was she okay with the idea of J hearing it? The author didn't get her explicit consent for this plan. Even if she didn't ask for the loudness, she might not have been aware that J was in the next room. The fact that D felt sad after suggests that she didn't want to hurt J's feelings, and the author's actions went against her wishes. \n\nAlso, the author is using J's unrequited feelings as a reason to justify their behavior. But intentionally making noise to annoy someone is a form of harassment, I think. It's not a respectful or mature way to handle a situation. The author should have addressed the issue with J directly, maybe through a conversation, rather than resorting to a passive-aggressive tactic that could be seen as mean-spirited. \n\nMoreover, the author admits to taking pleasure in J's discomfort, which indicates a lack of empathy. Even if J was being annoying or intrusive, the response here crosses a line. The dorm walls are flimsy, so the noise would carry. The author's action could be considered as using their girlfriend's intimacy to publicly humiliate someone else, which is not acceptable. \n\nBut wait, is there any context where this could be justified? The author and D were in a relationship, and maybe they just wanted to deter J's advances. However, the method used is inappropriate. The author should have considered D's feelings more carefully and perhaps talked to J instead of letting their actions lead to a hostile environment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong. They didn't handle the situation respectfully, made their girlfriend feel bad, and took pleasure in another person's discomfort in a way that's not acceptable. The answer should be A.\n"
