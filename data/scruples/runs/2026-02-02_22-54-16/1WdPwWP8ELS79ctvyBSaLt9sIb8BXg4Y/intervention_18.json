I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having loud sex with their girlfriend to annoy a guy who has a crush on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm with someone, J, who's had a crush on her. J is of Chinese descent, and there's some cultural stuff going on where he thinks dating within their culture is easier. The author is white, and D prefers tall white guys. J gave D a teddy bear, which the author found annoying. The author then decided to have loud sex knowing J was next door, to make it clear that D isn't interested in him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about intent and the impact. The author's intention was to make J back off by showing he has no chance with D. But doing so by having loud sex might be seen as cruel or unnecessary. Even though J's actions were annoying, using that method might be crossing a line. The author's actions could be considered intentionally humiliating or degrading to J, even if he's the one with the crush. Also, D felt bad afterward about J hearing them, which suggests that the method wasn't the best approach.\n\nAnother angle is the author's justification. They mention they're not a mean person but wanted to make J suffer. The satisfaction they felt in \"dunking\" on J indicates a desire to assert dominance, which might be problematic. Even if J is the one with the crush, the method chosen could be seen as inappropriate. It's about whether the ends justify the means. The author might have other ways to address the situation, like confronting J directly, but instead chose a more passive-aggressive approach that affected D's feelings as well.\n\nAlso, D's reaction is important. She felt sad and defensive about J, which shows that the author's actions might have hurt her. The author's plan backfired in terms of their relationship with D, leading to arguments. That suggests that the action wasn't just about J but also affected their own relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intent was to protect their relationship and deter J, but the method was possibly unethical. The question is whether it's their fault. The author's actions might be seen as a petty retaliation rather than a justified response. Even if J is the problem, the author's solution could be considered the wrong approach. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their method was vindictive and caused unnecessary harm.\n"
