I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend, D, is in a co-ed dorm, and there's a neighbor, J, who has a crush on her. The author mentions that J is of Chinese descent, and D is of Chinese descent too. J's reasoning for wanting to date her is cultural, but D prefers tall white guys. The author feels that J's resentment towards white guys dating Asian women is unfounded, but maybe that's just his opinion.\n\nThen, there's the incident where J gives D a teddy bear in front of the author. The author was trying to be polite but felt J was dismissive. The author then decides to make J \"suffer\" by having loud sex with D when they know J is nearby. The walls are thin, so they expect he can hear it. Afterward, D feels bad, thinking J might be upset. The author, however, is glad they did it to make J realize he's not an option. J reacts with anger, but the author acts innocent when they meet later.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author intentionally used loud sex as a prank to make J back off. D felt guilty afterward, and the author enjoyed the situation, even if they later say they're sorry. The author's actions were calculated to embarrass or humiliate J, even if it's in a non-physical way. \n\nThe question is whether that makes the author the asshole. In many cases, pranks that invade someone's privacy or cause emotional distress, even if not physically harmful, can be considered wrong. The author's motivation was to hurt J's feelings to deter his crush, which could be seen as cruel. Also, the author didn't consider J's feelings beyond their own need to feel secure. D's guilt after the fact shows that the action had unintended emotional consequences. \n\nJ's reaction of hatred is a result of the author's actions. Even if the author justifies it as protecting their relationship, intentionally making someone uncomfortable through loud noises, especially in a shared living space, could be seen as a violation of basic respect. The author also used the situation to assert dominance, which might be considered petty or mean-spirited. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that J was being persistent and that the author was just standing up for their relationship. But the method chosen was to embarrass him, which crosses a line. The fact that the author felt \"thrilled\" to dunk on J shows a lack of empathy. In relationships, sometimes people act out of insecurity, but it's important to handle such situations with consideration for others' feelings.\n\nSo, taking all that into account, the author's actions were inappropriate and inconsiderate. They should have addressed the situation in a more respectful manner, maybe by confronting J directly or discussing with D how to handle his advances. Using loud sex as a prank is more about the author's need to feel in control rather than a constructive solution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
