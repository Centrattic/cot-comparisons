I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he had loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy another guy who has a crush on her. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the guy J has a crush on D, and he's been giving her teddy bears and stuff. He's Asian, and there's some cultural stuff going on where he thinks it would be easier to date someone within their culture. D, on the other hand, prefers tall white guys. The author is dating D and he felt J wasn't getting the message, so he decided to make J suffer by having loud sex that J could hear. The walls are flimsy, so J could hear them. The author admits he wanted to make J back off, but now he's questioning if he was wrong because he felt thrilled about it and J looked angry.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. Let me think about the ethics here. The author had an intention to annoy J, which is a bit passive-aggressive. He didn't confront J directly but instead used loud sex as a form of retaliation. That seems a bit underhanded. Also, using the girlfriend's loudness during sex as a weapon against another person could be seen as manipulating the situation for his own satisfaction. \n\nBut then again, J was being persistent and maybe a bit creepy by giving a teddy bear without introducing the author. D's roommate was out, so the walls are thin. The author might have felt J wasn't getting the hint. But is it acceptable to use loud sex as a method to deter someone? It could be considered a violation of J's privacy, even if it's a shared dorm. Also, D was upset after realizing what they did, which might indicate that the author went too far. \n\nThe author also admitted he felt a bit thrilled about it, which shows he took pleasure in J's discomfort. That's a red flag. Even if J was annoying, intentionally causing someone to feel rejected through such a public and intimate act might not be the best approach. There's also the aspect of consent and considering others' feelings. The author didn't think about how J might feel, which is a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of acting out, maybe the author should have talked to J directly or encouraged D to be clearer with him. Using loud sex as a tactic could be seen as immature and mean-spirited. It's possible that the author crossed a line by using his own relationship's intimacy as a tool to hurt someone else. \n\nSo, putting this all together, even though J's actions were annoying, the author's method of response was inappropriate. It's the wrong approach to handle the situation by invading someone's privacy and causing discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
