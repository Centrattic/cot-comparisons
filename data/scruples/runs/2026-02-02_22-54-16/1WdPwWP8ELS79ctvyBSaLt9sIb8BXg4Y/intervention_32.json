I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by going through the details again.\n\nThe author is in a three-month relationship with his girlfriend, D. There's a neighbor, J, who has a crush on D. J is of Chinese descent, same as D. The author is Caucasian. J believes that dating within their culture would be easier, but D is into tall white guys. The author found out about J's crush and felt that D wasn't being forceful enough in turning him down. Then, there's the incident where J gives D a teddy bear, which really annoyed the author. The author decided to have loud sex with D to make J suffer a bit, as he thought it would make J back off. However, D felt bad about it later, and the author ended up feeling conflicted about his actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to make J back off by being loud during sex. But the method involved using D's personal time to do so, which might not have considered her comfort. D later felt sad that J might be hurt, and she got upset with the author for being mean. That's a red flag. Even if the author thought it was a way to handle the situation, using loud sex as a tool to humiliate or make J suffer might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author's response to D's concern\u2014suggesting that J needed to hear it to understand he's not an option\u2014could be seen as dismissive of D's feelings. The fact that D was upset after and the author had to apologize indicates that this approach was not appropriate. The author's satisfaction in \"dunking\" on J shows a desire to humiliate, which is mean-spirited regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother angle: the author used a situation that should be intimate and personal (sex with his girlfriend) as a tool for personal revenge or to assert dominance. That's not healthy. Relationships should be about mutual respect and support, not using each other or the relationship to deal with external issues. The author's actions might have made D feel used in some way, even if she was okay with it at the time.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't communicate properly with D about his feelings towards J. Instead of addressing it directly or finding a respectful way to handle J's crush, he resorted to a manipulative tactic. This could lead to more issues in their relationship if not handled better.\n\nBut wait, the author claims he's not a mean person and tried to be polite. However, the action itself was about making someone suffer, which is mean, regardless of the person's usual character. The fact that the author found it thrilling to \"dunk on\" J shows a lack of empathy towards J's feelings, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, considering that J might have been trying to be friendly or just expressing his feelings, even if misguided, the author's response was overly harsh. There's no evidence that J was harassing or doing anything malicious beyond having a crush. The author's reaction was disproportionate.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to protect his relationship, the method he used was inappropriate and unkind. It affected D's feelings and might have caused unnecessary harm to J. The correct approach would have been to address the situation with D and possibly talk to J respectfully, not to use loud sex as a weapon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
