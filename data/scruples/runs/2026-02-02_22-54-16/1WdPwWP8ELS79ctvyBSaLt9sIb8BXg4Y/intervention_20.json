I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author (who calls himself \"AITA\") is in the wrong for having loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy someone who has a crush on her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a three-month relationship with D, who's Chinese. Their neighbor J, also Chinese, has a crush on D. The author knew about J before dating D. J gives D a teddy bear in front of the author, which upsets him. The author then plans to have loud sex to make J suffer, which happens when J is in his room next door. D feels bad about it, but the author thinks it's justified to make J realize he's not a romantic option.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks he's not, but others might have different views. Let me break down the key points.\n\n1. **Intent**: The author's intent was to hurt J's feelings by making him hear loud sex, which is meant to show that D is in a relationship and not interested. This is a form of retaliation for J's actions (the teddy bear), but is this justified?\n\n2. **Respect and Boundaries**: Even if J is a creep, the author's method of responding might be considered crossing a line. Deliberately making noise to humiliate someone could be seen as mean-spirited. Also, the author had the opportunity to stay over because D's roommate was out, which he used for this plan. \n\n3. **Impact on D**: D felt bad afterward, even though she's in a relationship. She was worried about J's feelings, and the author ended up making her upset. This could indicate that the action had unintended negative consequences on their relationship. \n\n4. **Proportionality**: Giving a teddy bear isn't a huge offense, so responding with loud sex might be disproportionate. However, the author might feel that J's persistent crush, despite D's clear signals, warrants a stronger reaction.\n\n5. **Cultural Considerations**: The user mentioned cultural aspects where J thinks it's easier to date within their culture. The author is white, and D prefers tall white guys. This might add to the underlying tension, but it's not clear if that affects the morality here.\n\n6. **General Ethics**: Is it okay to publicly humiliate someone for their unrequited feelings? Some might say no, as it's cruel. Others might argue it's a justified way to assert boundaries, especially if J is being annoying.\n\n7. **Legal Aspects**: Unless the noise was illegal (which it probably wasn't in a dorm), there's no legal wrong, but social ethics are the focus here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was driven by a desire to protect his relationship and assert dominance. But using loud sex as a weapon could be seen as manipulative and mean. The fact that D felt bad and J's reaction was hostile might mean the author overstepped. Even though the user thinks he's not wrong, the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong because of the targeted intent to hurt someone's feelings.\n"
