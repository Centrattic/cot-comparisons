I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by having loud sex with their girlfriend to annoy a guy who has a crush on her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend, D, is being pursued by J, who's of Chinese descent and has a crush on her. D is into tall white guys, and J's advances have been ongoing. The author, feeling that J isn't getting the message, decides to have loud sex so J can hear, to make it clear that D is taken and not interested.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intent was to humiliate or deter J. Using loud sex as a tactic. But is that acceptable? Let's consider the ethics. \n\nIntent matters. The author wanted to \"make J suffer,\" even if not severely. Deliberately using loud noises to embarrass or discourage J. That seems manipulative and possibly cruel. Even if J was annoying, the response was to invade his emotional space. \n\nThen there's the girlfriend's reaction. She felt sad for J after realizing he might have heard them. The author dismissed her concern, suggesting J needed to hear it. But D is more empathetic and perhaps the author overstepped by not respecting her feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's own admission that they felt \"thrilled to completely dunk on this dude\" and the fear that they have a \"primal part\" wanting to be \"king\" indicates a problematic mindset. It's about asserting dominance rather than a healthy resolution to a conflict.\n\nIn terms of boundaries and consent, the author and D were in a relationship and had consensual sex. But the aspect of using that to target J is where the issue lies. It's about how they handled the situation with J, not the act of having sex itself.\n\nIs it the author's wrong? They acted out of spite, possibly causing emotional harm. Even if J had a crush, the method to deal with it was inappropriate. The right approach would be open communication, maybe involving D in addressing J's behavior, or talking to J directly if necessary. Instead, the author chose a vindictive method that could be considered bullying.\n\nAlso, the cultural aspect where J mentions dating within their culture is a red flag. The author might be overreacting to J's comments, but that doesn't justify their actions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were intended to humiliate someone else, which is wrong. They didn't handle the situation maturely. So the answer is A.\n"
