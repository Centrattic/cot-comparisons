I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having loud sex to annoy a guy who has a crush on his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend, D, is in a dorm with someone named J who has a crush on her. J is of Chinese descent, and D is also Chinese. The author is white. J thinks it's easier for them to date within their culture, but D likes tall white guys. The author feels that J's crush is prolonged because D is too gentle in rejecting him.\n\nIn the concert incident, J gives D a teddy bear, which the author finds annoying. The author then plans to have loud sex knowing J is in the adjacent room, so J can hear them. The goal is to make J \"suffer\" and back off. The girlfriend feels bad afterward, thinking it's harsh on J, but the author defends it as necessary.\n\nSo, the main points here are about intent, respect, and the consequences of the action. The author's intent was to humiliate J or make him aware that D isn't interested. But is it wrong to do that?\n\nFirst, consider the respect aspect. Deliberately making noise that a neighbor can hear is a breach of privacy and respect. Even if the walls are thin, intentionally being loud to annoy someone crosses a line. The author used the fact that D can be loud, which she's normally careful about, to ensure J hears them. That's calculated, not accidental.\n\nThen, the reaction: the girlfriend is upset because she thinks J is a kind person and it's painful for him to hear. The author, however, is glad to \"dunk on\" J, showing a desire to assert dominance. This could be seen as petty or bullying. The author's enjoyment in J's discomfort is problematic because it's about making J feel rejected in a harsh way, which isn't a healthy way to handle a situation.\n\nAlso, the cultural angle: J's belief that dating within his culture would be easier. However, attraction is personal, and while that's his rationale, it doesn't justify his unrequited feelings. The author's action isn't addressing the root of J's feelings but punishing him for them.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a relationship and has the right to be intimate, but doing so in a way that's intended to annoy a neighbor is not appropriate. It's about respect for others' living spaces. Even if the walls are thin, intentionally being loud to make a point is a misuse of that situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction shows that the author's action had unintended emotional consequences. The author dismisses her concern, thinking J \"deserved\" it, which shows a lack of empathy towards both J and his potential feelings. The author's satisfaction in J's hatred indicates a desire for revenge rather than resolving the situation respectfully.\n\nIn summary, the author's action was intentional to annoy and embarrass J, which is disrespectful. It's not about communication or addressing the issue with J but using a private act as a weapon. That's why the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
