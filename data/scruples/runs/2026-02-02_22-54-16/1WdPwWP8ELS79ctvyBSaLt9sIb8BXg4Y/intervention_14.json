I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy someone who has a crush on her. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend, D, lives in a co-ed dorm. A neighbor, J, has a crush on her. The author knows about J and has had some interactions, including J giving D a teddy bear in front of him. The author then plans to have loud sex with D to make J uncomfortable, knowing the walls are thin. D gets upset afterward because she feels bad for J, but the author defends his actions as a way to make J realize D isn't interested.\n\nNow, I need to consider ethics and social norms. The author's intention was to assert his relationship and deter J's advances. But is it okay to use someone's sexual activity as a tool to manipulate another person? There are a few angles here.\n\nFirst, consent: The author and D were in a consensual relationship. They had sex that night, which was their choice. The loudness was intentional, but D might not have been fully aware of the potential impact until after. The author says they started having sex on the second date, so maybe they've had loud sex before, but this time was specifically to annoy J.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting J's feelings. The author knew J was nearby and could hear them. Even if J was being creepy, is it right to use loud sex as a form of retaliation? It's a form of public shaming or humiliation, which is generally frowned upon. Also, D was upset about it, which might indicate that the author crossed a line, even if he thought it was justified.\n\nAnother point is the cultural aspect. The user mentioned that J is of Chinese descent and believes dating within the same culture is better. D is Asian but prefers tall white men. The author might be reacting to J's cultural bias, which adds another layer. However, the core issue here is about the method used to address it.\n\nThe author's actions led to J feeling hatred towards him, which the author acknowledges. While J might have been persistent and a bit obnoxious, the author's response was personal and could be seen as cruel. It's a form of revenge that's invasive and could be considered bullying. The author's satisfaction in \"dunking\" on J suggests a desire for dominance, which might be ethically questionable.\n\nAdditionally, D's reaction is important. She felt bad for J and was upset with the author, indicating that the action might have been unkind. Even if the author thought it was justified, it's possible that he didn't consider the emotional impact on both J and D. The fact that D was distressed after shows that the action had unintended negative consequences.\n\nIn terms of the relationship dynamic, the author made the decision without fully considering D's feelings beyond her initial reaction. While D initially went along, her subsequent sadness indicates she didn't agree with the approach. The author should have discussed the plan more thoroughly with her and respected her feelings, especially since she felt empathy for J.\n\nOverall, while J's behavior was problematic, the author's method of dealing with it was aggressive and potentially harmful. There are other ways to address J's behavior, like confronting him directly or having D be more firm. Using loud sex as a weapon crosses into manipulative and potentially cruel territory, even if the intention was to protect the relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not considering the broader consequences and for using a tactic that humiliated someone else.\n"
