I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having loud sex with his girlfriend to annoy a guy who has a crush on her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, let's call him A, and his girlfriend D have been together three months. There's another guy, J, who has a crush on D. J is Chinese, D is Chinese-American, and J has a cultural bias about dating within his culture. A is white, which is part of D's type. J gave D a teddy bear in front of A, which probably made A feel threatened or annoyed. A then had loud sex with D knowing J was in the next room, to make J feel like D isn't interested. \n\nNow, the question is whether A is the asshole here. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nSo, starting with the facts: A and D are in a relationship. A's actions were intentional to make J uncomfortable. The main ethical points here are about consent and respect. D consented to the sex, but A's motivation was to annoy J. But J's feelings aren't a concern here, right? Because it's not A's job to consider J's feelings if J is being a creep. However, there's the issue of whether A used D for that purpose. Did A pressure D into being loud for that reason? The text says D was caught up in the moment and didn't have a pillow, so she was loud. But D felt bad later, thinking it might hurt J. A defended it as J needing to hear it, but D was upset with A. \n\nSo, the key points are: \n1. Did A overstep by using their relationship to antagonize J? \n2. Was it respectful to D's feelings? \n3. Is it acceptable to use loud sex as a weapon against someone else?\n\nOn one hand, J is a stalkerish figure, giving gifts without consent and being creepy. A might feel justified in making J back off. On the other hand, using loud sex as a method is a bit of a manipulation of the situation. Also, D was uncomfortable after, which suggests that maybe A didn't consider her feelings enough. Even though D consented to the sex, the intention to annoy J might have crossed a line. \n\nAnother angle: Is it A's responsibility to handle J's feelings? If J is being creepy, A might feel justified in putting a stop to it. However, the method chosen could be seen as cruel or unnecessary. Also, J's cultural comment about dating within his culture is problematic, but that's his issue. \n\nEthically, the line is between self-defense and harassment. A is protecting his relationship, but the method might be excessive. Also, D's reaction indicates that she wasn't fully on board with the plan, which means A might have acted without her full consent regarding the purpose. \n\nIn conclusion, while J's behavior was inappropriate, A's response of intentionally making noise to annoy him might be crossing into harassment. It's possible that A is not entirely wrong, but the method used is questionable. However, given that it was a private act between A and D (assuming they were in their own room), maybe it's not A's fault. But since it was done with the intent to harm another person's feelings, that could make A the asshole. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A being in the wrong because intentionally using loud sex to antagonize someone else is a form of harassment, even if they're a creep. Also, D's discomfort after suggests that it wasn't the right approach. So answer A (yes, wrong). But I'm a bit torn because J was being creepy. Hmm.\n"
