She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. So the situation is: he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, told his wife about it, and she was initially okay. But over time, especially as they had their own daughter, she started teasing him and making jokes. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked for another donation, and he did it secretly, resulting in a second child. Now he's keeping this second child a secret from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Initial Disclosure**: He told his wife about the first child. That's a good start. But she didn't take it well, leading him to hide the second one. So he's not being deceptive from the start, but he withheld info after her negative reaction.\n\n2. **Secret Donation**: The second donation happened while his wife was pregnant. He went under the guise of visiting a friend. That's a problem because he didn't consult her at all. Even if she was difficult about the first, he should have considered transparency here. Maybe he thought she'd react worse, but lying by omission is an issue.\n\n3. **Marital Trust and Honesty**: In a marriage, honesty is usually expected, especially regarding significant matters like having another child. Even if the first child was a surprise, the second is a continuation. Withholding such info could erode trust. Also, the wife's jokes and teasing are a way of her handling stress or insecurity, but the author's response (hiding the second child) might not be the healthiest approach either.\n\n4. **Potential Consequences**: If the wife finds out later, it could cause more harm. The author's reasoning is that she's unpleasant about it, but keeping secrets can lead to bigger issues. The author's fear of her reactions is valid, but so is the need for mutual trust in a marriage.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Depending on where they live, there might be laws about parenthood rights for sperm donors. If the author is a legal parent, that could complicate things. But the question here is about moral wrong, not legal. Ethically, he has a duty to be honest with his spouse about such a major life decision.\n\n6. **Communication Issues**: The wife's teasing and jokes suggest unresolved feelings about the first child. The author should address these communication problems instead of hiding the second child. Maybe they need counseling or a serious talk about his actions and her feelings.\n\nPutting it together: The author made a choice to keep a significant secret that affects both their lives. While his wife's behavior is problematic, the act of not disclosing the second child is a breach of trust. He's in a tough spot, but withholding such information is generally considered dishonest and harmful. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child.\n"
