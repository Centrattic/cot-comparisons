She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they met. She was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it, even making jokes related to their daughter and Game of Thrones. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked him to donate again, which he did, resulting in a second child. Now, the author hasn't told his wife about the second child because of her previous reactions.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author was honest about the first donation but kept the second one secret. 2) His wife's reactions were making him uncomfortable. 3) The second donation happened while his wife was pregnant, which might add to the complexity because their own child was born around the same time.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is usually valued. However, the author might have had a legitimate reason to withhold the information if his wife's teasing and jokes were emotionally harmful. But then again, withholding such a significant detail\u2014especially regarding another child\u2014could be seen as dishonesty, which might damage trust if discovered later.\n\nThe wife's behavior is also questionable. Teasing and using the situation as a weapon in arguments is not constructive. However, the author's decision not to disclose the second donation could be seen as a way to protect himself from further hurt, but it also means he's not being fully transparent with his wife. The second child is a part of his past that might have implications (like potential relationships with their daughter, as the wife joked about), which the author needs to consider.\n\nEthically, the author might be in the wrong for not being truthful about the second donation. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, keeping such a secret can lead to bigger issues down the line. However, the context of her behavior complicates things. It's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from ongoing emotional harm.\n\nIn many cases, transparency is expected in a marriage. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because he disclosed the first time, and the second time was perhaps done in a different context. But withholding the second time could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the wife finds out later. So, the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the lack of full disclosure, despite understandable reasons.\n"
