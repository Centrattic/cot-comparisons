She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that the author had already told their wife about the first child, but the wife started teasing and making jokes about it. Now the author didn't disclose the second child because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a choice to donate sperm when they were younger, which isn't illegal or unethical by itself. They told the wife about the first child, but she reacted negatively over time. The wife's teasing and bringing it up during arguments is causing the author discomfort. The author then decided to keep the second child a secret because of the wife's reaction to the first.\n\nNow, is it wrong to withhold this information? Well, in a marriage, transparency is important. However, the wife's behavior might have contributed to the author's decision. If the wife was using the information as a weapon or teasing constantly, the author might feel they're protecting themselves from further conflict. But then again, withholding such significant information about another child could have its own consequences. \n\nThe author's argument is that the wife's reaction was so negative that they felt justified in not telling her again. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. I need to evaluate if the author's actions are ethically wrong. \n\nMarital trust is crucial. Not telling the wife about a second child could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's teasing is hurtful, the second child is a new element. The fact that the author went through with the second donation under the guise of visiting a friend might be an issue. Also, if the wife finds out later, it could lead to more conflict. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to avoid conflict and discomfort. The wife's behavior was not a healthy response, so maybe the author's decision to not disclose is a self-protective measure. But in terms of right or wrong, withholding such information might be seen as wrong because it's a significant part of the author's life that could affect the marriage. \n\nBut considering that the wife was already made aware of the first situation and reacted poorly, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a complex situation where both parties have contributed to the tension. The author might have a valid reason to not want to endure more teasing, but withholding the second child could be seen as wrong. \n\nIn ethical terms, honesty is important in a relationship. However, the context matters. If the wife's teasing is a form of manipulation or emotional abuse, the author might have a valid reason to protect themselves. Still, not disclosing a second child is a big secret. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author had a history of negative reactions and was trying to prevent further conflict. But some might argue that the author should have been honest regardless. The line between protecting oneself and being dishonest is thin here. Given the wife's behavior, the author's decision could be seen as a way to maintain their well-being, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
