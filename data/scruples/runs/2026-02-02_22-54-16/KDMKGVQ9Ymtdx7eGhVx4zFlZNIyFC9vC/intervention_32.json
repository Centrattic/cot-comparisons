She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves him being a sperm donor twice and not telling his wife about the second child after she was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the key points. The author told his wife about the first child, but she became uncomfortable and made jokes. Then he kept the second child a secret. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation.\n\nMarital trust and honesty are big factors here. Generally, major life decisions like having children should be discussed between spouses. However, the context is important. The author didn't have a relationship with the woman, it was strictly a donation. He already told her about the first child, but she reacted negatively. Now, he's hiding the second to avoid further conflict.\n\nIs withholding the second child's existence a breach of trust? On one hand, the wife might feel betrayed for not knowing. On the other, the author might feel that the wife's reactions are hurtful and he's protecting himself from emotional stress. The fact that the second donation was made after the wife was pregnant complicates things. Did he consider her feelings even more in that case?\n\nAlso, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and using the topic during fights\u2014might be a way for her to express unresolved feelings about the first child. The author might be choosing silence to avoid confrontation, but this could backfire if she finds out later, thinking he was hiding something important.\n\nLegally and ethically, in some places, a spouse might have rights to know about other children from a partner, especially if there's a possibility of financial responsibility or if it affects the family dynamics. But since the donations were done anonymously and the author isn't involved in raising the children, that might mitigate some responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the core issue is about honesty in the marriage. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, keeping a secret about another child might be seen as dishonest. The author might justify it as protecting himself, but in a marriage, transparency is often valued. The decision not to disclose could lead to greater issues down the line if the secret is discovered, potentially causing more damage than the ongoing teasing he's trying to avoid.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest about the second child, even if the wife's behavior is part of the problem. Honesty is a fundamental part of a trusting relationship, and the consequences of keeping this secret could be more severe than the current discomfort he's experiencing.\n"
