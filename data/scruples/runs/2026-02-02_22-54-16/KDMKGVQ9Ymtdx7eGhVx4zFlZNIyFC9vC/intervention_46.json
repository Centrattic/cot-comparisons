She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation when she already knew about the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding but later became teasing and made jokes. Now, there's a second child from the same donation, and he hasn't told his wife. He's worried about her reaction and the teasing.\n\nSo, the main question is about honesty in a relationship. The author argues that he didn't want to add more stress because his wife is already making fun of the first situation. But in a marriage, especially regarding such a significant matter as having another child, isn't full disclosure important? Even if the wife is being unkind, the author hasn't been completely honest. \n\nHe used a lie of omission by not mentioning the second child. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the author might still have an obligation to be truthful. Lies can erode trust, and this could come out later, causing bigger issues. Also, the second child is part of the author's genetic lineage, which could have implications for the family dynamics, especially with their own daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is clearly toxic and hurtful. She's using this as a weapon in arguments, which is unfair. The author might feel he's protecting the family from further conflict by not disclosing. But is that a valid reason to withhold such information?\n\nMarital trust is crucial. If the author isn't honest about such a big secret, even if it's to avoid conflict, he might be harming the relationship in the long run. The wife's behavior is bad, but the author's decision to hide the second child could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, while the wife is clearly at fault for her teasing and using the situation as a weapon, the author's decision to not disclose the second child might be in the wrong. The right thing might have been to address the wife's behavior first, perhaps through communication or counseling, rather than withholding information.\n"
