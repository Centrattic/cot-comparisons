She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author became a sperm donor twice, first when he was 20, and then again when his wife was pregnant. He told his wife about the first child but not the second, because she reacted badly to the first. Now he's hiding the second child. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Honesty in a marriage is usually considered important. The author withheld information about a second child, which could be significant. The wife already knew about the first, but the author didn't mention the second. That could affect their relationship, especially if the wife finds out later through other means. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wife made jokes and teased him about the first child, which made him uncomfortable. He's worried that if he tells her about the second, she'll react even more negatively, maybe use it in arguments, or make more jokes. But is keeping it a secret the right choice?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, transparency is usually key. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, hiding the information could lead to mistrust if discovered later. The author might be protecting himself from discomfort, but that could harm the relationship in the long run. \n\nThe wife's teasing might be inappropriate, but that doesn't mean the author is justified in hiding the second child. Perhaps the author should address the wife's teasing first, maybe have a serious conversation about it, rather than keeping secrets. However, the author is in a tough spot because the wife's behavior is making him uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, legally, there might be considerations. In some places, being a sperm donor to someone you know could result in legal parenthood, which could have implications for the author if the second child is involved. But the user is asking about moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nEthically, the author is keeping a secret that could have significant consequences. If the wife were to find out later, she might feel betrayed, leading to bigger issues. Even if the wife is acting immaturely, honesty is generally expected in a marriage. The author's decision to not disclose the second child could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over the relationship's trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a stressful situation where his partner's constant teasing is making him uncomfortable. The wife's behavior might be the root issue here. The author could be acting out of self-preservation, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. There's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from emotional harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's decision to withhold information about the second child is ethically questionable. The expectation of honesty in a marriage suggests that he is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child, even if the wife's reaction is unkind.\n"
