She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, given that his wife was already upset about the first one. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife is teasing him and making jokes about it, which is making him uncomfortable. The author is worried that if he tells her about the second child, it might cause more problems. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, in relationships, honesty is usually important. The author didn't disclose the second child, which could be seen as a secrecy issue. However, the wife's reaction to the first child was negative and teasing, which might explain his hesitation. But withholding information about a second child could lead to betrayal or trust issues, especially if the wife finds out later. \n\nAnother angle is that the author was helping a friend with her desire to have siblings for her kids. But the wife might feel that he didn't consider her feelings in deciding to have a second child. Also, the author's decision to not inform his wife about the second donation could be seen as dishonest, especially if there's a possibility the wife could find out in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife was already using the first child as a way to tease or fight with him, maybe the author is trying to protect the relationship by not adding fuel to the fire. But is that a valid reason to lie? It might not be. Trust is a big part of marriage, and keeping such a secret could harm the relationship more in the long run.\n\nI think the main issue here is whether the author's secrecy is justified given the wife's behavior. While her teasing is problematic, the author's decision to withhold information about another child might not be the right approach. The right thing would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's uncomfortable, to maintain trust. So the author is in the wrong for keeping the second child a secret.\n"
