She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they met, and she was initially understanding. However, over time, especially after they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. The jokes and questions about the process made him uncomfortable. Then, the same woman asked him to donate again, and he did so secretly, resulting in a second child. He hasn't told his wife about this second child.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing this second donation. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that since his wife already reacted negatively to the first one, telling her about the second would only make things worse. He's trying to avoid conflict and discomfort. But from his wife's side, she might feel that she has a right to know about this second child, especially since they have their own daughter and the author's actions could have implications on their family dynamics.\n\nMarital trust is a big factor here. Withholding information about a second child, even if it's through sperm donation, might be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that he already lied about visiting the woman (posing as an old friend) adds another layer of deception. Even if the wife's reactions are unkind, the author might be avoiding the truth, which could lead to bigger issues later if discovered.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and making jokes\u2014might justify the author's hesitation. But in a relationship, honesty is usually expected, even if the topic is uncomfortable. The author's decision to hide the second child could be seen as a deliberate choice to keep information from his spouse, which is generally considered a no-no in marriages.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is using this information as a weapon in arguments, it's possible the author is acting out of self-preservation. But the key issue is transparency. Without full disclosure, there's a lack of honesty, which can erode trust over time. \n\nSo, while the author's reasons are understandable, the fact remains that he hasn't been truthful about a significant aspect of his life that could affect their family. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child, even if it's through sperm donation. The right thing would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's difficult.\n"
