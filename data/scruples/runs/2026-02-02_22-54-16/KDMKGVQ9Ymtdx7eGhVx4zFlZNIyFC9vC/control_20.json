She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after a year. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it. Now, the author kept the second child a secret because of her reactions. \n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in marriage and the wife's reaction. On one hand, the author didn't disclose a significant part of his past that could affect their family. On the other hand, the wife's behavior was inappropriate, making him uncomfortable with sharing more.\n\nBut wait, marriage typically requires transparency about major life decisions. The author had a second child through donation, which is a big deal. Even if the wife was teasing, hiding this could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might be justifying it because of her reaction, but that doesn't make it right. Also, the second child's existence could have implications for their family dynamics, like legal responsibilities or future relationships.\n\nHowever, the wife's response to the first child was problematic. She turned it into a joke and used it in fights. The author might feel that telling her would only escalate the situation. But withholding such information could lead to bigger issues if discovered later. The author's decision not to tell might be a way to protect himself from her teasing, but it's still a lie by omission.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author is withholding information that a spouse has a right to know. Even if the wife's reaction is immature, the author's responsibility is to be honest. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But there's nuance because the wife's behavior complicates things. Still, the standard in relationships is honesty, so the author's secrecy despite the wife's behavior could be considered wrong.\n"
