She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that he was a sperm donor once before, told his wife, and she was okay at first but later started teasing him about it. Now, the same woman asked for a second donation, and he did it without telling his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is honesty in a marriage. The author kept a secret about a significant life event related to his reproductive contributions. He had already disclosed the first donation, but the second one is another child. His wife might have different expectations now, especially since they have their own child. The author's reasoning is that he didn't want to deal with her teasing and jokes, which is understandable, but withholding such information could be seen as deceptive.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention wasn't malicious; he wanted to avoid conflict. On the other, the second donation is a major thing that affects the family dynamics. Marital trust is built on transparency, even about uncomfortable topics. Not disclosing this could lead to bigger issues down the line, especially if the second child becomes a part of their lives or if his wife finds out another way.\n\nAlso, the wife's reactions might be influenced by her own insecurities or stress, but that doesn't justify the author hiding the information. The key here is whether the author's actions violated the trust in the marriage. Secrets about creating another child, even if not directly related to the marital relationship, can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might feel it's not a big deal, but the act of concealing it after the first instance suggests he knows how sensitive the issue is.\n\nSo, considering the importance of honesty in a marriage and the potential consequences of keeping such a secret, the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second donation. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's another angle. If the author never had any relationship with the woman beyond the donation, and the second child is not part of their life, maybe it's not his to disclose? But once you've created a child through donation, even if you're not involved, it's part of your genetic legacy. The wife might have feelings about it, especially if there's a possibility of future interactions. So, the lack of disclosure is still a problem because it's a significant fact about his life and reproductive choices that affects the marriage. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
