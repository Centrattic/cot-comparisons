She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The story says he told his wife about the first child, but she's been teasing him about it. Now, there's a second child from the same woman, and he's considering not telling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was honest about the first child but the wife's reaction became problematic. He's choosing not to disclose the second child to avoid further issues. The question is about whether this non-disclosure makes him wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, transparency is usually important in relationships. However, there are exceptions when the information could cause significant harm or if the person being asked has already overreacted. The wife's behavior here seems to cross into teasing and using it as a weapon during fights, which is not healthy. The author might feel that not sharing the second child is a way to protect himself from ongoing distress.\n\nBut some might argue that withholding information, even if the spouse is acting out, can erode trust. However, the author did disclose the first instance, so maybe the second is seen as an extension of that. The line is blurry here. The intention behind the author's decision is crucial. If he's protecting himself from a toxic reaction, maybe it's understandable. But if the second child is a significant part of his life or affects their family, there's an argument for full disclosure.\n\nAlso, the wife's jokes about incest and bringing it up during fights indicate she's using the information in a harmful way. In such a case, the author's choice to not share more might be a self-defense mechanism. The key is whether the second child's existence impacts their current family dynamics. If the woman isn't part of their lives and there's no risk of the children meeting, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the second child becomes a part of their life, that might change things.\n\nSo, considering the wife's negative reaction and the author's intent to avoid harm, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. But there's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from toxicity. Since the wife is the one creating a hostile environment, the author's decision to withhold might be justifiable.\n"
