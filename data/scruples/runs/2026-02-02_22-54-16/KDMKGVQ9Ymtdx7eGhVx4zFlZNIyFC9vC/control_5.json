She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a son through sperm donation when he was 20. He told his wife about this when they first met, and she was initially understanding. However, over time, especially after they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. The woman then asked him to donate again for a second child, which he did, and now he's keeping that secret.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether not disclosing the second donation is wrong. From a relationship perspective, honesty is usually key. The wife already found the first donation uncomfortable, so the husband might be trying to avoid conflict. But by not telling her about the second child, he's hiding something significant. Even if the first situation was handled poorly, the second instance is a new secret that could affect their relationship. The wife has a right to know about all potential half-siblings for their daughter, especially if there are future implications like family medical history or legal matters.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife is using the first incident to tease and provoke him might be her issue, but that doesn't justify not being honest about the second. The husband's decision to withhold information could erode trust, which is more harmful in the long run. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, the husband's secrecy could lead to bigger problems if the truth comes out later in a different context. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is in the wrong for not being truthful about the second donation, regardless of his wife's behavior. The right approach would be to have an open and honest conversation, even if it's uncomfortable, to maintain trust in the relationship.\n"
