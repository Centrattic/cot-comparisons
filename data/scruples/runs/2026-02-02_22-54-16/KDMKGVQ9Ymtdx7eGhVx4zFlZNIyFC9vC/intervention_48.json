She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation after she reacted negatively to the first one. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and told his wife about it after they got together. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes, including references to Game of Thrones and hypothetical incest scenarios. The author then donated again secretly, resulting in a second child, and chose not to inform his wife again because of her past reactions.\n\nSo, the question is about whether keeping this secret is wrong. From a relationship standpoint, honesty is usually important. But the wife's behavior complicates things. If she's been mocking him and using it as a weapon in arguments, maybe the author felt justified in not sharing more. However, not telling her about a second child is a significant omission. It could affect their family dynamics, especially if the wife ever finds out through other means. \n\nLegally, in some places, there are laws about notifying the other spouse about children from previous relationships, but this is a sperm donation, not a previous marriage. So maybe not legally binding, but ethically? The author might be prioritizing his mental health and the relationship's stability by not adding more stress. But withholding such information could lead to trust issues later if discovered. \n\nThe wife's teasing and jokes might indicate deeper issues in the relationship that need addressing. Perhaps the author should consider couples counseling to handle the tension instead of keeping secrets. However, if the wife is intentionally using the first child as a way to provoke, the author's decision to withhold the second child might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, being \"in the wrong\" usually implies a breach of trust or harm. The author isn't harming anyone by not disclosing; he's avoiding conflict. However, if the wife ever finds out the second child exists, it might feel like a betrayal. The answer hinges on balancing honesty with protecting the relationship from unnecessary strain. \n\nGiven that the author's intent was to help someone without romantic involvement, and the wife's negative reaction is part of the issue, the decision to not disclose might be understandable. So, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
