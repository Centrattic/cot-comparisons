She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who donated sperm to a single mother, had a son, then later donated again to give her a second child. He told his wife about the first child, but not the second one, because she was making him uncomfortable with teasing and jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was honest about the first donation. His wife's reaction became problematic over time, with teasing and bringing up the topic during fights. The second donation happened while his wife was pregnant, and he kept it secret to avoid further conflict.\n\nMarriage and honesty are important factors. In many relationships, transparency is expected. However, the wife's behavior might have contributed to the man's decision to withhold information. But is keeping a secret like a second child a betrayal? Maybe not, since it's not a continuing relationship or involvement beyond the donation. However, the man's wife might have a right to know if there's another child, especially if it could impact their family dynamics in the future.\n\nAlso, the wife's jokes and comments about potential incest scenarios are inappropriate and could be the root of the issue. The man's discomfort is valid, but withholding information can lead to other problems if the truth comes out later. The question is whether his secrecy is justified given the wife's behavior. Legally, there's no obligation to disclose sperm donations unless legally required. Ethically, it's more complex.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the wife is being unreasonable, maybe not. But withholding information about a second child could affect their marriage. However, the wife's actions might have led to this situation. The man's intent is to protect himself from her teasing, which is understandable. But in marriage, full disclosure is usually advised. However, given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to protect himself from a toxic dynamic. But some might argue that he's hiding something significant. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because his intentions are to avoid conflict and he was honest about the first donation.\n"
