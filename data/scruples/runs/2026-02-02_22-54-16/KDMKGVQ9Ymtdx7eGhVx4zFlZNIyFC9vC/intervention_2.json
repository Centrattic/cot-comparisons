She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. They've given a detailed scenario where the author became a sperm donor twice, first when he was 20 and then again later. He told his wife about the first child but not the second, because she reacted badly and made jokes about it. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for keeping the second child a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author did something in his past without his wife knowing initially. Then, after she learned about the first child and had a negative reaction, he decided not to disclose the second child. The question is about whether this decision makes him wrong.\n\nSo, what are the factors that determine if he's in the wrong? Well, honesty in a relationship is usually important. But there's also the aspect of how his wife is reacting. If she's using the first child as a weapon in their arguments, maybe he's justified in not telling her about the second. But then again, keeping such a big secret could also be problematic. There's also the issue of whether the wife's reactions are valid or not. If she's being overly critical or using it in a hurtful way, maybe the author has a reason to withhold the information. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the children. The second child exists, and the author is part of their genetic background. If the wife needs to know for any reason related to their family's well-being or if there are medical considerations, that's another factor. But the author might not see a need to involve his wife in this, especially if the other woman is raising the kids alone.\n\nEthically, is there a duty to disclose? The author didn't have a legal obligation, but in a marriage, transparency is usually expected. However, if the wife's reaction is harmful, maybe the author is protecting himself from further conflict. But then again, marriage requires trust and openness, so withholding such a significant fact could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not telling his wife is that she's been making jokes and teasing him, which makes him uncomfortable. But he might also be avoiding conflict. The problem here is whether the secret is harmful. If the wife never finds out, maybe it's okay. But if she does, there could be issues. However, the author's priority is his comfort and avoiding the wife's teasing, which isn't a strong enough justification for keeping a secret about a second child.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the author's actions were done before the marriage. The first donation was when he was 20, and he told her after they met. The second was during her pregnancy. So timing-wise, it's part of his past, but the second donation happened during the marriage. That might be a point. If he had a duty to disclose during the marriage, even if it's not directly related to their current family, maybe he should have told her. But if he's protecting himself from her reactions, that complicates it.\n\nIn summary, the author is withholding information about a decision he made during the marriage (the second donation) that could have implications. His wife might have a right to know, especially if there are future questions about the children or if the other family reaches out. But if he's doing it to avoid her negative behavior, it's a tough call. However, in a healthy relationship, transparency is key, so not telling her might be considered wrong. On the other hand, if the wife is using the first child as a tool for conflict, it's understandable why he wouldn't want to add fuel to the fire. Still, the decision to keep such a secret might be ethically questionable because it's a significant part of his life that could affect their family dynamics in the future.\n"
