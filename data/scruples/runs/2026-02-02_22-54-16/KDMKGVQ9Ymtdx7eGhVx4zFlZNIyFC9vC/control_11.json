She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author was a sperm donor to a woman before marrying his current wife. He told her about the first child, but when she started teasing and making jokes about it, he didn't disclose the second. Now, he's wondering if he's wrong for keeping it secret.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Open and honest communication is usually important in relationships. The author did tell his wife about the first child, but the second was a follow-up. By not being upfront, he's hiding part of the story. Even if his wife's reactions are uncomfortable, withholding information can lead to more issues. \n\nThe wife's teasing might be annoying, but that's a different issue. The author's responsibility is to be truthful. Keeping a secret about a second child could affect their relationship trust. Also, the wife might feel betrayed if she finds out later. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author feared her reaction would escalate. But the right approach would be to have an honest conversation about it and address her concerns. He should weigh the importance of transparency against her behavior. Even if she's making jokes, the author should consider that honesty is crucial. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not being truthful about the second child.\n"
