She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The author had already told his wife about the first donation, but she made him uncomfortable with her teasing and jokes. Now he's hiding the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author was a sperm donor in his 20s, had a son, told his wife when they first met. She was initially okay but later teased him. During his wife's pregnancy, the woman asked for another donation, resulting in a second son. He didn't tell his wife the second time because of her reaction to the first. Now he's conflicted about coming clean.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if he is. The main issue is honesty in a marriage. Hiding a second child is a big deal. But why? The wife's behavior was problematic, making him uncomfortable with jokes and using it in fights. The author's hesitation is understandable, but withholding such information can lead to more problems later.\n\nMarriage requires transparency. Even if the wife was unkind, the author didn't address the issue directly. Instead of keeping secrets, maybe he should have had a serious conversation about her behavior. Hiding the second child might hurt the wife when discovered. However, the wife's constant teasing and using it in arguments might justify the author's decision to protect himself from emotional harm.\n\nBut is it ethical to not share such a significant detail about his past? The second child is a fact of his life that could impact their family. If the wife found out later, it might cause more distrust. On the other hand, the wife's behavior was not supportive. The author's intention was to avoid conflict, which is understandable but not necessarily right.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued even if the other person reacts poorly. The author could have addressed the teasing and set boundaries instead of hiding the second child. So, while the wife's reaction was unfair, the author's decision to withhold the information might still be considered wrong because he's hiding a significant truth that affects their family.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he chose to keep a major secret instead of addressing the wife's behavior and being transparent.\n"
