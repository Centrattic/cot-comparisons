She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a man who donated sperm twice to a woman when he was 20, and later married someone else. He told his wife about the first child but not the second, because she kept teasing him and making jokes about it. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for keeping the second child a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Honesty in a marriage is usually important. The man didn't tell his wife about the second child, which could be seen as a betrayal because he's hiding a part of his past that affects their family. But then again, the wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing and using it as a joke during fights. That might have been a reason for him to withhold the second child's information to avoid more conflict.\n\nHowever, withholding such information could lead to bigger issues down the line. If the wife found out later, especially if the children were part of their lives somehow, it could cause more damage. Also, the fact that he used a false pretense to visit the woman (under the guise of seeing a college buddy) might be a point of contention. Did he have a responsibility to be transparent even if his wife was being difficult? \n\nAnother angle is consent. When he married his wife, did he give her all the information she needed to know? Even if she was teasing, there's a difference between not wanting to be teased and withholding significant life choices. The second child is a direct result of his actions, and not telling his wife could be seen as a lack of trust and transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife was making it so uncomfortable that he felt he couldn't share, maybe the issue lies with her behavior rather than his withholding. But in a marriage, there's an expectation of openness, especially about matters that could affect the family's dynamics. The fact that he had a second child without telling his wife could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of her teasing.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of honesty against the context of the wife's reactions. If he's keeping it secret to avoid her teasing, but the secret could have bigger consequences (like if the other kids are part of their lives or if there's a chance of the wife finding out another way), then it's a problem. Also, the fact that he used sperm donation twice might have implications for his own daughter if she ever meets the other children, which could be a future issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's teasing is unfortunate, the husband's decision to withhold the second child's existence might still be in the wrong because transparency in a marriage is crucial, even if the spouse is reacting poorly to past information. Hiding it could be seen as dishonest and potentially harmful in the long run.\n"
