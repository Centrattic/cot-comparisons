She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman who wanted to be a single mother. He told his wife about the first child, but after the wife started teasing him and making jokes, he didn't mention the second child. Now he's conflicted about whether to come clean or not.\n\nSo, the main question is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author did inform his wife about the first donation, but her reaction was negative and teasing. He decided not to disclose the second one because of her previous behavior.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty in relationships is usually important. However, there's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from harmful reactions. If the wife's behavior made him feel uncomfortable and he thought revealing the second child would escalate the situation, maybe his decision isn't entirely wrong. But on the other hand, withholding such information could be considered a lack of transparency, which might harm the relationship in the long run.\n\nAlso, the author used deception by visiting the woman under the guise of meeting a friend. That act of deception might be a point where he's wrong. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, lying about his whereabouts and intentions could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that he continued the sperm donations after the wife was already pregnant could imply that he didn't consider her feelings at all, which adds another layer of potential wrongdoing. However, the woman approached him, and he agreed, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, trust is crucial. The author's decision to keep the secret might be to avoid conflict, but it could also lead to bigger issues if the wife discovers the truth later. Whether he's in the wrong might depend on cultural or personal values around honesty versus protecting each other's feelings.\n\nBut considering that he didn't inform her about the second child, especially after the first incident, it's a matter of whether he prioritized his comfort over transparency. The deception in visiting the woman under false pretenses is a clear ethical issue. So, even if the wife's reaction was unkind, the author's actions involved lying, which could make him at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the intentional deception and lack of disclosure about the second child, despite the wife's previous reaction. The key issue is the dishonesty in his actions post-marriage, regardless of her behavior.\n"
