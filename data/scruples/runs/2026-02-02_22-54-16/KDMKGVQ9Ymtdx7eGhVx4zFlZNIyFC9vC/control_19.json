She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation after she reacted poorly to the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author donated sperm to a woman he met online when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him. When the same woman asked for a second donation, he did it secretly. Now, he's keeping the second child a secret because of his wife's reactions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. Let's break it down.\n\nMarriage is built on trust and communication. Normally, major life decisions, especially those involving children, should be discussed with a spouse. However, the author's wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing, jokes, and using it in fights. That complicates the situation. If he had told her about the second child, it might have caused more conflict. But keeping it a secret could lead to betrayal if she found out later.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't have a romantic relationship with the woman, just a sperm donation. But doing it twice without his wife's knowledge, even if she's been difficult about it, might still be considered a breach of trust. Even if the wife was acting out, the husband had a responsibility to communicate his actions.\n\nAlso, the second child is another person's life. The author might have obligations to that child, and keeping it from his wife could affect their family dynamics. However, given the wife's behavior, he might have valid reasons for not wanting to escalate the situation.\n\nLegally, in some places, there might be disclosure requirements if the husband has any parental rights or responsibilities. But the question is more about moral wrong than legal.\n\nEthically, withholding such information could be seen as dishonest. Even if the wife's reactions are unpleasant, transparency is important. The author's decision to keep it a secret might be to avoid conflict, but it's not addressing the root issues. Instead of hiding, maybe he should find a way to communicate openly despite her teasing. But the wife's behavior is also an issue\u2014using it as a joke in fights is unhealthy.\n\nIn the end, the author's secrecy could harm the marriage's trust if discovered later. However, given the wife's initial reaction and ongoing teasing, his choice might be understandable, though not entirely justified. It's a tough call between honesty and protecting oneself from a toxic reaction.\n"
