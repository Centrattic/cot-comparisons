She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. The wife already knew about the first one but is making jokes and teasing him about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author donated sperm when he was younger, told his wife about the first child, but didn't mention the second donation. The wife's reaction is causing him discomfort. The ethical question here is about honesty in a marriage versus the wife's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being truthful about the first child but hiding the second. In a marriage, transparency is important, so not disclosing a second child could be seen as a lack of honesty. However, the wife's teasing and using it as a weapon in arguments might justify his hesitation. He's not causing harm by keeping it secret, but there's a duty to be open about such a significant matter.\n\nBut then again, withholding information about a child, even if from a past relationship, could affect their marriage. The second child might have implications for their family, like inheritance or future relationships. The author might be avoiding conflict, but keeping such a secret could lead to bigger issues later.\n\nThe wife's behavior is unkind, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of the responsibility to be truthful. If he's hiding information that could impact their family, he's in the wrong. However, if the wife's reactions are malicious, maybe the author is protecting himself. It's a balance between honesty and protecting the marriage from unnecessary conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't have a relationship with the single mother beyond handshakes, so the children aren't his biologically in a parental sense. But he is the genetic father. The ethical duty might depend on his level of involvement. Since he's not involved in the kids' lives, maybe the obligation to disclose is less. However, in a marriage, any genetic children from the husband's sperm would need to be disclosed, regardless of involvement.\n\nThe author's decision not to disclose could be seen as keeping a secret that's significant enough to affect the spouse's trust. Even if the wife is teasing, the author's choice to withhold might be wrong. Alternatively, if he's been truthful about the first and the second is similar, but he's choosing not to share due to her reaction, that's a different scenario.\n\nI think the key here is that the husband has a responsibility to be honest with his spouse about matters that could impact their relationship. Even if the wife is being unkind, the husband's decision to not disclose a second child is a matter of withholding information that's relevant. Therefore, he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
