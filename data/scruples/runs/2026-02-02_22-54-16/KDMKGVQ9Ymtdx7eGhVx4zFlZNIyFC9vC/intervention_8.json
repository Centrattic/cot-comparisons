She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child when they met. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it, even making jokes during their time watching TV. Then, after the wife was pregnant, the same woman asked for another donation, resulting in a second child. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child because the first situation made him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main issue is withholding information. The wife is upset and uses the first child as a point of contention. The author feels that revealing the second child would make things worse. But is he wrong for keeping this secret?\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, transparency is usually important. However, there's a nuance here. The author didn't form a relationship with the woman, it was strictly a donation. The wife's reactions are more about teasing and using it as a joke, which might not be healthy. The author might fear escalation if he reveals the second child.\n\nBut is lying or withholding a second child a big deal? If the wife found out later, would she feel betrayed? The problem is that the author didn't disclose the second donation, even though he had a responsibility to be honest, especially regarding children. On the other hand, the wife's behavior is questionable too\u2014using it as a joke and in fights might be contributing to the author's decision to keep secrets.\n\nIn some perspectives, having a child and not informing the spouse about another biological child is a significant issue. It affects family dynamics and trust. The author might be trying to protect himself from further conflict, but the lack of disclosure could lead to more problems in the long run.\n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's teasing and jokes might have been part of the reason he didn't want to tell her again. However, from a moral standpoint, not being truthful about having another child could be seen as wrong, regardless of the wife's behavior. The author has a responsibility to be honest with his spouse about such matters, especially after the first incident. So, even if the wife is acting out, the author's decision to hide the second child could be considered a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't disclose another child, which is a significant issue in a marriage, even if the wife's behavior is problematic.\n"
