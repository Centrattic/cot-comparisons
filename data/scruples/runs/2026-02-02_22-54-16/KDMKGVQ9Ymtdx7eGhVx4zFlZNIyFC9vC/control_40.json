She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife about the first child. His wife was initially understanding but later became critical and made jokes about it. Now, there's a second child from the same woman, and he hasn't told his wife about it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing this second child.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: he was honest about the first donation but decided to hide the second one because his wife's reaction was uncomfortable. But by not disclosing the second donation, is he being dishonest? Let's consider the dynamics here.\n\nWhen he first told his wife about the first child, she was okay at first but then started teasing and making jokes, even bringing up sensitive topics like incest. That's pretty hurtful. He might feel that sharing the second child would only escalate the teasing and fights. But on the other hand, keeping such a significant secret could be seen as a breach of trust in the marriage.\n\nMarital transparency is usually important. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, the author might have a responsibility to be truthful about his actions that affect their family. By not telling her, he's hiding another layer of the same situation. The second child is a continuation of the same decision, so maybe he has to disclose it to maintain honesty in the marriage.\n\nBut wait, the wife's behavior is also a factor. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, the author might be justified in not wanting to give her another point to attack. However, withholding information about a second child could lead to more issues if she finds out later. Secrets can come back and cause bigger problems down the line.\n\nAlso, the fact that the second child was born a few months after their own child adds another layer. If the author is a biological parent to another child, that might have implications on how he's involved with that child and how it affects his responsibilities towards his wife and their daughter. The wife might have a right to know if there's another child out there that he's connected to.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't have a relationship with the woman beyond a handshake. He was a sperm donor, not a parent. So maybe the key issue here is whether the wife's reaction is unreasonable, but the author's choice to hide the second child is not his fault because of her behavior. However, hiding information in a marriage is generally frowned upon, regardless of the spouse's behavior.\n\nI think the balance here is tricky. The author's decision to not disclose might stem from protecting himself from his wife's teasing, but withholding such a significant detail could be considered wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about honesty versus protection from a spouse's negativity. In many cases, transparency is valued highly in relationships, so even if the wife is being difficult, the author might be in the wrong for not being fully honest.\n"
