She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that the author donated sperm twice to a woman, first when he was 20, and then again later when the woman asked. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife has been teasing him about the first one, making jokes, and bringing it up during fights.\n\nSo, the question is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let me break this down. First, the wife was initially understanding but later became a source of stress by teasing and making jokes. The author finds this uncomfortable. The second donation happened while the wife was pregnant with their own child, which is a time when marital trust and communication are important.\n\nOn one hand, withholding such important information could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out later that the author didn't disclose it. Even if the first time was discussed, the second instance wasn't. Being honest in a marriage is generally expected, especially regarding issues that could affect the family dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult situation. The wife's reactions are hurtful and teasing, which might make the author hesitant to share more. The author's decision could be a way to protect himself from further emotional harm. However, not sharing could lead to bigger issues if the secret comes out another way, like the wife finding out through other means, which might damage the relationship more.\n\nAnother angle: the second donation might not have been discussed with the wife, so she has a right to know about her husband's decisions that affect others. The children from the sperm donations could potentially have a complicated family situation, and the author's wife might need to be aware to handle any future situations appropriately.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's behavior, the author might be justified in not wanting to provoke more conflict. But marriage requires mutual respect and honesty. The author is choosing silence to avoid conflict, but that might not be the healthiest approach in the long run.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are deceitful. Since he didn't hide the first donation but didn't mention the second, there's inconsistency. The wife might feel that the author isn't being fully open, which is a problem. However, if the author's intention is to protect himself from the wife's teasing rather than to deceive, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. But from a marital transparency standpoint, the author might be in the wrong for not being fully honest. However, if the wife is intentionally provoking him, the author's decision could be seen as self-preservation. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because withholding such significant information can erode trust, even if the wife's reactions are unkind. Honesty is usually the better policy, even if difficult.\n"
