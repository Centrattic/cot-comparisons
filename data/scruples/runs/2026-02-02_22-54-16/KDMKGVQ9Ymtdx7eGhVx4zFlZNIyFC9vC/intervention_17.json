She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who donated sperm twice to a single mother and only told his wife about the first child. Now he's keeping the second one a secret because his wife is teasing him about the first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man donated sperm when he was young, and he told his wife about the first child. The wife's reaction was teasing and bringing it up during fights. The man then had a second donation without telling his wife. The question is whether he's wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, honesty is usually valued. But the wife's response to the first child was negative and made the man uncomfortable. If he felt that telling her would cause more conflict, maybe he's justified. However, keeping secrets, especially about something significant like a second child, can erode trust. The man has two children from his sperm that his wife doesn't know about, which could affect their family dynamics in the future.\n\nBut the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and using it as a weapon in fights\u2014might have led him to withhold information for his own mental well-being. On the other hand, hiding such a big fact could be seen as deceptive. There's also the aspect of the children's identities. If the single mother plans to contact the donor, the second child might find out through her, leading to potential confusion if the man's wife isn't aware.\n\nThe man might not be in the wrong if the wife's initial reaction made him feel unsafe to share. However, the secrecy could cause problems. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, full disclosure is necessary regardless of the partner's reaction. Others might prioritize emotional well-being and consider the man's decision to protect himself from constant teasing as understandable.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the man chose to not lie but simply not disclose in a situation where the wife's reaction was harmful, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the second donation could have implications for their family, like if the children ever meet or if there are legal aspects. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter. But the man's right to privacy in his past actions also matters. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the wife's behavior led to the decision, and the man isn't causing harm by keeping it secret. But maybe A if the secrecy is considered wrong regardless. Hmm.\n"
