She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a past where he donated sperm when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they started dating, and she was initially okay but later started making jokes and teasing him. Now, he donated again, leading to a second child, but hasn't told his wife. \n\nSo, the main question is about whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's wife was already uncomfortable with the first donation, and the author finds her teasing and jokes hurtful. He's worried that revealing the second child would cause more conflict. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually important. However, if the wife's reaction is abusive or unkind, the author might feel justified in protecting himself. But the second donation occurred after they were married and had their own child. The author didn't mention this to his wife, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. \n\nHowever, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing, making jokes about incest, and using it in fights\u2014might be considered emotionally abusive. The author might be trying to avoid further harm. But the second child is a significant fact that could affect the family, especially if the wife might find out another way or if the children's identities become known.\n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. While the author's actions were done with the intention of helping someone and have no romantic involvement, keeping such a secret, especially after the first disclosure, might be seen as withholding important information. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter, even if the author is uncomfortable with her reactions.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's teasing and jokes could be contributing to a toxic environment. The author might feel that disclosing more would exacerbate the problem. But is that a valid reason to withhold information? In many relationships, full disclosure is expected, even if the information is sensitive. The author's decision not to tell might be a way to protect himself but could lead to more issues if discovered later.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were deceitful. Since the second donation was after they were married, and he didn't inform his wife, it's a breach of trust, regardless of his reasons. Even if the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's lack of transparency could be seen as wrong. However, if the wife's reaction is part of a pattern of emotional manipulation, the author might be justified in not disclosing to protect himself from ongoing harm. But typically, in such cases, the expectation is to be honest, even if the other person's reaction is difficult. So, the answer might lean towards A (wrong) because the author didn't disclose the second child, even if the wife's behavior is questionable.\n"
