She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. They had a son, and he told his wife about it when they met. The wife initially understood but later started teasing him about it. When the wife was pregnant, the donor woman asked him to donate again, leading to a second child. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation because she was already making him uncomfortable with her comments.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether withholding the second child is wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nMarriage requires transparency and honesty. The author kept a significant secret\u2014another child from the same donor. Even though the first time he told her, the second time is a follow-up. If the wife found out later, it could cause more trust issues. The author might be avoiding conflict, but secrecy can lead to bigger problems.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction is problematic too. She's using the first child as a joke, making him uncomfortable. Maybe he feels that telling her about the second would escalate things. But still, in a marriage, major life decisions affecting both partners should be shared. The existence of a second child is a big deal. The author might not be wrong in wanting to avoid the teasing, but withholding such information could be seen as deceitful.\n\nAlso, the author had a daughter with his wife, so the implications of the donor children could have legal or emotional impacts if discovered later. Not telling her could lead to issues when the children grow older or if the donor woman contacts them again. The author's decision to hide it might be to protect himself from his wife's teasing, but that doesn't justify the secrecy.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is being unreasonable, maybe the author is in a tough spot. But the fact remains that he's keeping a significant part of his past from her. Even if the wife is being difficult, the author should handle it by communicating and setting boundaries rather than lying by omission.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the responsibility lies with both. The wife's behavior is unkind, but the author's non-disclosure is still a breach of trust. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for not being honest about the second child.\n"
