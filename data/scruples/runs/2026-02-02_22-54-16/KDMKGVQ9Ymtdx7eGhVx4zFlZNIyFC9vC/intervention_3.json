She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who donated sperm twice to a single mother. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife is teasing him about it and making jokes, which upsets him. The question is whether he's wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband had a prior relationship where he was a sperm donor. He informed his wife about the first child. The wife's reaction was negative and teasing, leading him to withhold the second child's existence. The main issue here is about honesty in a marriage versus the wife's behavior.\n\nMarital trust is important. Withholding information could be seen as dishonest, especially since the wife was already aware of the first donation. Not telling about the second might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the wife's behavior is problematic. On the other hand, the wife's constant teasing and using it during fights might be creating a hostile environment, which could justify the husband's decision to protect himself emotionally.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, not disclosing significant information about one's past, especially in a marriage, can lead to deeper issues. The husband's actions might have been to avoid conflict, but secrecy can erode trust. However, the wife's behavior is also questionable\u2014using the situation as a point of mockery during arguments isn't healthy either.\n\nThe husband might argue that since the wife was already using it against him, keeping the second donation secret is a way to prevent further emotional harm. Yet, in a marriage, transparency is usually expected. The fact that he donated sperm again after a previous agreement to be a donor might be a separate issue. The wife's knowledge of the first donor child means she might have different expectations if she knew about the second.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If we consider that he was honest about the first donation, but not the second, it's a matter of whether the second donation is a separate issue. The fact that he used his sperm again after the wife's initial reaction complicates things. Even if the wife's reaction was negative, the husband's secrecy about the second child could be seen as deceitful. However, the context of his wife's behavior might be a mitigating factor.\n\nIn many relationships, full disclosure is expected. Not telling about the second child could lead to future problems, especially if the wife finds out later. However, the wife's behavior might have pushed him to keep it secret to protect his mental well-being. It's a balance between honesty and self-preservation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are considered a betrayal of trust. Since he was open about the first donation, the second might be seen as an extension of the same situation. However, the wife's response was such that he felt compelled to lie. It's a tricky situation, but generally, withholding such information could be seen as wrong because it's a significant aspect of his life that affects the family. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n\nWait, but the wife is the one making the situation uncomfortable. If he felt that telling her would only exacerbate the problem, maybe his decision is understandable. However, in a marriage, withholding information due to the other's negative reaction isn't a valid excuse. He should have addressed the issue with her, perhaps seeking couples' counseling, instead of keeping secrets. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being fully honest, even if the wife's behavior is poor. So the answer is A.\n"
