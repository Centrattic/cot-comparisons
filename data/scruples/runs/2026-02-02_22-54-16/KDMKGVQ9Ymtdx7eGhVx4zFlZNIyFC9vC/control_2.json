She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation involves some complex family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author had a first child via sperm donation when he was 20, and he told his wife about it after they started dating. His wife was initially understanding but later became teasing and made jokes about it. Now, the author had a second child with the same donor, but he hasn't told his wife. He's worried about her reaction and the discomfort it causes.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to disclose the second child? The first time, he was honest, but the wife's reaction was problematic. The second time, he's hiding it. Is this a breach of trust? \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency is usually important. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, hiding such a significant fact could lead to more issues. The author might be avoiding conflict, but keeping secrets can erode trust. However, the wife's teasing and using it in fights could justify his hesitation. But is it wrong to withhold information because of a fear of a negative reaction?\n\nLegally, maybe there's not much, but ethically, it's about the relationship's health. If the author is married and has children, the second child might be a sibling to his wife's daughter, which could have implications. The author might be avoiding this complexity, but not disclosing it could lead to future problems if discovered. The wife might feel betrayed for not knowing, especially if there are shared responsibilities or if the second child is part of their extended family in some way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to keep it secret is driven by his wife's previous behavior, which was hurtful. It's understandable, but in a marriage, major life decisions should be mutual. The author's secrecy could be seen as a lack of honesty, which is crucial in a marriage. Even if the wife's reaction was difficult, the author should consider how his secrecy might affect their relationship in the long term.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent. Even if the wife's behavior was problematic, withholding such significant information is a breach of trust. The answer is A.\n"
