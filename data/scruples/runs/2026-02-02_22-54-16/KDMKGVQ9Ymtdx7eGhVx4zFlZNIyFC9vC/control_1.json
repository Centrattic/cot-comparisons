She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he donated sperm twice to a woman when they were in their 20s and early 30s, respectively. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes about the first child, even referencing Game of Thrones. Now he's considering not telling her about the second child because of how she reacted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. Let's look at the factors. He had the first child when he was 20, which he told his wife about. She was okay at first but later began to tease him. Then, when his wife was pregnant, he donated again, making a second child. He didn't tell her about the second one because she was already making him uncomfortable with the first.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty in a marriage is usually considered important. Not telling your spouse about another child you fathered through sperm donation could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the context matters. If the wife was using the first child to tease him and bring it up in fights, he might feel justified in withholding the second to avoid further conflict. But on the other hand, keeping such a significant secret could have long-term consequences. Maybe she has a right to know because it affects their family dynamics or future decisions.\n\nAlso, he mentioned that he visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy. That part is a bit concerning. If he was meeting her in person for the second donation, that's more than just donating \"professionally\" as he said. It could imply more involvement than he's admitting, which might be why the wife is making jokes about it. If there was any physical contact beyond a handshake, that could be another layer of the issue. But the user says he only shook her hand, so maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's reaction is part of the problem. She's using the situation to tease and mock him, which is inappropriate. However, his response is to withhold information about another child. That might be a way to protect himself, but it's not addressing the underlying issue. The right approach might have been to communicate his feelings to her and set boundaries around the topic instead of keeping a secret.\n\nIn terms of the law, in many places, sperm donation is a legal matter, and having children through this method might require disclosure to the children in the future. But the legal aspect isn't the focus here. The question is about moral wrongdoing. If he's keeping the second child a secret, it could lead to problems later, especially if the children ever meet or need to know about their biological parentage.\n\nHe also mentions that the wife makes jokes about potential incest scenarios, which is a sensitive and potentially harmful way to handle the situation. But his choice to not disclose the second child is a form of retaliation or self-protection. However, it's still a significant omission in their marriage. Trust and transparency are foundational in a relationship. By not being honest, he might be harming the relationship in the long run, even if it's to avoid immediate discomfort.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author could be in the wrong because withholding such a big secret can cause more harm than the teasing. But the wife's behavior is also problematic. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he made a decision to keep a secret about a child, which is a major family matter, that's a breach of trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child.\n"
