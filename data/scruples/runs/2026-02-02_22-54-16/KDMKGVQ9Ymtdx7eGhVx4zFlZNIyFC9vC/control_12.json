She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a son through sperm donation when he was 20, and he told his wife after they had been together for a year. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes, especially after having their own daughter. Now, the author kept the second child a secret because he felt the wife's reaction was uncomfortable and even made jokes about incest with their daughter. He's considering whether to disclose it but is unsure how to approach it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the initial disclosure, the wife's reaction, and then the decision to withhold the second child. In many relationships, honesty is a cornerstone. When you make a commitment, like marriage, partners usually expect full disclosure, especially about things that could impact the family. The first child was disclosed, but the second wasn't. The wife already has issues with the first one, so adding another could definitely escalate the situation. \n\nBut why didn't he tell her about the second child? He says she was \"weird\" and teased him. However, her reaction might be a result of the initial surprise, and her behavior could be inappropriate. On the other hand, keeping a secret about a second child, especially if the wife might not have known about the possibility of more donations, could be seen as dishonesty. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the woman asked him to donate again to have a sibling for her first son. He agreed under the pretense of visiting an old friend. That part seems a bit off. Even if the first disclosure was made, the second one is a new situation. Not telling his wife about the second child might be seen as hiding something significant. \n\nBut then, the wife's behavior is problematic. She's using the first child as a joke during fights and making uncomfortable comments. The author could feel justified in not wanting to provoke further issues. However, withholding such information might lead to bigger problems if discovered later. Trust is important in a marriage, and secrets like this can erode it. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions in donating sperm were altruistic, but the second donation wasn't disclosed. The wife's reaction is inappropriate, but that doesn't mean the author isn't in the wrong for not being transparent. There's a balance between protecting oneself from a partner's unkindness and maintaining marital honesty. \n\nMaybe the author should have addressed his wife's teasing and discussed boundaries instead of just keeping the second child a secret. But given that the wife's behavior is causing him distress, he might feel it's a last resort to not disclose. However, in the long run, not telling the truth about a second child could lead to more harm. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he did tell her about the first child but not the second. The second donation is a continuation of something he already shared. Not disclosing it could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if her reaction was unpleasant. The fact that he agreed to a second donation without her knowledge might be the bigger issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because, while the wife's behavior is unkind, the author has a responsibility to be honest about all aspects of his past that affect the family. Keeping the second child a secret adds another layer of dishonesty, which could damage the relationship further. Even if her reaction is negative, transparency is essential in a marriage, especially regarding such a significant matter.\n"
