She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who became a sperm donor twice. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife has been teasing him about it, and he's now keeping the second child a secret because of her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man made a decision to help a single mother by donating sperm. He was honest about the first child but not the second. The wife's reaction is to tease him, making jokes about it, even referencing Game of Thrones. The author is now hiding the second child to avoid similar teasing, but is that wrong?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually considered important. The wife was already upset about the first child, so the author might be trying to avoid conflict by not mentioning the second. However, by not informing her about the second child, he's withholding information that could affect their relationship dynamics. Maybe the wife has a right to know, especially if there are future implications, like if their daughter were to meet the donor children, which the wife already jokes about.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his wife's behavior. She's using the information to tease and mock him, which is unkind. If he feels that telling her the second time would lead to more of the same, maybe he's justified in not telling. However, keeping secrets in a marriage can lead to bigger issues. The author might be avoiding a confrontation but is also being dishonest.\n\nAnother angle: the second donation happened while his wife was pregnant with their own child. That's a significant time, and she might feel betrayed if she finds out later. But if she's already been made uncomfortable by the first child, he's trying to protect himself from more stress. Still, the decision to not disclose could be seen as wrong because he's not being transparent.\n\nAlso, considering the children's well-being. If the author's children ever meet the donor children, there could be issues. The author might be responsible for ensuring that the wife is aware so they can decide how to handle it. But if the wife's reaction is hostile, maybe it's better to handle it gradually.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. By not telling the wife about the second child, he's not fostering open communication. However, if the wife's teasing is malicious, maybe it's a form of emotional abuse. The author is trying to protect himself, but the secret could come out later, causing more damage.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. He's not being entirely honest, which is a problem, but the wife's behavior is also an issue. However, the expectation in a marriage is usually mutual honesty. Even if the wife is acting poorly, keeping the secret about the second child might still be considered wrong because it's a significant omission that could affect their family in the future.\n"
