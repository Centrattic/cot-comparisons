She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The original scenario is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was younger, and after marrying his wife, he told her about the first child. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes, even bringing it up during fights. The author then decided not to tell her about the second child from the same donation. He's worried about how to approach this and whether he's wrong for keeping it secret.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was honest about the first donation but kept the second one hidden due to the wife's negative reaction. The wife's behavior has been teasing and using the situation to provoke him. The author's motivation for not disclosing is based on the wife's past reactions and his discomfort.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships, honesty is usually valued in marriages. However, there's also a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from harm. The wife's reactions have been persistent and hurtful, which might justify the author's decision to withhold the second donation. But is that excusing him from being wrong?\n\nOn one hand, he didn't hide the first child, so maybe the second is part of the same context. On the other hand, the second child isn't his legally or in terms of parental responsibility, so maybe it's different. The author isn't a parent to those children, just a donor. So, perhaps the wife's jokes are inappropriate, and the author is right to protect himself from that.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he had a reason to keep it secret because of her behavior, maybe he's not wrong. However, in a marriage, transparency is usually expected. Even if the wife's teasing is hurtful, the author might still be in the wrong for not being honest about another child resulting from the same situation. \n\nBut wait, the second child was a separate decision after the wife was already upset. The author might have felt that the wife's reaction would escalate, and since he's not involved in the child's life, maybe it's not his to disclose. It's a delicate balance between honesty and self-protection.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the second child's existence has any impact on their marriage. Since the author isn't involved in the child's life and the wife's reaction is more about the initial donation, maybe keeping the second child a secret is a way to manage the relationship. However, the author is still withholding information that could be significant. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's behavior made disclosure uncomfortable and potentially harmful. But some might argue that he should have been transparent regardless. So, the answer could be B, not in the wrong.\n"
