She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child after they met a year later. Initially, she was understanding, but later started teasing and making jokes. Now, he kept the second child secret because of her reactions. The wife's comments include inappropriate questions and using \"Game of Thrones\" references, which makes him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the question is: Is he wrong for not disclosing the second child? Let's think about key factors here. Honesty in a marriage is usually important. But there's also the aspect of his wife's behavior after the first disclosure. He might feel that her teasing and using it as a weapon in arguments make it hard to tell her. However, withholding such significant information could lead to bigger problems if discovered later.\n\nHe also mentioned visiting the woman under the guise of seeing an old friend. That's a bit of a red flag. Even if there was no physical relationship, the secrecy around the visit could be an issue. The wife's trust is crucial here. By not telling her about the second child, he's hiding another part of his past. Even if the first was hard for her to handle, maybe there's a need for open communication rather than continued secrecy.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reactions are problematic too. Teasing and using it in arguments isn't healthy. But that doesn't absolve the husband of responsibility to disclose. Marital honesty usually requires both parties to handle tough topics maturely. If he's keeping secrets because of her behavior, that might not be a valid excuse. The fact that he's hiding a second child is a significant omission. Even if the first situation was difficult, the second is a new instance that affects the family dynamics. \n\nAlso, considering the potential implications\u2014like if the children ever meet or if there are legal or emotional issues down the line\u2014keeping this hidden could lead to complications. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the wife's behavior is undeniably hurtful, but the author's decision to withhold information about a second child is a breach of trust. While her reactions are part of the problem, the author isn't without fault. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for not being honest about the second child.\n"
