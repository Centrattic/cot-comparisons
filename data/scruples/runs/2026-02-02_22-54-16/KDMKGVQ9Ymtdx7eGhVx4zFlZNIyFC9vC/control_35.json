She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author did tell his wife about the first child. But his wife has been making jokes and teasing him about it, which is making him uncomfortable. Now, there's a second child, and he's not telling her because of her past reactions. \n\nThe main issue here is honesty in a marriage. The author is keeping a secret that could be significant. Even though his wife's reactions have been harsh, withholding information about a second child might cause more problems later. For example, if she finds out accidentally, that could be worse. Also, if they have a daughter together, and there's a chance of genetic relations through the donor children, that's a big deal. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is problematic too. Making jokes about it, especially after the first child, creates a hostile environment. The author might feel he's protecting his wife from potential hurt by not revealing more. But in a marriage, open communication is usually important. The author should consider discussing this with his wife, maybe in a neutral setting, to address her concerns and share the second child's existence, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, the wife's teasing and using it during fights suggests she might not take this disclosure well. The author is in a tough spot. But withholding such information could be seen as dishonesty, which is a key part of marital trust. So, even if the wife's reactions are difficult, the author might be in the wrong for not being fully transparent. So the answer would be A.\n"
