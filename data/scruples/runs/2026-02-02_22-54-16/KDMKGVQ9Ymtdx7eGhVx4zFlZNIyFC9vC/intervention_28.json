She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The situation is that he donated sperm when he was 20, had a son, and told his wife. His wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes about it. Then, after they had their own daughter, the woman who used his sperm wanted another child so they could have siblings. He donated again under the pretense of visiting an old friend. Now he hasn't told his wife about the second child because of her previous reactions.\n\nI need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points are honesty in a marriage and how the wife reacted to the first child. The wife's behavior includes teasing, making jokes about how the donation happened, bringing up the topic during fights, and making dark jokes inspired by Game of Thrones. The author is worried that telling her about the second child would make things worse.\n\nHonesty is important in a relationship, but so is emotional safety. If the wife is using the first child as a weapon in arguments, the author might be protecting himself from further conflict. However, withholding such information could lead to issues if discovered otherwise. The second child is another potential source of stress for the wife, so maybe the author is just trying to avoid escalating the situation.\n\nBut then again, not telling her could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, the author is still withholding a significant part of his past. However, the initial disclosure of the first child was made, but the second wasn't. The line is whether the second child is a separate decision made after the wife's negative reaction. The author might be justified in not wanting to endure more teasing and conflict, especially if she's using it to hurt him.\n\nSo, considering the wife's behavior and the author's reasons for not disclosing, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that full disclosure is necessary regardless. It's a tricky balance between honesty and self-protection in a relationship dynamic where the spouse's reactions are harmful.\n"
