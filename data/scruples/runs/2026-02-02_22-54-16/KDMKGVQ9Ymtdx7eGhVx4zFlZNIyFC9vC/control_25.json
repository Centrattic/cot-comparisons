She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, leading to a child. He told his wife about this before they got married, and she was initially understanding. However, over time, she started teasing him and making jokes about it, especially bringing it up during arguments. Then, when the same woman asked for another donation, he did it again but hasn't told his wife this time. He's now conflicted about whether to disclose the second child or not.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty in a marriage and the potential harm of not disclosing. Marital transparency is important. Even if the wife's reaction has been negative, withholding information about another child might be seen as deceptive. The author's reasons for not telling are that his wife was \"weird\" and teased him, but that doesn't necessarily justify withholding the information. The wife has a right to know about all aspects of her partner's past that could affect their family, especially another child. The fact that the author had a second child without his wife's knowledge adds another layer. Even if her teasing is uncomfortable, the second donation is a separate action that wasn't discussed. The author might be avoiding conflict, but not telling the truth could lead to bigger issues. So, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's secrecy about the second child could place him in the wrong because it's a significant omission that affects their marriage.\n"
