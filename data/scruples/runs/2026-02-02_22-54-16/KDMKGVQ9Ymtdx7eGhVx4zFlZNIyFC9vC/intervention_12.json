She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman who wanted to be a single mother. He told his wife after they met, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes, especially after watching Game of Thrones. He kept the second donation a secret because of her reactions.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether not disclosing the second child is wrong. From a relationship perspective, honesty is usually key. But the wife's behavior might have contributed to the author's hesitation. If she was consistently making him uncomfortable with her teasing and using it in fights, he might feel justified in not sharing more. However, the second child is a significant detail that could affect their family dynamics and the wife's feelings. Even if the first child was a surprise, the second one adds another layer. The author might be avoiding potential conflict, but withholding such information can lead to bigger issues if discovered later. \n\nEthically, the wife has the right to know about other children from her partner's sperm, especially if there are implications for their own family or if the other mother is in contact. The author might have a responsibility to disclose this, even if it's hard. But if the wife's reactions are harmful and not respectful, the author's choice to protect himself could be seen as understandable. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The wife's feelings versus the husband's discomfort. The husband didn't have a sexual relationship, just donated sperm, but the second child was a direct result of that donation. The wife might feel betrayed or have different expectations if she knew. But the husband's disclosure might also be a matter of timing and approach. Maybe he's handling it wrong by keeping it secret instead of addressing the underlying issues in their communication. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The husband might be in the wrong for not being honest, even if the wife's reactions are problematic. However, if the wife's behavior is manipulative or disrespectful, the husband could argue that he's protecting himself. The line here is tricky. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author should be honest with his wife, even if it's uncomfortable. The second child is a significant matter that affects both their relationship and the potential for future issues. But if the wife is using it as a weapon in arguments, maybe that's her fault too. However, the author's decision to withhold information is still a breach of trust. So, he is in the wrong.\n"
