She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child. The wife was initially understanding but over time started teasing and making jokes about it. Then, he donated again to the same woman to give her son a sibling. He didn't tell his wife about the second child because of her reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong for keeping the second child a secret. Let's think about the key factors here. Honesty in a marriage is important. The author did lie about not being a sperm donor again. But he had a reason\u2014his wife's teasing and jokes made him uncomfortable. However, withholding this information could affect his wife if she found out later, especially if there are implications for their family dynamics or if the children ever meet.\n\nAlso, from a relationship standpoint, keeping secrets, even if uncomfortable, might erode trust. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out later. On the other hand, the author might have thought he was protecting the relationship from further conflict. But intentionally not disclosing important information like a second child is a big deal. Even if the first child was known, the second one is a new aspect that could have different consequences.\n\nAnother angle: when he donated the second time, it was during his wife's pregnancy. That's a sensitive time, and not informing her could be seen as a lack of transparency. Also, the fact that he lied about visiting an old friend to donate shows intent to hide it. \n\nBut the wife's behavior is problematic too. Teasing and using the sperm donation as a joke during fights might have pushed him to keep the secret. However, that doesn't excuse the author from not being honest. In a marriage, both partners have a responsibility to be truthful, even if the other isn't handling the information well. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is withholding significant information that directly relates to their family. Even if the wife's reaction is unreasonable, the act of not telling the truth about having a second child is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
