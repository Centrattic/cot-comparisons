She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation when the wife was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but the wife was understanding at first but later teased him and made jokes about it. Then, he donated again without telling her, and now he's considering whether to disclose the second child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he was upfront about the first donation, the wife's reaction became problematic, and he chose not to share the second donation. The question is whether he did the wrong thing by keeping the second child a secret.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, honesty is usually valued. However, the wife's behavior might be a factor. If she's using the first donation as a weapon in arguments or making him uncomfortable, maybe the author has a reason to withhold the second. But on the other hand, withholding major life decisions, like having another child from a donation, could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if the wife is acting like a jerk, the author might still have a duty to be honest, as this could affect their family dynamics, especially if there are potential implications for their daughter or the other children.\n\nBut wait, the donation was to a single mother who wanted siblings for her first child. The author had no ongoing relationship with her, and he didn't have any parental involvement. So maybe the author isn't responsible for the second child in the same way. Still, in a marriage, sharing such significant information is important for mutual trust. The wife might have a right to know about all the circumstances that could affect their family, even if he's uncomfortable discussing it.\n\nHowever, the wife's teasing and using it as a weapon in fights complicates things. If the author is in a constant state of being attacked for the first donation, he might fear escalation by revealing the second. But hiding it could lead to a larger betrayal of trust if discovered later. The author's decision not to tell might be a way to protect himself from emotional harm, but it's also a secret that could come back to cause more issues.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't necessarily at fault for the initial decision to donate, but the second time, not informing his wife could be seen as withholding information that affects their partnership. Even if the wife is being difficult, the author should consider the long-term consequences of keeping such a secret. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's protecting himself from a hostile reaction, but the act of not disclosing could still be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's acting in self-protection given the wife's behavior, but there's a gray area here. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because withholding such information is dishonest regardless of the wife's actions. The balance between self-preservation and marital honesty is tricky here.\n"
