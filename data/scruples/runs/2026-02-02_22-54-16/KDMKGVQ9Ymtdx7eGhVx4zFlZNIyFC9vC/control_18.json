She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child. His wife was initially okay but over time started teasing and making jokes. Now, the woman asked him to donate again for a second child, and he did this secretly. He hasn't told his wife because she's been making him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in a marriage and the wife's reaction. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, which is a significant omission. Even though she was teasing, withholding that information might be considered a breach of trust. \n\nIn many relationships, open communication is essential. By not disclosing the second child, the author is keeping a secret that could affect their marriage, especially if they have to make decisions about financial support, or if the children ever meet. Also, the wife might feel betrayed upon finding out later, which could lead to more serious issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's teasing and using it in arguments might make the author feel that sharing more would only cause conflict. But that's not an excuse for withholding important information. The author's decision to keep the second child a secret could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's right to know. \n\nMarriage often requires transparency. Even if the wife is acting in a hurtful way, the author's responsibility is to be honest. Hiding the second child might lead to bigger problems down the line, like a lack of trust or the wife finding out through other means. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he didn't disclose a significant piece of information that affects their family. The answer is A.\n"
