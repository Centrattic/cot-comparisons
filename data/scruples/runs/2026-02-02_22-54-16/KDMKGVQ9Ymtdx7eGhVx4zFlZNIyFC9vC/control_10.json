She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, and told his wife after a year. The wife initially understood but later teased him and made uncomfortable comments. Then, after their daughter was born, the same woman asked for another donation, leading to a second son. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child because of her previous reaction.\n\nThe main issue here is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's break down the factors. \n\n1. **Honesty in Marriage:** Marital relationships often require transparency. Major life events, especially those involving potential genetic relations to one's family, might be considered important to disclose. The author's wife already knows about the first child, so the second one is a continuation of that situation. \n\n2. **Impact on Wife:** The wife's teasing and jokes are a problem. The author might be protecting himself from further discomfort. However, her behavior could be a reaction to underlying issues, not just the sperm donation. Maybe there's a lack of trust or other stressors contributing to her comments.\n\n3. **Potential Consequences:** If the second child exists, there could be future implications. For example, if their daughter meets the donor kids, there's a genetic relation issue. The author's wife might have a right to know about potential family connections.\n\n4. **Consistency in Disclosure:** The author told her about the first donation but not the second. This inconsistency might be seen as deceptive, even if the wife was difficult initially. The second donation is another significant event that could affect their family dynamics.\n\n5. **Author's Reasons:** He's concerned about her teasing and using it in arguments. While understandable, this doesn't necessarily justify the secrecy. Addressing her behavior might be necessary alongside disclosure.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Depending on the country, sperm donation laws vary. In some places, donors might be considered legal parents, which could have legal ramifications if not disclosed. However, the question is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\n7. **Emotional Factors:** The author is clearly stressed about this situation. His discomfort is valid, but secrecy can erode trust in a marriage over time. If he's hiding information, it might cause more harm later when discovered.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is keeping a significant secret that could affect their family. While his wife's teasing is problematic, the fact that he didn't disclose the second child adds layers of complexity. The answer hinges on whether withholding this information is morally wrong despite the wife's reaction. \n\nIf the author had a valid reason (like protecting the family from his wife's behavior), maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the secret could lead to issues (like genetic relatives meeting), then he might be. However, the initial disclosure of the first child shows he was honest, but the second is a continuation. The author's decision might be more about self-preservation and avoiding conflict, which doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is maintaining a secret that affects their family's genetic makeup, which is significant. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, the author's choice to withhold information could be seen as deceptive. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being fully transparent, even with good intentions. But others might argue that the wife's behavior justifies the secrecy. It's a tough call between honesty and protecting oneself from a hostile reaction.\n"
