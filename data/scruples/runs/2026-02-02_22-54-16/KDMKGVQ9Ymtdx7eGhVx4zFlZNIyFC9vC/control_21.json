She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him being a sperm donor twice without his wife's knowledge after the second time. He told her about the first child but not the second.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The main issue here is transparency in a marriage. The husband didn't tell his wife about the second child, even though she was already upset about the first. He has reasons: she teases him, makes jokes, and uses it in arguments. But withholding information in a marriage can be problematic. \n\nMarital trust is crucial. Even if the wife isn't a partner in raising the other children, the husband is making decisions that affect his marriage. Not disclosing the second child could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the wife had a strong reaction to the first. The husband's reason for not telling her is that he's uncomfortable with her reactions, but that doesn't necessarily justify the secrecy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he continued the donations after she was already aware of the first one might be an issue. It's possible that she would have wanted to discuss the decision to have a second child from the same donor. Even if she's using it to tease, open communication is part of being in a relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the children from the donation. If there's a chance these kids might interact with his daughter, there could be legal or emotional implications. But the main wrong here is about the lack of disclosure. \n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, there might be requirements about disclosing such things if the children could be part of the family. However, since the wife isn't involved in raising them, maybe the husband's decision isn't affecting her as much. But the emotional impact on the marriage is significant. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The act of not telling her about the second child could be seen as wrong because it's a matter that affects their relationship. Even if his wife's reactions are inappropriate, the right approach would be to communicate and find a resolution rather than continue in secret. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because withholding such information after the first disclosure undermines trust. However, if the wife is being overly cruel, maybe there's some leniency. But generally, transparency in a marriage is expected, so the husband is at fault for not being honest about the second donation.\n"
