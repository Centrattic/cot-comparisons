She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that he already had a child through donation and told his wife, but she reacted badly, making jokes and teasing him. Now there's a second child, and he's keeping it secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was honest about the first donation, which is good. But his wife's reaction has been problematic. She uses the topic to tease and even makes jokes about incest, which is hurtful. The author is now hiding the second donation to avoid further conflict. \n\nIs withholding this information wrong? Well, in a marriage, transparency is important. However, the wife's behavior seems to be the root issue here. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, maybe the author is justified in protecting himself from emotional harm. But then again, there might be implications for their daughter if she finds out later. Also, the second child is part of the author's life, so not disclosing could lead to future issues.\n\nBut the author did inform his wife about the first child. The second one happened while he was with her, so maybe there's an expectation of full disclosure. However, given her reaction, it's possible the author is protecting himself from further emotional abuse. But is it wrong to withhold information if the other person is intentionally using it to hurt?\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't inherently wrong for not telling his wife a second time if her response is harmful and unconstructive. However, there's a moral obligation to consider the potential impact on their family and the second child. The key here is whether the author is being dishonest to protect himself from a spouse who is using the information negatively. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong because the onus is on the wife to respond appropriately.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No).\n"
