She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author did tell his wife about the first donation but she's been making jokes and teasing him about it. Now, there's a second child from the same donor, and he's keeping it secret. The key points here are honesty in a marriage, the wife's reaction, and the potential impact of not disclosing.\n\nHonesty is important in relationships, especially marriage. If there's a pattern of the wife using the first child as a joke or during arguments, it shows she might not handle the second disclosure well. However, keeping a secret about having another child could be seen as dishonest, even if the reasons are understandable. The author might be protecting himself from further conflict, but withholding such significant information could also cause trust issues if found out later.\n\nThe wife's behavior is problematic too. Making jokes about incest or using the first child as a weapon in arguments isn't healthy. But the author's decision to hide the second child might be a reaction to her negative behavior. However, not being transparent, especially about having another child, could be problematic. The author might think he's avoiding conflict, but secrecy can lead to bigger issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in a tough spot. He's not intentionally harming anyone except maybe by omission. The wife's reactions are unkind, but the author's silence on the second child could be seen as a lack of full honesty. However, considering the context of his wife's behavior, it's a bit more nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for advice on how to approach the situation with empathy and communication.\n"
