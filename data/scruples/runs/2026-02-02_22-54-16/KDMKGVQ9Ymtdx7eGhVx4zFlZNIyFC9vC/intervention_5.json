She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20, had a son, and told his wife about it after a year. She was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes, which made him uncomfortable. Then, the same woman asked for a second donation, and he did it without telling his wife. Now, he's worried about how she would react and whether he should have told her.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The first time, he was honest and informed his wife, even if her reaction was not ideal. The second donation happened later, and he's choosing not to disclose it. The question is about whether that's wrong.\n\nMarriage typically involves trust and communication. Withholding information can be problematic, especially if it's something significant. However, the author's wife's reaction to the first child was causing him distress. She uses it as a tease and even during fights. So, maybe he's trying to protect himself from further conflict and emotional harm.\n\nBut then, not disclosing a second child might mean hiding a bigger truth. Even if the first was known, the second one is another level. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, transparency is usually expected in a marriage. The author might be in a tough spot because he's trying to avoid conflict, but keeping a secret like this could lead to more issues down the line.\n\nHowever, considering his wife's past behavior, maybe he's justified in not wanting to provoke her further. But in the long term, not telling could be seen as a lack of honesty. The line between self-protection and dishonesty is thin here. The author's intent is to avoid conflict, but marriage also requires honesty. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer leans towards the wife's behavior being the main issue, then the author might not be entirely at fault. But if the expectation is that he should be transparent regardless of her reaction, then he is. I need to weigh the importance of honesty versus the potential for ongoing conflict and emotional harm.\n"
