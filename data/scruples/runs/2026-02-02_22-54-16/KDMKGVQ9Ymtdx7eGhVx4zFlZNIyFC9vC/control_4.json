She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child. Now, he didn't mention the second one because his wife teases him about it. He's worried that if he tells her, she'll continue to mock him or use it during arguments. \n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty in a marriage. The wife is already upset about the first child, so the author is hiding another child. But is that okay? Well, hiding information in a relationship can be problematic. Even if the wife is being mean, the author has a right to expect some privacy and respect. However, not telling her about the second child might be seen as deceitful, especially if she finds out later. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wife's reaction is hurtful. He's not cheating; it's a sperm donation. The wife's teasing is inappropriate, but the author's silence could lead to trust issues. Maybe he should have a conversation to address her behavior before deciding to withhold information. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is being unreasonable, maybe it's not his fault. However, lying or not being transparent can be wrong. The author is choosing not to disclose, which might be seen as avoiding conflict. But in a marriage, honesty is usually expected. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the cultural or moral standards. If the wife is being unkind, the author might be justified in protecting himself. But if the act of not telling the second time is a lie, that's another issue. The first time, he was honest. The second time, he's hiding it. That could be considered deceitful. However, if the wife is using the first disclosure to tease, maybe he's not the one at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't cheating and the wife's reaction is part of the problem. But there's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from abuse. However, long-term, not telling might cause more issues. But in this specific question, the user is asking if he's in the wrong right now for not telling. Since the wife is the one being unkind, the author isn't necessarily wrong for withholding to protect his mental health.\n"
