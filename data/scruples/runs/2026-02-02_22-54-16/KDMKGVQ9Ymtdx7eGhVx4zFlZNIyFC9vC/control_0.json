She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm as a student to a woman who wanted to be a single mom. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes, especially after they had their own daughter. Then, the same woman asked for another donation, so he did it again without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for keeping this second child a secret.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the key points. The author had a prior agreement with the first woman, and after having the first child, he told his wife. His wife's reaction became problematic over time. The second donation happened when his wife was pregnant, so after they were engaged. The author didn't inform his wife about the second child because her reaction was uncomfortable for him.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, honesty in a marriage is usually expected. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, the author might have a responsibility to be truthful about such a significant matter. The second donation is a direct result of the first, so not disclosing it could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The wife has the right to know about all children from her partner's sperm donations, especially considering potential implications for their own family dynamics and genetic ties.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is part of the context. She's been making jokes and using it as a point of contention. The author might feel justified in withholding the information to avoid further conflict. But even if the wife's reaction is harsh, the author's decision to keep the second child a secret could be seen as deceitful. There's a difference between withholding information to avoid conflict and being dishonest about a significant family secret.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. If he's hiding the second child to protect himself from his wife's teasing, that might not excuse the secrecy. The wife has a right to know about all children she might have genetic ties to, especially if their own daughter is growing up and there could be future implications, like the hypothetical scenario mentioned involving their daughter and the donor sons.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and social aspects. In many places, there might be laws about disclosing donor information to children, but since these are his children, there could be legal responsibilities he's not fulfilling by not informing his wife. The author might also be hiding the fact that he continued as a donor after the initial agreement, which could be a breach of trust in the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction is clearly an issue. If she's using the information to tease or provoke, the author is in a tough spot. But even so, transparency is usually the healthier approach in a relationship. Maybe the author should address the issue directly, even if it's uncomfortable, rather than keeping it hidden. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not necessarily what he should do next.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is withholding a significant piece of information from his spouse, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, the act of not disclosing the second child is a secret that affects their family. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being honest, despite the wife's behavior.\n"
