She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that he donated sperm when he was 20, and his wife found out a year later. She was initially understanding but started teasing and making jokes about it. Then, when his wife was pregnant, he donated again without telling her, leading to a second child. Now he's keeping it a secret because he's uncomfortable with her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The main issue is whether the author has an obligation to disclose the second donation. Let's break it down. \n\nHe told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife's initial reaction was okay but became problematic over time. The author feels that telling her about the second child would lead to more teasing and conflict. But is it his responsibility to keep her informed regardless of her reaction?\n\nMarital honesty is usually considered important. Even if the spouse's reaction is negative, the expectation in a marriage is that both partners are truthful with each other. The author's decision not to disclose could be seen as a violation of that trust. However, the wife's behavior (teasing, jokes during fights) might make it understandable why he's reluctant. But that doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility for not being honest.\n\nAnother angle: the second donation happened during the time his wife was pregnant with their daughter. That's a significant detail. He used a pretense (visiting an old friend) to donate again. This suggests he was already keeping the second donation secret from the start. If he had told his wife about the first child, maybe he should have discussed the possibility of another donation at that time. Not doing so might have been negligent in considering her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used his sperm twice for the same woman means there's a larger family connection. If the children from the donations have siblings, there might be implications for his own daughter if they ever meet, as the wife joked about. The author's non-disclosure could lead to future problems if the other children find out or if the wife discovers the truth later. This could cause more harm than if he had addressed it openly.\n\nBut then again, the wife's reactions are part of the problem. If she's using the situation to tease and provoke, it's a communication issue in the marriage. However, that doesn't justify the author's secret-keeping. The decision to not disclose the second child is a choice made by the author, which has its own consequences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the standard answer in such cases is usually that honesty is essential in a marriage, regardless of the spouse's reaction. While the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's withholding of information is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he chose not to be honest with his wife, which is a fundamental issue in the relationship.\n"
