She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him and making jokes, especially referencing Game of Thrones. Then, he donated again secretly, resulting in a second child. Now, he's keeping this second child a secret because his wife's reaction to the first one was uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the key points here are: disclosure of the first child, the wife's reaction, and then the decision to hide the second child. The author is worried about her reaction again. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, honesty is usually valued. However, the wife's behavior might complicate things. If she's using the first child as a way to tease and provoke, that's not healthy. But the author's decision to withhold information about the second child could lead to bigger issues later. Even if her initial reaction was negative, there's a responsibility to be honest about such a significant matter, especially if it could affect their family dynamics in the future.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not telling is based on his discomfort, not her well-being. There might be implications for the second child, like potential future contact or legal matters. The author might be avoiding conflict, but hiding such a big secret could lead to more problems down the line. So, while the wife's teasing is problematic, the author's secrecy about the second child could be seen as dishonest, which might make him at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is intentionally provoking him with the first child, that's her issue. But the author has a responsibility to be truthful. Even if the timing or manner of disclosure is tricky, keeping it secret could be considered wrong because it's a significant part of his past that affects their family. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) for not being honest about the second child despite the wife's behavior.\n"
