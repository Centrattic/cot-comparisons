She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but after some teasing and discomfort, he kept the second child a secret. The key points here are honesty in a marriage and the potential impact of not sharing this information.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, transparency is usually valued. The wife was already upset about the first child, so hiding the second one might be seen as deceitful. But the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and using it in fights\u2014could make the author hesitant. The question is whether keeping the secret is justifiable given the wife's reaction.\n\nHowever, withholding such significant information could lead to future problems. If the wife found out later, it might cause more trust issues. The author might be protecting himself from ongoing conflict, but marriage requires mutual honesty. Even if the wife's response is negative, not disclosing could erode trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is also problematic. Her jokes and using the issue in fights aren't healthy. But that doesn't absolve the author of the responsibility to be honest. He might feel it's a matter of self-protection, but in a healthy relationship, both partners should address issues constructively.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is withholding important information without a compelling reason beyond his own discomfort. While the wife's actions are not justified, the author's secrecy could be seen as a failure to maintain transparency. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
