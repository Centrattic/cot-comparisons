She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife about the first child. The wife wasn't happy and started teasing him. Then, after he and his wife had their own child, the same woman asked for another donation, which he did, resulting in a second child. He didn't tell his wife about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. When you get married, there's an expectation of honesty and transparency in the relationship. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even though the first situation was already a past event, keeping the second one secret might be problematic because it's a significant omission.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the first child was extremely negative and mocking, to the point of making the author uncomfortable. He might feel that revealing the second child would only escalate the issues, especially since she uses it as a way to tease or fight with him. The author's decision not to disclose could be a way to protect himself from further emotional harm.\n\nBut marriage requires mutual trust. By not disclosing the second child, he's hiding a part of his past that's directly related to his marital life. Even if the first situation was handled poorly by the wife, the second donation is a new action that he took after they were married. So, technically, he didn't inform her about a new child that he contributed to, which is a significant omission.\n\nHowever, maybe the author doesn't see it as a big deal since the donor children aren't his legal responsibility and he's not involved in their upbringing. But from a relationship standpoint, not sharing such information can lead to bigger issues. The wife might feel lied to or deceived if she finds out later. There's also the aspect of potential future complications if the children ever meet the author's current family.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, he's being honest about the first child but not the second. On the other, the wife's behavior makes him reluctant to disclose more. But in a marriage, big secrets can cause problems. So while the wife's behavior is indeed problematic, the author's decision to keep the second child a secret might still be considered wrong because it's a matter of transparency and trust in the marriage.\n\nI think the key here is whether the act of donating sperm again after marriage requires disclosure. Since the wife was already aware of the first donation, the second one is a continuation of that same action. Therefore, the author's failure to inform her about the second donation, even if done in a different context, might be seen as a breach of trust. So, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted because the wife's behavior is also an issue. But the question is about the author being in the wrong, so maybe A is the right choice here.\n"
