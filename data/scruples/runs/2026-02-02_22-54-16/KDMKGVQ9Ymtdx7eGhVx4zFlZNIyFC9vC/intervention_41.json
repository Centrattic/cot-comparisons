She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. \n\nFirst, he donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child after they met, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him. Then he donated again without her knowing, and now he's keeping it secret because she's been making jokes and bringing it up during fights.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not disclosing the second donation. Let me break down the points. The wife found out about the first child and reacted negatively. The author didn't want to add more stress by telling her about the second. But withholding information can strain a marriage. \n\nOn one hand, the wife had the right to know, especially since they have their own child. Keeping such a big secret might affect their relationship. On the other hand, the wife's teasing and using it as a weapon in arguments could make the author feel like it's not worth bringing up again. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? He did tell her about the first donation, which shows he wasn't hiding it from the start. The second donation was a follow-up, but maybe he thought it would just lead to more conflict. Still, keeping a second child secret could be seen as dishonesty, especially if the wife's behavior is a result of feeling untrusted or if there are potential implications for their family dynamics. \n\nHowever, the wife's reaction seems to be more about teasing and using the situation against him, rather than a genuine issue. If the author is in a safe, loving relationship otherwise, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to avoid unnecessary conflict. But there's also the aspect of transparency in a marriage. Big secrets can lead to bigger problems. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the wife's behavior. If she's using it to belittle him or in fights, maybe the author's choice is understandable. But if he's hiding information that could affect their family in the future, that's a different matter. It's a tough call. The answer isn't black and white, but the author's intentions (avoiding conflict due to her teasing) might make him not entirely in the wrong. So I lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
