She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm when they were 20 to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child later, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him and making jokes about it, even bringing up Game of Thrones references. Then, when the woman asked for another donation to have a sibling for the first child, the author did so again without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to keep the second child a secret.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The author's wife was already upset about the first donation. The author felt it was important to maintain a professional, non-romantic relationship with the sperm recipient, which he explained. The second donation was done under the guise of visiting a college friend. The author's main concern is that his wife's reactions are hurtful and that he doesn't want to cause more conflict by revealing the second child.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually a cornerstone. The author did tell his wife about the first child, but the way she reacted made him withhold the second. However, by not disclosing the second donation, he's hiding a significant part of his past actions. Even though his wife's behavior is problematic, keeping such information can affect trust in the relationship. The author's decision to not share the second donation might be seen as a way to protect himself from further teasing, but it also means not being fully transparent with his spouse.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. The second donation was done after the author had a child with his wife. The woman wanted siblings for her son, which the author agreed to. The author didn't have a romantic involvement, but the act of donating sperm again might have implications, especially if the wife were to find out later. The author's wife could feel betrayed if she found out through other means, which might cause bigger issues.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior here is also questionable. Teasing and using the situation as a weapon in arguments is unhealthy. The author might have felt justified in not disclosing the second donation because of her reactions. But withholding such information can lead to a breakdown in trust, which is crucial in a marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about the first child but not the second. On the other hand, his wife's behavior is the reason he's withholding. So, is the wrong in not telling, or is it in the wife's treatment of the subject?\n\nIn relationships, while both partners have responsibilities, transparency is usually expected. The author's wife's behavior is problematic, but the author's decision to not disclose the second donation might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife is teasing, the author could have addressed the issue, perhaps by setting boundaries or seeking counseling, rather than hiding the second child. So, while the wife's actions are contributing to the problem, the author's choice to withhold information could be considered in the wrong, as it's a significant omission that could affect their relationship negatively.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the wife is being difficult, withholding such important information without addressing the underlying issues in the relationship can be harmful. The author should have found a way to communicate openly, even if it's difficult, to maintain trust and address the wife's concerns rather than hiding it all."
