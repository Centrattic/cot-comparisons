She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who donated sperm twice to a single mother when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been making jokes and teasing him about the first donation, which makes him uncomfortable. He's considering not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When he donated sperm, he was young and in a different life phase. The first donation happened when he was 20, and he told his wife after they met. The wife's reaction has been problematic over time, especially since they have their own daughter. The second donation was done to provide a sibling for the first child, and he did it secretly during the time his wife was pregnant. He didn't disclose the second one because of her past reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child. On one hand, marital trust and honesty are important. By not disclosing the second donation, he's hiding information from his wife, which could be seen as deceitful. However, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing, joking about Joffrey from Game of Thrones, bringing it up in fights\u2014has made him feel uncomfortable. He might be protecting himself from further conflict or emotional harm.\n\nBut there's a balance between self-protection and marital transparency. Even if the wife's reactions are hurtful, withholding such significant information (having another child) could lead to bigger issues down the line. The second child is a part of his life and might have implications for their family, including legal or emotional aspects. For example, if the wife finds out later in a different context, it might cause more damage. Also, the fact that he lied by visiting under the guise of seeing a friend raises ethical questions. Deception in a marriage is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reasons.\n\nHowever, the wife's constant teasing and using it as a weapon in arguments is not acceptable. She's creating a hostile environment, which might justify his decision to keep things private. But marriage requires mutual respect and honesty. Even if he feels uncomfortable, there's a responsibility to communicate openly. Maybe he could have addressed the jokes and set boundaries instead of hiding the second child. \n\nAnother angle: if he had told her about the second donation, perhaps the wife would have reacted more constructively. But if she's using it to tease or fight, he might be protecting himself from ongoing pain. Still, the decision to keep such a secret after committing to a marriage could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that he donated twice, and the second time during her pregnancy, without her knowledge, adds layers of complexity. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's no clear right or wrong. But from a relationship standpoint, transparency is usually valued. Even if the wife is unkind, the husband's secrecy could harm the relationship further. However, his actions might stem from self-preservation given her behavior. So, it's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, withholding such information could be seen as wrong, even if the spouse's behavior is problematic.\n"
