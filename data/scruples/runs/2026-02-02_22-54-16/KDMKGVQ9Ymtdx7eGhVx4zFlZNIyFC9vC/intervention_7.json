She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The key points here are the context of the first donation, his wife's reaction, and the decision to keep it secret.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was younger, and he told his wife about the first child. She was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes. This behavior made him uncomfortable. Then, after his wife was pregnant with their own child, he agreed to a second donation without her knowledge.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether withholding the second donation is wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The wife's reaction to the first donation was problematic\u2014teasing, using it as a joke, and even making references to TV shows. The author felt that her behavior was hurtful and persistent, so he might have thought that revealing the second child would only escalate the tension.\n\nBut then, from an ethical standpoint, withholding such information could be seen as dishonesty. The wife has a right to know about all the genetic children her partner has, especially since they have their own child. However, the author's reasoning is that his wife's initial reaction made him fear further conflict or hurt. There's also the aspect of consent: when they married, did he have the right to decide not to disclose another child, especially if it could affect their family dynamics or future decisions?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to keep it secret might be seen as a way to protect his own mental health and avoid unnecessary stress. If his wife was already using the first donation as a source of teasing, adding another child might not be beneficial. But the question is whether the act of keeping it secret crosses a line into deceit, especially since the second donation happened after they were married. There's a difference between not disclosing past information and creating new, undisclosed genetic ties without the spouse's knowledge.\n\nHowever, the author's wife might have a valid concern here. If she discovers the second child later, she might feel betrayed, especially if the first was already a point of contention. The author might be avoiding a confrontation, but the secrecy itself could be harmful if discovered. There's also the aspect of trust in a marriage. Being honest about such matters is usually considered important, even if the other person reacts negatively.\n\nIn terms of ethics, transparency is generally valued, but so is the right to personal boundaries. The author's discomfort and the wife's behavior complicate things. The author's actions were done with the intention of avoiding conflict, but the lack of disclosure could be seen as a breach of marital trust.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the act of not disclosing the second donation is a moral failure. If the author's wife's behavior is toxic, maybe he's justified in protecting himself. But if the information could affect their marriage and future decisions, then not disclosing is wrong. However, given the context, the author's decision to withhold might be more about self-preservation than deceit, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
