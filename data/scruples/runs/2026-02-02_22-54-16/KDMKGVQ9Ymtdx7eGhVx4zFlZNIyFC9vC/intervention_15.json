She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author donating sperm to a woman when he was 20, which he told his wife about. The wife initially understood but later started teasing him and making jokes, even bringing up the topic during fights. Then, after the wife's pregnancy, the donor's mother asked him to donate again, and he did so secretly. Now, the author is considering not telling his wife about the second child because of her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author was honest about the first donation but chose to keep the second one a secret. The wife's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014teasing, making inappropriate jokes, and using it as a weapon in arguments. That's not okay. However, the author's decision not to disclose the second donation could be seen as a way to protect himself from ongoing harassment. \n\nBut is withholding that information wrong? The wife has a right to know about her husband's biological children, especially if she's raising a daughter and there are potential genetic risks. The author's silence might prevent the wife from making informed decisions about their family's future. However, if the wife continues to use the first donation as a way to mock and control the situation, the author might feel justified in not disclosing the second child to avoid further conflict and emotional harm.\n\nOn one hand, the author withheld information that could be important for their children's medical and familial history. On the other hand, the wife's behavior was toxic, and the author's secrecy is a coping mechanism. The key issue is whether the author's intent was malicious or self-preservation. Since the author donated anonymously and the wife has been unkind, it's a complex situation. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the wife's reactions are inappropriate, and he's trying to protect himself. However, there's a responsibility to disclose such information for the sake of transparency and the family's well-being. But given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the wife's behavior is the main issue, and the author acted to avoid harm.\n"
