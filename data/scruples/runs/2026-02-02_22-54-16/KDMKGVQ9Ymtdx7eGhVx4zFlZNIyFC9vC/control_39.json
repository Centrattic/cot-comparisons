She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation after she gave him a hard time about the first one. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man donated sperm when he was 20, told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been teasing him about it, making him uncomfortable. He's worried about her reaction if he tells her about the second child.\n\nNow, I should think about what's important here. Honesty in a marriage is a big factor. He was upfront about the first donation, which shows he initially valued transparency. However, hiding the second donation might be seen as a lack of honesty, especially if the wife had a right to know. But then again, if she's been unkind and making jokes, maybe he has a reason to withhold the information to protect himself emotionally.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife. If she found out later, would she feel betrayed? But since she's already aware of the first child, maybe she could handle the second. However, the man might feel that her teasing is not a valid reason to lie. Also, the second donation happened while they were in a serious relationship (then-fianc\u00e9e), which could mean he had a duty to inform her about both children, especially if they were close in timing.\n\nThe question is whether not disclosing the second child is the man's fault. If the wife had a right to know, then he's in the wrong. But if her reaction was so negative that it's protecting their relationship by not telling her, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, marriage typically requires full disclosure of major life decisions.\n\nI should also consider if there's any deceit involved. He hid information that could affect their family dynamics. Even if the wife was being unkind, withholding such a significant fact might be considered wrong because it's a matter of trust. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) for not being honest, even if the wife's reaction is problematic.\n"
