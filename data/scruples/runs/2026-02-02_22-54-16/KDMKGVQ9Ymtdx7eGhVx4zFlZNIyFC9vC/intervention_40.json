She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm as a young man to a woman who wanted to be a single mom. He told his wife about the first child years later, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him. Then, when the woman asked for another donation, he did it again, keeping his wife in the dark. Now he's conflicted about whether to tell her.\n\nSo, the question is whether not disclosing the second child makes him wrong. Let's consider the key points. When he married his wife, he was already aware of the first child and had shared that. The second donation happened after they were married, possibly when his wife was pregnant with their daughter. The wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing, jokes about incest, etc.\u2014which made him not want to disclose the second. \n\nMarriage usually involves transparency, but there's a nuance here. The author didn't enter into the marriage with the second child in existence. The second donation occurred post-marriage, so maybe he didn't want to bring up past actions that his wife was already upset about. However, intentionally keeping a secret about a child from his past (even if he had no contact) could be seen as a lack of honesty. But on the other hand, the wife's behavior was clearly toxic and used the first child as a weapon. The author might be protecting himself from further conflict.\n\nBut the second child's existence is a new fact that could affect their family dynamics. Not disclosing it could lead to bigger issues down the line. However, if the wife is using the first child to tease and humiliate, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to give her another tool for that. \n\nThe line between secrecy and privacy can be blurry. If the author had no contact, no responsibility, and the wife is already using the first child in a harmful way, maybe he's not wrong for not telling. But if the second child is a significant fact of his life that could impact their marriage, then it's a different story. \n\nAlso, consider intent. Did he donate the second child to help a single mother, with no intention of having a relationship? That's clear from the story. The second donation was purely to help the child have a sibling. The wife's reaction is more about her own issues. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the key is whether he intentionally withheld information that's critical for their marriage. Since the second child is a result of a past action, and the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's choice to not disclose might stem from protecting himself. However, withholding such a significant life event could be seen as a lack of transparency. \n\nBut given the context of the wife's behavior, it's a complex situation where the author is trying to manage an abusive dynamic. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the marriage requires full disclosure, then maybe he is. It's a tough call. However, since the second donation was after marriage and the wife's reactions are toxic, the author's decision might be more about self-preservation than deceit. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
