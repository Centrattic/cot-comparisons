She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who donated sperm twice to a single mother, and he told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife is making jokes and teasing him about the first child, so he's decided not to tell her about the second.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man donated sperm when he was 20, which he told his wife about after a year. She initially was understanding but later started teasing him, making him uncomfortable. The second donation happened while his wife was pregnant, and he didn't tell her about the second child. The wife's reactions include making jokes about his past and even referencing Game of Thrones to mock the situation. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether he's wrong for not disclosing the second child. On one hand, not telling his wife about the second child could be seen as a lack of transparency in the marriage. Honesty is important in relationships, and withholding such information might lead to trust issues later on. However, the wife's behavior towards the first child's existence is problematic. She's using it as a teasing tool and bringing it up in fights, which is emotionally manipulative. The man might be trying to protect himself from further emotional harm by not sharing the second child.\n\nNow, considering the man's intentions. He didn't have a romantic relationship with the single mother, just a professional arrangement. He provided sperm, and there's no indication of deceit in the first donation. The second donation was done under the guise of visiting a friend, which is a bit sneaky, but he might have done it to avoid confrontation with his wife. However, the fact that he made a decision without her knowledge raises questions about his responsibility to be honest in the marriage.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, partners are expected to communicate openly, especially about significant life events. Having a second child with another woman is a major aspect that could affect the relationship dynamics. Even if the wife is teasing, the husband's choice to withhold this information could lead to resentment or betrayal if she finds out later. On the flip side, the wife's behavior is not helping. Her jokes and teasing are creating a hostile environment, which might justify the man's decision to keep it secret as a form of self-preservation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The wife might have a right to know because it's a part of his past and present actions that could impact their family. However, the way the wife is reacting might be pushing him to keep things hidden. It's a bit of a dilemma between honesty and protecting oneself from emotional abuse.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while sperm donation can be a personal choice, sharing such information with a spouse is typically expected. But if the spouse is using it as a weapon in their relationship, that's a separate issue. The man might be in a difficult position where either choice has negative consequences.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If we judge based on the act of not telling his wife about the second child, it could be seen as dishonest. However, the context of his wife's behavior complicates things. If she's making him feel bad and he's trying to avoid further conflict, maybe he's not entirely at fault. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have their own issues. The key factors are the intent behind not telling and the impact of the wife's behavior. If the man's intention is to protect himself from emotional harm rather than to deceive, it might be more about self-protection. However, in a healthy relationship, communication is key, so not disclosing such a significant detail could still be considered wrong regardless of the wife's behavior.\n"
