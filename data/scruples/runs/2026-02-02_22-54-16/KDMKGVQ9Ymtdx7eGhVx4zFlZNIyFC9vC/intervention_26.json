She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a single mother when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after a year. The wife was initially understanding but later became critical and made jokes, which upset him. Now, he didn't tell her about the second child because of the negative reaction.\n\nI need to consider ethical and relational aspects. Honesty in a relationship is important, but so is the context and the potential for harm. The wife's teasing and jokes indicate that she's using this information in a hurtful way. The author might be withholding it to avoid further conflict or emotional harm. \n\nIs keeping the second child a secret a betrayal? The author isn't hiding the fact that he was a sperm donor; he's just not revealing the extent of it. The wife's reaction is part of the problem here. If the author had told her about the second child and she continued to mock him, that could be a different issue. But the author's decision is based on his wife's behavior, which might be a form of self-protection.\n\nAlso, the children are being raised by someone else, and the author isn't involved. The key here is whether the secret affects the wife in a significant way. Since the wife isn't a parent to those children and the author's actions are past and separate from their relationship, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it private after the negative response. \n\nHowever, some might argue that withholding such information, even if the wife is cruel, could lead to future issues. But given the circumstances, the author is trying to protect himself from ongoing teasing and conflict. So, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
