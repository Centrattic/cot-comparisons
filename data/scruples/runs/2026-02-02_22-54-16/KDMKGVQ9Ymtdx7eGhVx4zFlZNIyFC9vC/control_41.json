She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author donated sperm twice to a woman, told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife has been making jokes and teasing him about it, which makes him uncomfortable, so he's keeping the second child a secret. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether withholding the second child's existence is ethical or not. The author argues that he didn't tell his wife the second time because she was already making him uncomfortable with the first. He's concerned that bringing it up again would lead to more teasing or be used in arguments.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually valued. However, the wife's reaction complicates things. If the wife is using the first child to tease or provoke, the author might feel justified in not adding more stress by revealing the second. But there's a potential problem here: not disclosing something significant like a second child from the same donation could affect trust in the marriage. Even if the wife is acting in a teasing manner, the author hasn't discussed the possibility of her reaction to the second child. Maybe she would handle it differently, or maybe she wouldn't care. Alternatively, she might feel betrayed that he kept another secret.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical responsibility to the children. The author might be involved in some capacity with the second child, but the scenario doesn't mention him having any legal or financial responsibility. If he's not involved beyond the donation, then perhaps the ethical obligation is less clear. However, if the wife is aware of his role in the first child, not mentioning the second could be seen as a lack of transparency.\n\nAlso, the author's reasons for not telling are based on the wife's past behavior, which is a valid concern. People might hide things when they fear negative reactions. But the question is whether the action (withholding the information) is wrong. Some might argue that even if the wife's reactions are problematic, honesty is better in a marriage, and the author should address her teasing instead of keeping secrets. Others might say that the author is protecting himself from emotional harm and that the second child's existence isn't relevant to the marriage if he's not involved.\n\nI should also consider the legal aspect. Depending on the jurisdiction, sperm donation might have legal implications regarding parenthood. If the author has legal rights or responsibilities towards the second child, not informing his wife could affect her rights as a spouse. However, the scenario doesn't mention legal involvement, so maybe that's not the main point here.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the balance between honesty in a relationship and protecting oneself from a spouse's potentially hurtful behavior. Some people might say that the author is in the wrong because he's witholding information that could be important, especially if the wife discovers it later and feels betrayed. Others might say he's not wrong because the wife's behavior is the root issue, and he's trying to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nThe part about the wife making jokes about incest via Game of Thrones is a red flag. If the author is concerned that she might use the first child's existence to tease in that way, maybe the second child's existence could escalate that. However, the author's decision to not tell might prevent that, but it's also hiding a secret.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm torn. On one hand, honesty is typically the best policy in a marriage. On the other hand, if the wife is using the information to tease and provoke, the author's choice to withhold could be a form of self-preservation. But keeping secrets, even for good reasons, can erode trust. The line between protecting oneself and being dishonest is blurry here. I think the key is whether the author's actions are harmful. If the second child's existence doesn't impact their marriage directly, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, if there's a chance it could cause issues later, then withholding might be problematic.\n\nIn the end, I think the answer hinges on societal expectations of transparency. If the author is considered responsible for being honest regardless of the wife's behavior, then he's in the wrong (A). If the wife's behavior is the main issue and the author is just protecting himself, then he's not in the wrong (B). Given that the wife already knows about the first child and is using it against him, the author's decision to withhold the second might be seen as a reasonable choice to avoid further conflict, so B might be the answer.\n"
