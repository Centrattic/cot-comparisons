She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he donated sperm to a single mother when he was 20 and she had a son. He told his wife about it when they first met, and she was understanding but later started teasing him about it. Then, after they had their own daughter, the single mother asked him to donate again for a second child. He did so without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was honest about the first donation. He told his wife when they first met, even though she initially seemed okay with it. But over time, her reaction became more negative and teasing. The author is now hiding the second donation to avoid further conflict and discomfort. \n\nIs there a duty to disclose the second donation? Well, in a marriage, honesty is usually expected. However, the wife's reaction was problematic. She used the first donation to tease him and make jokes, which is not a healthy way to handle the situation. The author might feel that continuing to bring up the second donation would escalate the tension. \n\nBut on the other hand, the second child is also his biological child. In many places, there are legal implications for sperm donors, especially if they're not anonymous. If the author is a legal parent to both children, he has a responsibility towards them, but maybe not to his wife. However, his wife might have a right to know if there's another child, especially if there are legal or emotional implications for their family. \n\nWait, the author says he donated under the guise of seeing an old friend. That suggests he intentionally concealed the second donation. If his wife is his legal spouse, she might have a right to know about other biological children, especially if there's a chance of them meeting or if it affects their family dynamics. But the wife's behavior has been unkind, making the author feel uncomfortable. So there's a conflict between the duty to be honest and the fear of a negative reaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to avoid conflict. But withholding such information could lead to bigger issues later. For example, if the wife finds out through other means, she might feel betrayed. Alternatively, if she's already making jokes about the first child, maybe she's using it to provoke him, and the second child could be another point of contention. \n\nHowever, the wife's actions are also questionable. Teasing and making jokes about something like this is not supportive. If the author tried to communicate his feelings to her about how her teasing is hurting him, maybe she would stop. But if he hasn't tried that yet, maybe he's just avoiding confrontation. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because he was honest initially and the wife's reaction was inappropriate. However, the second donation is an ongoing situation where honesty is usually the best policy. By not disclosing, he's not being fully transparent, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's intent wasn't to deceive his wife about the second child; he was trying to avoid further conflict. It's a tough spot. So, is he in the wrong? If the wife had a right to know about the second child, then yes. But if the wife's reaction was so negative that it's a form of emotional abuse or manipulation, maybe the author's decision is understandable. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's non-disclosure is a deliberate act of deception. Since he didn't tell her, but the wife's behavior is problematic, it's a balance. The author might be in the wrong for not being honest about the second child, even if the wife was rude. Honesty is generally a cornerstone in relationships. However, the wife's behavior could mitigate some of that blame. But in most cases, withholding information about a second child, especially a biological one, could be considered dishonest. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the wife's actions are the main issue, then the author might not be in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
