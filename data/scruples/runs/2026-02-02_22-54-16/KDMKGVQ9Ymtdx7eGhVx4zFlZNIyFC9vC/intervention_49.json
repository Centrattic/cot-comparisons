She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he donated sperm twice to a single mother, first when he was 20 and later again when his wife was pregnant. He told his wife about the first donation, but not the second. His wife has been making jokes and teasing him about the first child, which makes him uncomfortable. Now he's wondering if he's wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are honesty in the relationship and the impact of his actions. He did come clean about the first donation, which shows he tried to be upfront. But the second one was kept secret. His reasoning is that his wife's reaction to the first was so negative and ongoing that he didn't want to cause more conflict. But is withholding that information dishonest?\n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If he didn't tell her about the second child, even though the first was known, that could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if she was teasing, he might have thought that transparency was better. However, he might also feel that her reactions were unkind and that sharing the second donation would escalate the situation. \n\nBut then again, keeping a secret about having a second child from someone else could be a big deal. The wife might have a right to know, especially if they have their own child together. There could be implications for their daughter in the future if the other children are part of the family in some way. Also, the fact that he used a different method (visiting under the guise of a college buddy) might add to the secrecy, making it feel more like a lie.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is using the first child as a way to tease and provoke, the author might be protecting himself from emotional harm. But is withholding the second child's existence fair? It's a tough balance between self-preservation and being honest with a spouse. \n\nI think the main issue is whether not telling her about the second donation is a lie. If he was truthful about the first, then hiding the second could be seen as deceptive. However, if he felt that she wasn't processing the first information well, maybe his intention wasn't malicious. Still, in most relationships, full disclosure is expected, especially regarding such significant matters. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being honest about the second donation. \n\nBut I also have to consider the context of his wife's behavior. If she's been unkind and using it against him, he might feel justified in not sharing more. However, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The rightness or wrongness might depend on the norms of their relationship and communication. \n\nIn the end, I think the author is in the wrong because he withheld important information from his wife, which could affect their family dynamics and trust. Even if her reactions were problematic, transparency is usually the healthier choice in a marriage. So, answer A.\n"
