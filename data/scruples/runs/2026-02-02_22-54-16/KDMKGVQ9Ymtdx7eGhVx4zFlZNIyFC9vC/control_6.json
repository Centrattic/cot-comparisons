She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who donated sperm twice to a single mother, told his wife about the first child but not the second, and his wife has been teasing him about it. The author is considering whether to tell her about the second child but is hesitant because of her reaction to the first.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if not disclosing the second child is wrong. The key points here are honesty in a marriage, the wife's reactions, and the author's intentions. The author did tell his wife about the first donation when they first met, but she has been making jokes and teasing him since then. He didn't mention the second donation because he's worried her reaction would be worse. \n\nMarriage requires trust and transparency. Even if the first disclosure was met with some teasing, the second instance could be seen as a continuation of the same situation. By not telling her about the second child, he's withholding information that directly relates to the first situation. The wife's behavior might be immature, but the author's responsibility is to maintain honesty in the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author might have valid reasons. If the wife's teasing is hurtful and he's trying to avoid conflict, maybe he's trying to protect the relationship. But withholding such information could lead to bigger issues down the line, especially if the wife finds out later and feels betrayed. \n\nAnother angle: the second child is a sibling to the first, so the author's continued donations could be seen as a follow-up to the first decision. Since he already discussed the first, not mentioning the second could be a mistake in transparency. The wife might feel that if he was okay with the first, the second is part of the same story. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to provoke her further, but keeping secrets in a marriage can erode trust. Even if the wife is being unkind, the author's duty is to be honest. So, not disclosing the second donation could be seen as in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that the wife's teasing is unreasonable, and the author is trying to protect himself. However, in a committed relationship, certain levels of honesty are expected regardless of the other's reactions. So the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's not being fully honest with his wife about a significant matter related to their relationship.\n"
