She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child he donated to the same woman. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a sperm donor in his 20s, told his wife about the first child, but now there's a second child from the same donation. The wife has been making jokes and teasing him about the first child, which is making him uncomfortable. He's decided not to tell her about the second one.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by not disclosing the second child? Let's break it down. \n\nMarital trust and honesty are important. The author didn't mention the second donation, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if the wife's reaction to the first was harsh, the author has a responsibility to communicate openly with his spouse about major life events, especially those that could impact their family. \n\nThe first disclosure was made, but the second wasn't. The second child is another significant factor. The author's reasoning is that the wife's teasing and jokes are uncomfortable, so he's withholding information. However, keeping a secret like this, especially about a second child, could lead to bigger issues. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter, and the author might be hiding something that could affect their family dynamics. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife uses the first child as a joke during fights, which isn't healthy. But that doesn't justify not being honest about the second child. The author's discomfort with her reaction is understandable, but the right thing is to communicate, even if it's difficult. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, depending on where they live, there might be legal obligations regarding donor children. Even if there aren't, ethically, the author should be upfront. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out later that he knew about the second child and didn't tell her. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent about the second child. Honesty is crucial in a marriage, even when the spouse's reaction is challenging. The author's decision to withhold information to avoid discomfort could lead to more significant issues down the line, and it's his responsibility to address the communication issues with his wife rather than hiding the truth.\n"
