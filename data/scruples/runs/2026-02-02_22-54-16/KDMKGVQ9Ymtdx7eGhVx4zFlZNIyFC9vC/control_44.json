She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author donated sperm as a 20-year-old student to a woman who wanted to be a single mom. They had a son, and the author told his wife about this after they started dating. The wife was initially understanding but later teased him and made jokes about it. Then, when the wife was pregnant with their daughter, the woman used the author's sperm again for a second child. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child because he found her reactions uncomfortable and feared more teasing. Now, he's unsure if he should come clean or not.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author was honest about the first donation but kept the second one secret. His wife's reactions were annoying, but does that justify not being fully transparent? \n\nMarriage usually requires honesty, especially about matters that could affect the family. The second child is a significant fact that could impact their daughter if they ever meet or if there are legal implications. The author's reason for not telling is fear of his wife's teasing, but that doesn't negate the need for disclosure. \n\nThe wife's behavior is not ideal\u2014teasing and making jokes is unkind and unfair. However, the author's responsibility is to be truthful. Hiding information, even if motivated by discomfort, can erode trust. The author might need to have a conversation to address his wife's behavior, but keeping the second child a secret is still a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, from a legal standpoint, in some places, being a sperm donor might have legal implications if the donor is not anonymous. If the second child is also his genetic child, there might be responsibilities he's avoiding by keeping it secret.\n\nSo, while the wife isn't in the right for her teasing, the author's secrecy about the second child is the main issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being fully honest with his wife about the second donation.\n"
