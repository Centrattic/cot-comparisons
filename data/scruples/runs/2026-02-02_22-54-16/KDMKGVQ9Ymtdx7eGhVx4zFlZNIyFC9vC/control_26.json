She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he donated sperm twice to a woman when he was younger, told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been making jokes and teasing him about the first one, which is making him uncomfortable. Now he's wondering if keeping the second child a secret is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When he donated sperm the first time, he told his wife. That's important because he didn't hide it initially. The wife's reaction has been problematic, making jokes and bringing it up during fights. The author is concerned that telling her about the second donation would make things worse. But is it ethical to not disclose this second time?\n\nMarital trust and transparency are key here. Even though the wife's behavior is annoying, the author is choosing not to share all the information. The second donation happens after they have their own child, so it's a significant event that affects the family dynamics. If the wife knew about the second child, maybe she'd have a reaction, but the author is avoiding potential conflict by not telling her. However, withholding such information could be seen as a breach of trust. He's not being completely honest with her, which might be the wrong choice.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife has a history of using the first donation as a weapon in arguments, the author might feel justified in protecting himself. But even so, in a marriage, honesty is usually considered important. The fact that he had another child from the same donor could have implications, like if there are medical reasons or if the wife would want to know for her own family planning. Also, if the wife discovers this later, it could cause bigger issues. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not being transparent, even if the wife's reactions are unkind.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions in donating sperm the second time without discussing it with his wife. Even if they were not married then, once they had a child together, any additional children from the donor would be part of their extended family. The author didn't seek her consent or even inform her, which is a problem. So the act of not telling her about the second donation is the main issue here. Even if the wife is difficult, the author has a responsibility to be honest with his spouse about such significant matters.\n"
