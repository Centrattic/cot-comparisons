She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and told his wife about it when they first met. The wife was initially understanding but started teasing him over time, even making jokes about incest after watching Game of Thrones. Then, the author donated sperm a second time without his wife's knowledge, and he's hiding this second child.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did he have a responsibility to disclose the second donation? The first time, he was honest, so the wife was aware. Now, the second time, he's being secretive. Marital relationships typically require transparency, especially when it comes to offspring. Even though the first child was already known, keeping a second one hidden might be a breach of trust. \n\nThe wife's reactions are problematic, but that doesn't justify keeping secrets. The author could have addressed her concerns or sought counseling instead of hiding more information. By not telling her about the second child, he's withholding information that could affect their marriage and family dynamics. \n\nAlso, the fact that he used a false pretense (visiting an old friend) to donate again might be another issue. If the wife had discovered this later, it could lead to bigger problems. So, while the wife's teasing is hurtful, the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence is a breach of trust. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
