She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. The author already told his wife about the first child, but she reacted badly and made jokes about it. Now, he didn't tell her about the second one.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about honesty and trust in a marriage. The author didn't disclose the second child, which could be seen as a lie or omission. But the wife's reaction to the first one was negative and teasing. The author might feel justified in not wanting to cause more conflict. However, withholding a significant fact like having another child might be considered dishonest, even if the wife was mean about the first.\n\nMarriage usually requires transparency, especially on issues that could affect the family. The fact that the wife's teasing is bothering him is understandable, but the second child is a new issue. The author's decision not to disclose could lead to betrayal if found out later. On the other hand, the wife's behavior in bringing up the first child during fights might be manipulative, but that doesn't excuse the author's secrecy.\n\nSo, the question is whether not telling the second time is wrong. If the first was already disclosed, the second is a continuation. Not telling could be seen as deceitful. Even if the wife was harsh, the author has a responsibility to be honest. The author's reasoning is based on fear of her reaction, but withholding such information might harm the marriage more in the long run. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n"
