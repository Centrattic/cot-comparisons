She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The story says he already had a first child via donation, which he told his wife about, but she started teasing him and making jokes. Now, after a second donation, he's keeping it secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered wrong here. The main issue is about honesty in a marriage. The user (author) didn't tell his wife about the second child because of her previous reactions. But is withholding this information unethical or wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing, making jokes, using it in fights. That's not a healthy way to handle the situation. The author might feel justified in not wanting to deal with that again. But on the other hand, marriage requires transparency. Not telling his wife about a second child could be seen as a lie, which might hurt the trust more in the long run.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent. The author's wife might have a right to know, especially if they have a daughter together and there's a possibility of future family issues (like the incest joke they mentioned). The author might be avoiding conflict, but hiding this could lead to bigger problems later if discovered another way.\n\nBut then again, the wife's behavior was inappropriate. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, the author might be protecting himself from emotional harm. The question is whether not disclosing the second child is a betrayal of trust or self-preservation.\n\nI think the key here is the context of the wife's behavior. If the author believes that telling her would lead to more harm than good, he might not be in the wrong. However, the act of not being honest about a significant family matter is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. It's a tough balance between protecting oneself from an unkind partner and maintaining marital honesty.\n\nIn the end, maybe the wrong isn't on the author's side because he's trying to prevent further conflict given her past reactions. But the ethical angle would argue that honesty is important regardless. Different perspectives here. I need to decide which angle is stronger. Given the wife's unkind behavior, the author's choice to not disclose could be seen as a reasonable self-defense, making him not in the wrong. But others might argue that honesty is always the right path, making him in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
