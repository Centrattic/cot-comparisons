She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a son with a single mother when he was 20 and told his wife about it when they first met. His wife was initially okay but later started teasing him and making jokes about the first child. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked for another donation, leading to a second child. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child because he was uncomfortable with her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are honesty in a marriage and the author's reasons for withholding information. The author did tell his wife about the first child, which is a significant commitment. However, when the second child came along, he decided not to disclose it. The wife's behavior (teasing, jokes, referencing Game of Thrones) is probably contributing to his decision. But in a marriage, transparency is usually expected, even if the topic is sensitive or the spouse's reaction is negative.\n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't want to cause more conflict. However, keeping a secret like having another child could be seen as a major omission. The second child is a direct result of the first situation, so the author is creating a second child without his wife's knowledge. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the author is withholding information that affects their family structure and future. The question is whether the wife has a right to know, regardless of how she might react.\n\nIn many relationships, honesty is considered crucial. The author's actions could lead to more issues down the line, like if the wife finds out later in a different way, which could cause more harm. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know. Also, the fact that the second donation happened under the guise of visiting an old college buddy suggests some level of deception, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife's behavior being unreasonable. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, the author might feel justified in not bringing up the second. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the right. The decision to keep a secret about another child is a significant ethical consideration. Even if the wife is being difficult, the author's responsibility to be truthful might take precedence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because not disclosing the second child is a serious omission, despite the wife's behavior. However, there's a counterargument that the wife's treatment of the first child's existence is also problematic, which complicates things. But in terms of marital honesty and transparency, not revealing the second child is a breach, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
