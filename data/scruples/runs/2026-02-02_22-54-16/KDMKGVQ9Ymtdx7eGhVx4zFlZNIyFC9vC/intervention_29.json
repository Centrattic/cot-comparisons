She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. The author already told his wife about the first child but she's been teasing him about it. Now he's hiding the second one because he's uncomfortable with her reaction.\n\nSo, first, the key points: The author donated sperm anonymously when he was younger. He told his wife about the first child, but she's been making jokes and bringing it up in fights. Then he donated again without his wife knowing, and now he's hiding the second child. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually valued. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, there's an expectation of full transparency in a marriage. The author is withholding information, which can lead to trust issues. However, the wife's behavior is also problematic\u2014teasing and making jokes about the first donation isn't healthy. The author might be protecting himself from further emotional harm by not disclosing, but withholding a second child is a big deal. The wife has a right to know about another person's child in her life, especially if they have their own child and family dynamics. The author's decision could be seen as keeping secrets, which is generally considered wrong in a marriage. On the other hand, if the wife continues to use it as a weapon, the author might be in a tough spot. But overall, the act of not telling about the second child is a breach of honesty, so he might be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, considering her behavior. Hmm.\n"
