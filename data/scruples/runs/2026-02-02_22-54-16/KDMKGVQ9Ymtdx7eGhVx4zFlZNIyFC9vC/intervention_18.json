She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. The situation is that he had already told her about the first child, but she was making jokes and teasing him about it. Now, he's hiding the second child to avoid further conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The wife's reaction to the first child was negative, using it as a joke or a weapon in arguments. That's a red flag for how she's handling the situation. The author's decision not to disclose the second child might be a protective measure against ongoing discomfort. But does that make him wrong?\n\nMarriage typically involves honesty and transparency. Hiding a second child could be seen as a lack of full disclosure, which might damage trust if found out later. However, the wife's behavior is also problematic. If she's using the first child as a joke, maybe she's not respecting his feelings, so the author might feel justified in protecting himself.\n\nThe key points are: Was the first disclosure sufficient? The author did tell her about the first child. The second child is a follow-up, but the wife's reaction made him uncomfortable. The author's silence could be seen as a way to avoid further conflict, but it's also withholding information about a significant matter.\n\nOn one hand, he's in a position where his wife isn't respecting his boundaries by teasing and bringing it up in fights. On the other hand, withholding such information might lead to betrayal if she finds out later. But the wife's behavior is clearly toxic here. The author might feel it's necessary to protect his own emotional well-being.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the second child is a material fact that he should disclose. Since the first was already known, the second is an extension. But considering the wife's reaction, the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing his mental health. However, some might argue that honesty is always the best policy. The balance between protecting oneself and being truthful is tricky here.\n"
