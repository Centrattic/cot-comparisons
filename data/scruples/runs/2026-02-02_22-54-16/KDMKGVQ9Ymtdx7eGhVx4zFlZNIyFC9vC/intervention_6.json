She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author became a sperm donor when he was younger, and he told his wife about the first child. But his wife has been making jokes and teasing him about it, which is making him uncomfortable. Then, he donated sperm a second time without telling his wife, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage. Honesty is usually considered important in relationships. The author didn't inform his wife about the second child, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But wait, he had already told her about the first child. When she reacted poorly and continued to make jokes, he decided not to tell her about the second one. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that since his wife was already uncomfortable with the first child, bringing up the second one would cause more conflict. He might not want to escalate the situation. On the other hand, not telling her means he's hiding a part of his past, which could be seen as dishonest. Even if the wife was teasing, the author might still be responsible to share important information, especially if it affects their family dynamics in the future.\n\nAlso, the second donation happened after the author and his wife had their own child. If the existence of the second donor child could have implications for their daughter, like potential half-siblings or other family matters, then the author's decision not to disclose might have consequences. The wife might have a right to know, especially if there are health or legal aspects to consider.\n\nBut the author argues that the wife's reactions are hurtful and that he doesn't want to provoke her further. However, withholding such information could lead to bigger issues down the line if she finds out in another way. The key here is whether the author's non-disclosure is a reasonable choice given the context of his wife's behavior versus a betrayal of trust.\n\nI think there's a balance between protecting oneself from emotional harm and maintaining transparency in the relationship. While the author's wife's teasing is problematic, the author still has a responsibility to be honest. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not telling her about the second child, even if the wife's reactions are difficult. The right approach might have been to set boundaries with the wife about her teasing rather than withholding information.\n"
