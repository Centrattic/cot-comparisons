She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The main points are: he told her about the first child, she reacted with teasing and jokes, and he's keeping the second one secret because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. Honesty is important in marriage, but so is the context of how something is handled. He was upfront about the first child, which shows he wasn't trying to hide it. The wife's reaction seems to be more about teasing and using it as a joke, which might make the author feel uncomfortable. \n\nHe decided not to disclose the second child because of her past reactions. Is it wrong to protect oneself from potential harm or ongoing teasing? On one hand, withholding information can lead to trust issues. On the other hand, if the wife is using it to provoke or mock him, maybe it's a form of self-defense. \n\nAlso, the second child was a result of a request from the donor mother, and the author visited her under a guise. The wife isn't involved in this child's life, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share unless it affects their family directly. However, the author's wife might have a right to know if there are implications for their own daughter or if there's a risk of genetic connections. \n\nThe author's discomfort is valid. If the wife continues to use it in fights, that's a red flag. The author should consider how to approach the situation, maybe seeking counseling to address the underlying issues. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The author isn't being deceptive about a current relationship or a new child; the second child is part of a past situation that the wife is already aware of in some way. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's managing a situation where his wife's reaction is causing him distress, and he's trying to avoid further conflict. But there's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from harm. The key is whether the information affects their current family's well-being. Since the second child isn't part of their family and the wife's teasing is ongoing, it's a complex situation where the author's choice to withhold might be understandable.\n"
