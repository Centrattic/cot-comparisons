She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, after she was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started making jokes and teasing him, even bringing it up during fights. Now, the author kept the second child a secret because of her reactions. The question is whether that makes him wrong.\n\nHmm. So, in terms of marital trust, honesty is usually a big factor. But the wife's reaction is problematic. She's using the situation to tease and mock him, which is unkind. The author might feel that revealing the second child would only make things worse, especially if she's already using the first one to provoke him.\n\nHowever, not telling her about the second child could be seen as deceptive. Even if the wife's response is negative, the author is withholding information that might be significant, especially if they have a daughter and there could be future implications. But the author's main reason is to avoid further conflict and emotional distress, which is understandable.\n\nOn one hand, marriage often requires transparency. On the other, the wife's behavior is creating a hostile environment. The author might be protecting himself and trying to maintain peace. But is lying or withholding information ever justified? It depends on the context. If the wife is using the information to harass him, maybe he has a valid reason to not share more.\n\nBut legally and ethically, in most cases, partners should be honest with each other about such matters, especially if there could be future implications for their own children or family dynamics. The author might be prioritizing his mental well-being, but the wife has a right to know about other children from the same situation. So there's a conflict between personal boundaries and marital honesty.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the wife's response is toxic, and the author is trying to protect himself from her behavior. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, and given the context of her teasing and using it against him, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for withholding the second child's existence.\n"
