She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation after she reacted poorly to the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20, had a child, and told his wife a year later. She was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes. Then, during his wife's pregnancy, he donated again to the same woman, resulting in a second child. He's kept this secret because of her previous reaction.\n\nNow, considering relationships and trust, honesty is usually important. But there's also the aspect of the wife's behavior\u2014she's been using the situation to tease and joke, which is hurtful. The author might feel that revealing the second child would only escalate the tension. However, by not disclosing, he's hiding information that could affect their lives, especially if the children ever come into their lives or if there are legal/financial implications.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision to withhold the second donation could be seen as a way to protect himself from further conflict. But in a relationship, transparency is key. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter, especially if there's a chance of legal responsibilities or if the children might meet in the future. Also, the author might be avoiding confrontation, which isn't healthy in the long run.\n\nBut the wife's reaction is problematic too. Her jokes and teasing are inappropriate and disrespectful, which complicates the situation. The author might feel justified in not sharing more if he believes she can't handle it constructively. However, keeping secrets can erode trust over time.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, given the context of his wife's behavior. He's trying to navigate a difficult situation to avoid further conflict. But there's a case to be made that full disclosure is necessary for the relationship's health, even if it's uncomfortable. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are a reasonable self-preservation or a breach of trust.\n"
