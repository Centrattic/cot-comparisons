She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was 20 when he donated sperm to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child, but when she started teasing him about it, he decided not to mention the second child. The wife's reactions include making jokes and bringing it up during arguments, which clearly upsets the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty in a marriage. Typically, transparency is important in relationships, especially when it comes to matters that could affect the family. However, there's a nuance here. The author didn't have a sexual relationship with the woman, just a professional sperm donation. He was honest about the first child but chose not to disclose the second due to his wife's negative reactions.\n\nBut wait, the second child was born after their own daughter. The author might be worried about potential issues if the wife found out later, maybe through other means. However, by not telling her, he's keeping a secret that could have implications. For example, if the children ever meet or if there's a need for medical history information. Also, the wife's teasing suggests that she's using it as a point of contention, which is not healthy for the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision might stem from a desire to avoid conflict. If the wife's reactions are hurtful and frequent, maybe he's trying to protect the relationship. But withholding such information could lead to bigger issues down the line, especially if the wife discovers the truth in a different way, which might feel like a betrayal.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility. Since he's the biological father of two children from a non-partner, even though it was a one-time arrangement, there might be ongoing responsibilities. However, he's not involved in their upbringing, so maybe that's a different aspect.\n\nIn many relationships, major life decisions and secrets are expected to be shared. Sperm donation, especially twice, is a significant matter. The fact that the wife was initially understanding but then became critical adds complexity. The author is caught between honesty and protecting himself from emotional distress.\n\nBut is it wrong to withhold information if sharing it causes harm? That's a tricky ethical question. Some might argue that full honesty is always the right approach, while others might see the author's actions as a form of self-preservation to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nI think the key here is whether the second donation is a separate act that needs to be disclosed, especially since it happened after the first one. The author had already told her about the first child, but the second is a follow-up. Not telling her could be seen as deceitful, even if the initial intent was good. The wife has a right to know about all biological children of her spouse, particularly if there's a possibility of future interactions or if it's relevant to their own family dynamics.\n\nMoreover, the wife's teasing and bringing it up in arguments is a red flag. It's not just about the information itself but how it's being used. If the wife is using it to provoke, that's an issue in the relationship that needs addressing, not just the act of keeping the secret.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be to avoid conflict, withholding such information could be seen as dishonest. The right approach might be to have an open conversation about the impact of her teasing and the reasons for not disclosing the second child, even if it's uncomfortable. However, whether that makes the author \"in the wrong\" depends on the cultural or relational expectations, but generally, transparency is valued in such matters.\n"
