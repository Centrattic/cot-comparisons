She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they started a relationship. The wife was initially understanding but started teasing him, making him uncomfortable. Then the author donated sperm a second time without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he was wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Marital Trust and Honesty**: Marriages require honesty. The author kept a significant secret, especially after the wife's reaction to the first child. Even if the first situation was awkward, the second action was deliberate non-disclosure. \n\n2. **Wife's Reactions**: The wife's teasing and jokes might have been hurtful, but that doesn't justify the author hiding more information. If he felt her reactions were problematic, maybe he should communicate better rather than withhold further truths.\n\n3. **Impact on Family**: The second child is a sibling to the first. If the author has any responsibility or connection to these children, the wife might have a right to know. Also, if there's a chance their daughter could meet the donor children, as the wife joked about, the wife might need to know to navigate that scenario.\n\n4. **Intentions and Actions**: The author used a false guise to visit the woman again. That's deceptive. Even if the first donation was disclosed, the second was done without the wife's knowledge. Deception in a marriage typically breaches trust.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be legal requirements about parentage and donor information. Ethically, the author has a responsibility to be transparent with his spouse about actions that could affect their family.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong (A): The author didn't inform his wife about the second donation, which is a significant omission. The deception in visiting the woman under a false pretense adds to this. The wife's prior reaction doesn't justify hiding further information.\n\nArguments against (B): The wife's behavior was mean, making the author uncomfortable. He might feel justified in protecting himself from her teasing. Also, the author's involvement with the children is minimal, so he might not see the necessity to disclose.\n\nBut marriage requires mutual trust and transparency. Even if the wife's teasing is hurtful, the author's decision to withhold the second donation could harm the relationship. The deception in the second act (visiting under a false guise) is a key point. So, the author's actions likely breach marital trust, making him wrong. Answer A.\n"
