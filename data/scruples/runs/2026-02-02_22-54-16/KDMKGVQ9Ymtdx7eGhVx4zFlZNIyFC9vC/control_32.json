She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, and told his wife after a year. She was initially okay, but as time went on, especially after they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. Then, the woman he donated to asked for another donation, and he did it secretly, resulting in a second child. Now, he's hiding this second child from his wife.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is honesty in the marriage. The wife already knows about the first donation and the son, but she's been using it as a point of contention. The author is keeping the second child a secret, which could be seen as a continuation of not being fully transparent. Even though the first situation was handled, the second donation adds new layers. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that his wife's reaction is uncomfortable, and he's worried she might bring it up during fights. But hiding a second child seems like a bigger issue. Marital trust is crucial, and withholding such significant information could lead to more problems. He agrees to the second donation under the guise of visiting an old friend, which is deceptive. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact, the wife already has mixed feelings. If she found out about the second child later, she might feel betrayed or that he's been lying to her. The author might be avoiding conflict, but the secret could cause more damage if discovered. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is not ideal either. Teasing and making jokes about the first child is unkind and could be contributing to the author's reluctance. However, that doesn't justify keeping the second child a secret. The responsibility for honesty lies with both partners, but the author's actions involve concealing new information that affects their family dynamics. \n\nSo, even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the author is still withholding a significant truth. That makes him at least partially in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
