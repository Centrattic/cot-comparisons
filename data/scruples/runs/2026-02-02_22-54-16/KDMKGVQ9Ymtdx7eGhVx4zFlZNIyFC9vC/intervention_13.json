She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was a sperm donor twice. The first time, he told his wife, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes about it, especially referencing Game of Thrones and their daughter. The second time, he didn't tell his wife because he was uncomfortable with her reactions. Now, he's wondering if he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author donated sperm to a woman who wanted to be a single mother. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife's reactions became uncomfortable, involving teasing and jokes. The author chose not to disclose the second child to avoid further conflict or discomfort.\n\nIs there a moral or ethical obligation to tell the spouse about the second child? Well, marriage typically involves transparency and honesty, especially regarding matters that could affect family dynamics. However, the author's wife already reacted negatively to the first child, making it a sensitive issue. The second child is a continuation of the same situation, so the author is worried about escalating the problem.\n\nBut withholding information can lead to trust issues. If the author didn't tell her about the second child, is that a betrayal of trust? On the other hand, if the wife was using the first child as a way to tease and provoke, maybe the author felt justified in protecting himself from that.\n\nAnother angle: the second child is legally and genetically his. If the wife were to find out later, would that cause more harm than good? The author might be avoiding conflict, but not telling could lead to a bigger issue if discovered. However, the wife's behavior seems to be more about teasing and emotional manipulation rather than genuine concern or respect for the situation.\n\nLegally, in some places, there might be requirements about notifying a spouse about genetic children, but I'm not sure about the specifics. The question is more about moral wrongdoing. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to protect his mental well-being and the marriage, but he also has a duty to his wife to be honest, especially if there are implications for their family.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction seems to be more about using the situation as a weapon in their relationship rather than a genuine need for information. The author's decision could be seen as a way to maintain peace and avoid unnecessary conflict. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife has a right to know about her husband's genetic children, that complicates things.\n\nI think the key is whether the author's actions were malicious or done in bad faith. If he's keeping it secret to avoid her manipulative teasing, then it's more about self-preservation. But if there are other factors, like the children needing to know about their biological father or potential family connections, that might change the picture. However, the scenario doesn't mention those aspects.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the wife's behavior was problematic, and he's trying to protect the relationship. But there's also a case for the importance of full disclosure in a marriage. However, given the context, the author's decision could be justified as a way to prevent ongoing conflict and emotional harm.\n"
