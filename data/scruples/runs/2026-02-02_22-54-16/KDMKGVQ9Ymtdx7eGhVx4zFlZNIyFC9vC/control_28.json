She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him about it, making jokes, and bringing it up during arguments. He then had a second child with the same woman without telling his wife. Now he's conflicted about whether to disclose.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he have an obligation to tell his wife about the second child? Was hiding the second donation wrong? Let's consider the relationships and commitments. The author and his wife have their own daughter, so their relationship is presumably monogamous and committed. The fact that he continued to donate sperm to another woman without his wife's knowledge could be a breach of trust. Even if the first time was disclosed, the second time might be seen as a secret he should have shared, especially since he knows his wife's reaction might be negative. \n\nBut wait, the wife was already upset with the first child. The author might be avoiding conflict by not telling her. However, keeping a secret about a second child, which is a significant matter, could be seen as dishonest. In a committed relationship, transparency is usually expected, especially regarding things that could impact the family structure or future decisions. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be teased or have it used against him, but withholding such information can damage trust. \n\nAnother angle: The fact that the author had a second donation after the wife was already aware of the first one might imply that he continued without considering her feelings or their relationship's boundaries. Even if the first was disclosed, the second might require a mutual decision, especially if there are implications for their family. The author's wife's behavior might be immature, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility to be honest. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to visit the woman under a false pretense (as an old college buddy) shows a lack of transparency from the start. He might be justifying the secrecy because of his wife's reaction, but that doesn't excuse not being honest about the second child. Ultimately, relationships require both parties to communicate openly, even about difficult topics. By not sharing the second child, the author is keeping a significant secret, which is generally considered wrong in a marriage. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
