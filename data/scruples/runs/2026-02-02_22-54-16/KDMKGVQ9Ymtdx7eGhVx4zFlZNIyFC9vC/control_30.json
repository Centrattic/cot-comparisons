She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife about it when they first met a year later. Initially, his wife was understanding, but over time, especially as they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. She even made jokes about the kids possibly marrying and having a Joffrey-like child, referencing Game of Thrones. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the original woman asked him to donate again to give her son a sibling. He did this secretly, under the guise of visiting an old friend, and didn't tell his wife about the second child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child. \n\nFirst, let's consider the key elements. The author did disclose the first donation. However, the wife's reaction was negative and teasing, which made him uncomfortable. He decided not to mention the second donation because of her previous behavior. But is that justifiable?\n\nMarital relationships typically require honesty and transparency, especially regarding decisions that could impact the family. The second child is another person who exists, and the wife might have a right to know about this, as it could affect their family dynamics, possibly in terms of financial responsibilities, emotional impact, or future situations. The author didn't consider that not disclosing the second child could lead to more issues if the wife found out later, which might be worse than the current situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used a \"guise\" to visit the woman (pretending it was an old friend) suggests deception. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh initially, the author's decision to hide the second child might be seen as a lack of full commitment to the marriage's honesty. The wife might have a right to be involved in such decisions, especially after the first incident.\n\nBut then, the author's reasoning is that the wife's teasing and jokes were hurtful, making him feel uncomfortable. He's trying to avoid further conflict. However, withholding such information can lead to a breakdown in trust, which is a critical part of any marriage. Even if the wife's teasing is problematic, the author's silence on the second donation might not be the right approach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author didn't have any malicious intent in the initial donation, the subsequent actions (hiding the second child) could be seen as deceptive. The wife's reaction might be unreasonable, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of the responsibility to be truthful in the marriage. The decision to not disclose could be considered a breach of trust, even if the wife's behavior was difficult.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child, even if the wife's teasing is a problem. Honesty is a fundamental aspect of a marriage, and withholding information that affects family life could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
