She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a child with her, and told his wife about it. His wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes about it. Then, after their own daughter was born, he donated sperm again to the same woman for a second child, and he hasn't told his wife about this second donation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of his actions. When he first donated, he told his wife. That seems responsible. But when the woman asked for another donation, he went ahead without telling his wife. The key here is whether he has an obligation to inform his wife about the second child. \n\nHis wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing and using it in fights. The author is worried that telling her about the second child would escalate the situation. But even if she's been difficult about it, is it right to withhold such information? The second child is another person's life, and the wife might have a right to know, especially if there could be future implications, like family dynamics or if the children ever meet the author's family.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the second donation happened under the guise of visiting an old friend. That part is a bit sneaky. Even if the wife is being a bit harsh, the author's decision to hide the second donation might be seen as dishonest. Trust is important in a marriage, and withholding such significant information could be a breach of trust, regardless of the wife's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the family. If the wife finds out later, it might cause more hurt and betrayal. Even if the author is uncomfortable, transparency is usually valued in relationships. The author might be justified in feeling hurt by his wife's jokes, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right to keep secrets.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author's decision to not inform his wife about the second child could be seen as wrong because it's a matter of honesty and transparency in the relationship. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, the author has a responsibility to be truthful about significant aspects of his past, especially those that could affect their family.\n"
