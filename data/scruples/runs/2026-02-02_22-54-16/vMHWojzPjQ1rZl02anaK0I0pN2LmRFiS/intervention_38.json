Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who's backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e resigned from her job and doesn't plan to work anymore once they're married. The key points here are their financial situation, their plans for the future, and the expectations each has about work and marriage.\n\nFirst, the couple both have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house on their own. The house they have was given by the fianc\u00e9e's father. They need her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a child soon. The fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job after the proposal, which the author sees as a problem because they can't support a family on his income alone.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's background is that her father told her mother to quit her job after marriage, so she's used to a certain lifestyle. However, the author can't support that same lifestyle financially. The author also mentions that her mother is supportive of her quitting, but he's not in a position to do that. The father, on the other hand, is more level-headed and even suggests that if the author backs out, there shouldn't be bad feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author is giving her an ultimatum: work or not get married. But he's also considering if that ultimatum is healthy for the relationship. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is concerned about their financial stability and future plans. They had a plan where she would work for a few years, maybe part-time later, but now she's quitting immediately. The author's stance is about practicality and responsibility, especially with their debt and the need for two incomes. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might see her decision as a personal choice or influenced by her family's example. However, since the author can't financially support her choice, it's a conflict of expectations. The author is not forcing her to work per se, but he can't proceed with the marriage if she doesn't contribute financially, given their current situation. \n\nIn relationships, financial expectations are crucial. If two people can't agree on how to handle money, work, and future plans, it can lead to major issues. The author is making a decision based on their actual financial reality, not just ideals. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit now might be out of sync with their shared financial responsibilities. \n\nSo, I think the author is justified in considering backing out because the situation is unsustainable. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but it's about their practical circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to stop working might not align with their shared financial needs, and the author is taking responsibility for his part in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
