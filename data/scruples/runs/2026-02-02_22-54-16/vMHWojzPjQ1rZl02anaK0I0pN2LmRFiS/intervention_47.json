Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been together for 3.5 years. Both have significant student debt, and the house they live in was given to her by her father. They proposed, but then she quit her job, which the author didn't expect. They had plans for her to work part-time later when they have a kid, but she now wants to stop working entirely. The author feels they need her income to survive, especially with future kids and debt. The fianc\u00e9e's mom is supportive, but her dad is more level-headed and acknowledges the financial reality.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, shared expectations for the future, and mutual agreement on life plans. The engagement was supposed to be a partnership, but if one partner's decision to stop working creates financial strain, that's a problem. The author is standing up for his needs, which is understandable. He's not being unreasonable by wanting to avoid financial pressure. Her decision to quit without discussing it more thoroughly could be a breach of trust or lack of communication. The author's stance is about financial stability and not wanting to rely solely on his income, which isn't feasible given their current situation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of her past decisions, like choosing a local college due to a boyfriend, leading to student debt. While that's in the past, it's contributing to their current financial burden. The author is realistic about their financial situation and the need for both incomes. The fianc\u00e9e's plan to stop working now, without a feasible financial backup, might be selfish or unrealistic. The father's advice to the author to back out if necessary shows that the author isn't in the wrong here. \n\nUltimately, the engagement requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to compromise and their financial plans are incompatible, the author is justified in backing out. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
