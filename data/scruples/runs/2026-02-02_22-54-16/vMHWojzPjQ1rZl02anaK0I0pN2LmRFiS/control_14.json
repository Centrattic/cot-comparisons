Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job after marriage.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple has been dating for 3.5 years, both have significant student loan debt. The woman's father is wealthy, gave them a house. The man proposed two months ago. The woman then quits her job, saying she wants to be a stay-at-home wife. The man is upset because they can't afford it. They had a plan to have her work until the kid starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal. Now he's considering backing out of the engagement unless she agrees to work.\n\nSo the user is asking if he's in the wrong for doing that. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the woman is changing her mind about work after the proposal. Maybe she thought she wanted a different lifestyle. On the other hand, financial stability is a big concern here. They both have debt, and her income is needed. Also, the father in-law's perspective is that the man shouldn't have to support the family if he's not financially ready. The father is supportive of backing out.\n\nBut the core issue is about expectations. They had a plan that she would work until the kid starts school, but she's changing that. Is it fair for him to back out now? He's not in a position to support a family without her income. The woman might feel that marriage is about partnership, and expecting her to work is adding to the pressure. However, the man isn't in a wealthy position like her father, so he's realistic about his ability to support them.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if they had discussed their plans and she agreed to work until a certain point, then changing her mind might not be acceptable. But maybe they didn't have that conversation clearly. The man might be acting in his own financial interest, which is valid. However, making an ultimatum before the wedding could be seen as inconsiderate. But given their financial situation, he's justified in not wanting to take on more debt without her income.\n\nThe woman's choice to go to a local state school because of her boyfriend instead of a \"real school\" where her father would have paid might add to the man's frustration, as it's an example of her not planning for her future financially. Also, she has no student loan debt if she had gone to another school, which might have made things easier.\n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? If he backs out because he can't financially support the family without her income, then he's acting in his own self-interest. But marriage requires compromise. If she changed her mind after the proposal, maybe she's not compromising. However, the man is right to consider his financial limits. The father is supportive of him backing out, which suggests it's a reasonable stance.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's making a decision based on financial realities. The fianc\u00e9e changed her plans without considering their financial situation, and the man has the right to set boundaries. The father even supports his decision, so it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
