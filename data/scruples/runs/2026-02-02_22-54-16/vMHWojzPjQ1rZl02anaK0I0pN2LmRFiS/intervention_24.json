Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 28, fianc\u00e9e is 26. They both have student debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's gift. She quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, inspired by her father's example. But the author can't support them both financially, especially with plans for a kid. He's not in a position to support a family without her income. They had a plan that she would work part-time after pre-K, but now she wants to quit immediately. Her parents are divided; her dad is more supportive of the author's stance.\n\nSo, the main issue here is financial stability. The author is concerned about their combined financial situation, which includes student loans and existing debts. If she quits her job, they might not be able to handle expenses, especially with a child on the horizon. Daycare is expensive, and without her income, it's a real problem. The author is not in the same financial position as her father, so he can't support a family solely on his income. \n\nHer decision to quit might be based on her family's wealth and her father's example, but the author isn't as financially secure. He's trying to be responsible here. The engagement was supposed to be a partnership, and now she's making a unilateral decision that affects both of them. The author is standing up for their combined financial future, which makes sense. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's motivation to quit is understandable\u2014maybe she wants to have a family and be a homemaker. But if that's a non-negotiable for her and not feasible financially, then there's a conflict. The author is trying to communicate that this isn't possible for them, which is reasonable. \n\nHer past choices, like going to a local school for her boyfriend, add context, but the author isn't blaming her for that. He's focusing on the present situation. Her mom supporting her decision adds pressure. But the author is trying to find a solution that's sustainable. \n\nAn ultimatum is tough, but if he's setting boundaries for their financial reality, it's a necessary step. Backing out of the engagement is a hard decision, but if he can't support them both and she's refusing to work, then walking away might be the responsible choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's considering their financial situation and the practical aspects of marriage. Her decision is based on her family's values, but they have different circumstances. The author is prioritizing their future and not forcing himself into a commitment he can't support.\n"
