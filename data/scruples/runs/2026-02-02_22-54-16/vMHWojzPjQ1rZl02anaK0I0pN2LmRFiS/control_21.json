Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThe author is a 28-year-old who's been in a 3.5-year relationship with a 26-year-old fianc\u00e9e. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e quit her job because she wants to be a stay-at-home wife after they get married. The problem is that their combined finances are tight, especially with student loans and credit card debt. The author feels like they can't support a family on his income alone, and they had a previous plan where she would work part-time after having a kid. Now, she's quitting her job immediately after the proposal, which the author isn't okay with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability. They both have significant debt and can't afford to lose her income. If she quits, it might be impossible to manage their current expenses, let alone have a child. The author's argument is practical: they need her income to survive. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e grew up with a wealthy father who told her mother to quit her job after marriage. She might have expected a similar situation, where her husband (the author) would support her financially. However, he's not in the same financial position as her father.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be influenced by her family's example, but the author isn't wealthy enough to support a family without her income. The author is also frustrated because she's adding to the financial burden with her student loans and chose a less expensive school out of love for a previous partner. The author feels betrayed because they had a plan for her to return to work after having a child, but she's changed her mind now that they're engaged.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum. They don't want to marry someone who doesn't plan to work, but they also don't want to force her by making it an ultimatum. They're in a tough spot because they need her income, but she's expecting to stay home.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether they're justified in backing out. From a financial perspective, it's reasonable for the author to be concerned about their ability to support a family without her income. Marrying someone who isn't contributing financially when it's necessary could lead to major stress. However, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her decision is about wanting to be a homemaker, which is a personal choice.\n\nBut the author isn't in a position to support her financially, so insisting that she doesn't work might not be feasible. The fianc\u00e9e's family's example might have led her to believe that staying home is viable, but that's not the case here. The author is trying to be realistic about their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e changing her mind after the proposal could be seen as breaking an unspoken agreement they had about working part-time after a child. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't forcing her to not work; they're pointing out the financial reality. They're not in the wrong for wanting to marry someone who is financially responsible. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit might be impractical given their situation. So, the author is not in the wrong for backing out. The answer is B.\n"
