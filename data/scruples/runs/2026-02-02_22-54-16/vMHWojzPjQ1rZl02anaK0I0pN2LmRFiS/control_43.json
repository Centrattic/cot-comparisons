Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she won't work once they get married. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple has been dating for 3.5 years, both have significant student debt, and they live in a house given by her wealthy father. The fianc\u00e9e is quitting her job because she wants to be a homemaker, inspired by her mother's example. The author is concerned about their financial stability without her income, especially planning to have a child. The father supports the author's decision to back out if needed.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, personal choices, and relationship dynamics. The author isn't in a position to support a family alone, and the fianc\u00e9e's decision changes their financial plan. They had previously agreed on a plan where she'd take a break after having a child and then return to work part-time. Now she's changing her mind, which impacts their future.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or no marriage. The question is whether he's wrong to do so. \n\nFrom one angle, the author has valid concerns about their financial future. They need both incomes to manage debt and future expenses. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit could lead to economic strain. Also, she has student loans from a school choice influenced by her relationship, which adds to the debt. The author is trying to be responsible, and the father even supports backing out if necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is making a personal choice about her role as a spouse. It's her right to decide her career path, even if it's different from the author's expectations. The author is now imposing a condition on the marriage, which could be seen as pressuring her to work, which might not be fair if she's genuinely not interested.\n\nBut looking at the situation, the author isn't just rejecting her for wanting not to work; he's recognizing that their financial plans are infeasible. They had a previous agreement that's now being changed. The father's support suggests that the community might see the author's decision as reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's mother's support adds to the pressure on the author.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is prioritizing financial stability and honesty about their circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to not work now without prior agreement could lead to problems down the line. The author is trying to avoid a marriage that might be unsustainable financially.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. He's making a responsible choice based on their shared financial reality. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
