Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a man who's engaged to a woman who just quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker. The key issue is whether he's at fault for backing out of the engagement because she's not willing to work anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial stability. They both have significant student loan and credit card debt, and their house was given by her father. If she quits her job, they might not have enough income to support a family, especially when planning to have a kid in a year. He argues that they had a plan for her to work part-time later, but she's now changing her mind.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit is influenced by her father's past behavior\u2014her dad made her mom quit her job when he proposed. She might feel that it's part of the traditional role or something she's expected, or maybe she wants to focus on family. Her mother is supportive, which adds another layer. The father here seems more reasonable, as he's advising the author to not proceed if he can't support her financially.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, is it reasonable for him to expect her to work? Financial stability is a big factor. They have debts and need her income. If she quits, it's a significant change in their financial plan. But he also needs to consider her personal choice. Maybe she's made a valid decision based on her values, like wanting to be a stay-at-home mom. However, he might not be in a financial position to support her choice, especially without a backup plan.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, relationships should be based on mutual understanding. They had a prior agreement about her working part-time later, but she's changing that now after the proposal. He's justified in needing her income. But is he being unfair by not accepting her choice? Or is she being selfish by not considering the financial reality?\n\nThe father's advice is key here. He supports the author's stance if he's not financially capable. That adds weight to the author's side. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's own debt being manageable if she went to a different school complicates things, but that's in the past.\n\nThe author isn't at fault for having financial concerns. He's standing his ground because their financial future is at risk. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering their prior plan might be the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out. Choosing B.\n"
