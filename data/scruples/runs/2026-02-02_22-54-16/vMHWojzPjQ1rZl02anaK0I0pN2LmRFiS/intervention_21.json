Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e are both in their late 20s, have been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student debt. She got a house from her father, which they couldn't afford on their own. The author proposed two months ago, but now she's quitting her job because she wants to be a stay-at-home wife, inspired by her mother's example. He argues that they need her income to support their future, especially if they have a child. He's questioning why she took out loans for a school she didn't want to attend just because of a boy. They had a plan for her to take a break when they had a kid but return later. Now she's changing her mind, and her mom supports her, but her dad is more level-headed.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He doesn't want to force her but feels it's necessary for their financial stability. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the factors. The author is concerned about financial responsibility. They have significant debt and need her income. Her decision to quit without prior agreement is causing a conflict. The author is not wanting to force her, but he's standing his ground on this issue because it's a major life decision. \n\nIs it fair for him to expect her to work? Well, marriage involves mutual agreement on major life decisions. If she changed her stance without discussion, that's a problem. But maybe she thought it was the right time. However, the author's financial situation is a valid concern. He's not trying to control her, but to have a sustainable future. \n\nHer reasons: her father's example, her mother's fairy tale, but she's different from her father in financial status. The author can't support a family alone. Her decision to take out loans for a school she wasn't interested in shows possible impulsive decisions, which could affect their trust.\n\nThe author is not forcing her to work, but setting a boundary that's necessary for their future. If he backs out, he's making a decision based on his inability to support them both. The father-in-law even supports the idea that he shouldn't be in that position unless he can financially support it.\n\nSo, the author's position is about financial responsibility and planning for the future. The fianc\u00e9e changed her plans without agreement, which disrupts their prior understanding. Therefore, the author isn't wrong in standing his ground. He's making a tough choice based on their circumstances. The answer would be B (No).\n"
