Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e, who then quit her job, saying she's happy to be a wife and not work anymore. The main points of conflict are financial responsibility, differing expectations about marriage roles, and the fianc\u00e9e's debt.\n\nFirst, the author is 28, the fianc\u00e9e is 26. Both have significant student loans and can't afford a house without her father's help. The fianc\u00e9e's father was wealthy and made her mother quit her job after marriage. Now she's following a similar path. The author values independence and doesn't want to rely on her father's support, especially since they need both incomes to have a kid. The fianc\u00e9e's plan is to never work again after the engagement, which the author finds unsustainable. They had a previous plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts school, but she abandoned that.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or don't get married. They're conflicted because they don't want the marriage to be based on an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e's mother supports her decision, but the father is more level-headed and even told the author to back out if needed.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is concerned about their financial future and the burden of debt. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision to quit her job could be seen as not considering the author's financial situation. The author's desire for a sustainable plan is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e seems to have expectations shaped by her parents' example, which may not be feasible for their current situation. The author isn't in a position to support a family alone, so expecting the spouse to contribute is logical. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, and I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nThe key here is the fianc\u00e9e's commitment to not working, which directly impacts their financial stability. The author has a valid reason to be concerned. The fianc\u00e9e's past choice of a less expensive college, leading to debt, might not be the author's fault, but it's a part of their shared financial burden. The author's ultimatum is based on real-life practicalities, not just personal preference. The fianc\u00e9e's mother's support could indicate she's not the only one with unrealistic expectations. The father's advice to the author to back out if necessary shows he's aware of the financial implications, which aligns with the author's reasoning.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e made a decision that conflicts with their agreed-upon plan and financial needs. The author is acting in their best interest and the couple's future. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
