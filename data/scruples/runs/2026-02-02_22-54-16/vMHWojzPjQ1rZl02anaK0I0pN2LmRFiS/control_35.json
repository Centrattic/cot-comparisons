Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she then quits her job because she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married. They both have a lot of student debt and can't afford to live without her income. The author is now considering backing out of the engagement because he can't support them both financially, especially if they have a kid soon. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy but her mom expected her to quit her job after marriage, which is similar to what he did for his wife. The author is conflicted because he respects her father's belief in self-reliance but isn't in a position to support a family on his own income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability. If they get married and she stops working, they might struggle with debt and expenses, especially with a child. That's a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that marriage should allow her to prioritize family, and she might have planned this based on her family's example. But her decision to quit suddenly without discussing it in depth could have been a mistake. The author is now facing a situation where he can't proceed with the marriage under those terms, which makes sense because financial stress can ruin a marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. If he feels that their financial plans are incompatible and that her decision to quit her job undermines their ability to support a family, then his decision to end the engagement isn't necessarily wrong. He's taking responsibility for their future and prioritizing financial stability, which is a reasonable consideration for marriage. However, some might argue that he could have addressed this during the engagement period, which is meant for working out such issues. The fact that he's seeking advice suggests he's trying to be fair and not just making a rash decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might have thought that marriage would allow her to step back from work, similar to her mother's situation. But her father's financial support isn't something they can rely on, and the author isn't in the same position as her father. The author's concern is valid because they can't afford to live without her income. It's also important to consider that her decision to take on student debt for a less expensive school might have impacted their financial situation, but that's in the past.\n\nIn terms of ultimatums, the author is considering giving her an ultimatum to work or not get married. While ultimatums can be harsh, in this context, it's about financial viability. However, using an ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach, but the author is also concerned that backing out now is the right choice for their future.\n\nSo weighing all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to back out because his financial concerns are legitimate. Marriage requires compatibility in major life decisions, and if one partner's choices create significant financial strain, it's reasonable to reconsider the marriage. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
