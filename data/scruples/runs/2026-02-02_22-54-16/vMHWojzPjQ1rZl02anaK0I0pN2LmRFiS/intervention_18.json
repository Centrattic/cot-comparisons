Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person writing the question (the author) is engaged to a woman who has decided to quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker once they're married. The author is upset because they can't afford to live on his income alone, especially considering they have student loans and credit card debt. They had a plan that she would work part-time once they have a kid, but now she's changed her mind and wants to stop working entirely after engagement. The author is considering breaking off the engagement if she doesn't work.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The woman comes from a wealthy family. Her father was successful and asked her mother to quit her job when they married. The couple in question can't afford to live on his income alone, and they need her job to support themselves. The woman now wants to quit, which the author sees as a problem because they can't support a family on his salary. The author is giving her an ultimatum: work or break up.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He's concerned about financial stability. They both have significant debt. The house was given by her father, but their current financial situation isn't great. They had a plan that she would work part-time after having a kid, but now she's changed her mind. The author is standing by that plan because they can't support a family otherwise. He's not in a position to support a family alone, so he's being realistic.\n\nOn the woman's side: She comes from a family where her father provided for her mother. She might have grown up expecting that same support, especially since her father is wealthy. She's now applying that model to her marriage, expecting the author to support her financially without working. She might not have considered the author's financial limitations when making her decision. Her decision is sudden and changes their previous plan, which could be a shock to the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for backing out. The author is standing his ground on financial realities. He's not forcing the woman to work, but he's stating that he can't marry someone who won't contribute financially. From a financial perspective, it's reasonable for him to be concerned. The woman's decision to quit her job now, especially when they had a prior agreement, might be the bigger issue.\n\nAnother angle: The woman's choice to attend a state school instead of a more prestigious one where she was accepted, leading to more debt. But the author isn't blaming her for that past decision. He's focusing on the present situation.\n\nThe father's reaction is supportive of the author if he backs out, which might indicate that the father sees the author's stance as reasonable. The mother, however, supports the woman's decision, which adds to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is being honest about his financial constraints. The woman's decision to quit her job now, after they had a plan, could be seen as a breach of their prior understanding. The author is not wrong to have reservations about marrying someone who plans to stop working when they can't afford it. It's a matter of financial responsibility and mutual expectations in a marriage.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being too rigid. If they planned to have a child in a year, maybe they should have considered financial planning more carefully. But the woman's sudden change in plans complicates that. The author is standing by his decision based on their shared financial reality.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The woman made a decision that impacts their financial stability, and the author is right to address it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
