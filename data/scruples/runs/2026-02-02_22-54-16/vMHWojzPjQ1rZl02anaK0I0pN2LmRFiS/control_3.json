Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the one proposing the question) is at fault for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 28, fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have student loans and they have a house from her father. The fianc\u00e9e grew up in a wealthy family where her dad made her mom quit her job. Now she's quitting hers after engagement. \n\nThe author's main issue is financial. They need her income to survive, especially planning for a kid. The fianc\u00e9e didn't plan to use her degree, took loans for a local college where her boyfriend was, and could have gone to a better school with her dad's help. The author feels betrayed because they had a plan for her to work until pre-K, but now she wants to stay home forever. Her mom supports her, but her dad is more reasonable.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to base the marriage on that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for financial realities. He's not okay with a decision that would make their financial situation worse. But he's also considering an ultimatum, which might not be healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e made a life choice based on her family's example. Maybe she didn't realize the financial implications. But she also made choices that led to her having student loans. \n\nThe author's stance is about practicality. He's not forcing her to work, but he's not okay with her quitting when it causes financial strain. The question is whether his reaction is reasonable. Since he's making a decision based on their financial needs, and she changed her mind without considering their prior plans, he's not necessarily at fault. However, the ultimatum approach might be harsh, but the core issue of financial viability is valid. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
