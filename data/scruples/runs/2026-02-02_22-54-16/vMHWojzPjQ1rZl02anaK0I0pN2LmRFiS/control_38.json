Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father made a significant income and her mother didn't work. Now, the author and fianc\u00e9e have their own financial struggles, including student loans and debt. The author proposed, but the fianc\u00e9e suddenly quit her job, planning to be a full-time wife. The author is concerned because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. They had previously discussed a plan where she might take a break after a child but return to work part-time later. However, she's now decided she won't work, which throws off their financial planning.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or call off the marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nLooking at the key points: Financial responsibility, communication, and differing expectations. The author feels that their financial situation can't support a spouse not working, especially with upcoming plans for a child. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems abrupt and not aligned with their prior discussions. The author's stance is about practicality and financial sustainability.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e comes from a family where her mother didn't work, and her father's support influenced her expectations. She might see this as a fair arrangement, similar to her mother's experience. However, the author's financial situation is different from her father's. The author is not in a position to support a family without her income.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for setting a boundary based on financial realities. The author isn't forcing her to work, but is stating that the marriage isn't viable under these terms. The fianc\u00e9e's decision changes their previously agreed-upon plan, which could be seen as a significant shift. The author is prioritizing financial stability, which is a legitimate concern, especially with the existing debts and future child.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job without prior discussion might be the root of the problem. The author had a different expectation. The fact that her mother is supportive might not be relevant here. The key is mutual agreement on major life decisions like financial roles in marriage.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out. It's about differing life goals and financial realities. The answer should be B.\n"
