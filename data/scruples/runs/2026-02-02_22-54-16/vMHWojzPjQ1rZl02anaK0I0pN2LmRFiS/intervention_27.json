Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who is breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work anymore after they got engaged. She's from a wealthy family, and her dad made her mom quit when he got married. The guy feels like they can't afford to live on his income alone, especially with their debts and future plans for a kid.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is concerned about their financial situation. They both have student loans and can't afford a house without her dad's help. If she quits her job, their financial stability is at risk. He wants her to work, maybe part-time later when they have a kid, but she wants to stay home permanently now. He's giving her an ultimatum: work or no marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is influenced by her parents' example. Her dad was wealthy enough to support the family, so she expects the same. But the author isn't in a position to do that. He's 28, she's 26, and they have significant debt. They had a plan to have her work until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind after the proposal. Her mom supports her decision, while her dad is more level-headed and even told the author not to feel guilty if he backs out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and differing expectations about roles in marriage. The author is trying to be realistic about their financial situation. If she quits, they can't manage their debts and future plans. Her decision seems abrupt and possibly naive given their current circumstances. The author isn't forcing her to work indefinitely; they had a plan where she could take time off after the child starts school. She changed her mind without considering the impact on their financial stability.\n\nThe author is also questioning why she took on student loans if she didn't plan to use her degree. That adds to the complexity. He feels she made poor financial decisions in the past, which now affects both of them. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but he's trying to protect their future. It's a valid concern, especially since her father's support isn't infinite, and they can't rely on that forever.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting in the couple's best interest financially. She made a significant life decision without discussing it thoroughly with him, leading to a major conflict. The author's stance is about practicality and long-term sustainability. Her decision to quit now might not be realistic given their financial state. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
