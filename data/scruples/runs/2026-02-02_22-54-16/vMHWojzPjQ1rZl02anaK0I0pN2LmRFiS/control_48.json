Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who proposed the question) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father told her mom to quit her job when they married. Now she's following that example, quitting her job after the engagement. The author is concerned because they both have student debt, can't afford a house without her dad's help, and they need her income to support a future child. The fianc\u00e9e didn't plan to work, even though she took out loans, possibly for a less expensive school because of her boyfriend at the time. They had a plan where she'd work until the kid started school, but now she wants to quit immediately after marriage.\n\nThe author is conflicted between giving an ultimatum or backing out of the engagement. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to assess if the author's decision is justified. The key factors here are financial responsibility, mutual expectations in a marriage, and respect for each other's choices. The author is not in a financial position to support a family without her income, and the fianc\u00e9e's decision changes their original plan. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to not work might be influenced by her parents' example but doesn't align with the author's financial reality.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have compatible life plans. If one partner's decision significantly impacts the other's financial stability and wasn't discussed beforehand, it's reasonable for the author to reevaluate. The author isn't being selfish; he's considering practical aspects. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems to ignore their current financial situation and the reasons they took on student loans. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and making a decision that aligns with his values and circumstances. He's not forcing her to work, but he's choosing not to proceed with the marriage if that's her choice, which is a valid decision given the mismatch in plans.\n"
