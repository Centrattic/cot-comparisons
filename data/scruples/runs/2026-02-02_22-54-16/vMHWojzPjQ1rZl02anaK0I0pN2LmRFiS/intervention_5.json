Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for three and a half years. Both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The woman's father is wealthy and gave them a house, but the author isn't in a position to support a family alone. The woman has quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, which the author didn't expect. They had a plan where she would work until their child starts preschool, then part-time. But she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe author is now considering breaking off the engagement unless she agrees to work. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to make it an ultimatum but also can't support a family without her income. The father supports him if he backs out, but the mother is behind her daughter's decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, some might think it's unfair for him to back out after she quit her job, especially since she might have made the decision based on their previous discussions. However, others might argue that financial stability is crucial and that the author has a right to his own terms in the marriage. \n\nBut looking deeper, the woman's decision to quit her job right after the proposal without prior agreement could be seen as a problem. They had a plan discussed for years, and she changed her mind. The author is trying to communicate that he can't support a family without her income, which is a valid concern, especially with their existing debts. The father's support also adds context that he's being reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's choice to leave her job might be influenced by her mother's example, but the author isn't in the same financial position as her father. The key issue is whether the author is justified in reevaluating the engagement because of financial and practical reasons. Since marriage should be a partnership where both parties are on the same page about major life decisions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address this. However, the timing of her quitting after the proposal complicates it. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because he's prioritizing financial stability and the future of their family, which is a fundamental aspect of a marriage. The woman's unilateral decision without mutual agreement is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
