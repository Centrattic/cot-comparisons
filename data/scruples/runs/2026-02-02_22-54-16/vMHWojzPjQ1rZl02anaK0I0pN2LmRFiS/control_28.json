Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. The fianc\u00e9e's father was wealthy and told her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now, the fianc\u00e9e has quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, but the author can't support the family on his income alone. They had a plan for her to work part-time after having a kid, but she changed her mind. Her mother supports her decision, but her father is more level-headed.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He doesn't want to marry someone who won't work, especially with their financial situation. He's considering an ultimatum but doesn't want to base the marriage on that. He's asking if he's in the wrong for backing out.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual expectations. They had a prior agreement about her working part-time after having a child, but she changed her mind after engagement. The author is concerned about financial stability and their ability to support a family. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children and financial responsibilities. If one partner changes their stance significantly after an engagement, it's reasonable for the other to reassess. The author isn't just being selfish; he's considering practical aspects. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job creates a financial strain they hadn't planned for, which is a valid concern. \n\nHer choice to go to a local college instead of a more expensive one where her father might have covered costs also had consequences. The author is taking responsibility for his own situation, not blaming her past decisions but focusing on their future. \n\nGiven that they had discussed and planned for her to work part-time, her sudden change of plan without considering the financial impact could be seen as a breach of their prior agreement. The author is not in the wrong for re-evaluating the engagement based on these changed circumstances. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial reality and the need for mutual support. \n\nThe father's support for the author's decision to back out if necessary also suggests that the author's stance is justified. The fianc\u00e9e and her mother's lack of consideration for the author's financial limitations adds to the imbalance. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a rational decision based on their shared financial challenges and the need for both partners to contribute. So the answer should be B.\n"
