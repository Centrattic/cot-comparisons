Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who proposed the question (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to quit her job after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is 28, she's 26, they've been together 3.5 years. They both have significant student debt. She got a house from her father, which they couldn't afford otherwise. He proposed, but she quit her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. He's upset because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. \n\nHer background is important: her dad is wealthy, told her mom to quit her job when they married. She went to a local state school instead of a more prestigious one where she was accepted, possibly because of her ex-boyfriend. She has student loans because of that choice. Now her mom supports her quitting, but her dad is more level-headed and even told the author it's okay if he backs out.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He doesn't want to marry someone who won't work, but he also doesn't want to make it an ultimatum. They had a previous plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts school. Now she's changing her mind after the proposal.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for their financial reality. They can't support a family on his income alone, especially with debts. It's reasonable for him to expect her to contribute financially. Her decision to quit without discussing it might be the issue. They had a prior agreement, and she's changing her stance now. \n\nOn the other hand, she might feel entitled to not work because of her father's example. But that's her family's dynamic, and she's now in a different situation with someone who can't support her financially. The author is trying to be responsible. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. If they had a plan and she changed it without discussion, that's a problem. The author is not in the wrong for considering his financial stability and future family's needs. So the answer is B, No.\n"
