Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because the fianc\u00e9e decided not to work once they get married. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e quit her job, expecting to be a stay-at-home wife. The author argues that their combined income is necessary, especially with their debts and future plans like having a kid. They had a previous plan for her to work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she's changed her mind. The author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up the engagement.\n\nSo, the main points are financial responsibility, future planning, and differing expectations. The author is worried about financial stability and the feasibility of supporting a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her father's example, wants to be a full-time homemaker. The author feels this wasn't discussed enough before the proposal.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is justified. Financial issues are a common reason for relationship problems. If they had a prior agreement about her working, and she's now changing her stance without considering the financial reality, the author has valid concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job right after the proposal might be seen as abrupt and not considering the practical implications. However, the author is also making a decision to back out, which could be seen as breaking the engagement, which is a big step.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being responsible about their financial situation. Marrying someone who expects to not work when their income is necessary is unsustainable. The fianc\u00e9e might argue that she's willing to make sacrifices, but the author is concerned about both their debts and future expenses. The author's father-in-law seems to support the decision to back out, which might indicate that the author is right to consider financial stability.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did they discuss these expectations before the proposal? If they didn't, maybe the author is at fault for not addressing it earlier. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out now. Given the financial pressures and the change in plans after the proposal, the author's decision seems reasonable. The key is whether her decision to quit was a deal-breaker that the author couldn't accept. Since the author is worried about their combined financial situation and future plans, it's a valid reason to reconsider the engagement. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
