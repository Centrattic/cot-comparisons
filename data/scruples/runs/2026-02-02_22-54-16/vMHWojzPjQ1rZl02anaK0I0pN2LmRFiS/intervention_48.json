Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who's backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. The main points are their financial situations, her decision to leave her job, and their future plans.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they both have significant student debt and can't afford a house on his income alone. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family, and her father gave them a house. But he's not in a position to support a family like her father did. They had a plan where she would work for a few years after having a kid, but she's now quitting her job and wants to stay home permanently. Her mother supports this, but her father is more level-headed and even told the author it's okay if he backs out.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he doesn't want to marry someone who won't contribute financially, especially since they need her income. He's considering an ultimatum, but he's also worried about making the decision based on pressure.\n\nNow, considering the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, the community often looks at whether someone is acting unreasonably. The key here is mutual expectations in a marriage. The couple had discussed a plan where she would return to work after some time, but she's changing her mind after the proposal. The author is standing by their original plan, which is reasonable because financial stability is crucial. Her decision to quit without discussing it seems to ignore their financial realities. The father's support for the author's decision also suggests that this is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that people have different values. She might feel that she's entitled to not work, given her family's wealth, but the author can't support the same lifestyle. The fact that they had prior agreements and she's now changing her mind could be seen as her being in the wrong. The author isn't forcing her to leave her job without discussion; he's trying to uphold their previous understanding. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out because they need her income to manage their shared financial responsibilities, and she's altering the plan unilaterally.\n"
