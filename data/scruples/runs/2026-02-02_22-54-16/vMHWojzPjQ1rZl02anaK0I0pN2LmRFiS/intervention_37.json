Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to quit her job and not work once they get married. \n\nFirst, there's the financial aspect. Both have significant student loans and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's family is wealthy, and her father gave them a house. But the author can't support the family on his own income, especially with the added cost of having a child in a year. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to stop working now, without a plan, could leave them in a tough spot financially. \n\nThen there's the issue of the fianc\u00e9e's career choices. She went to a local state college instead of a more prestigious one where she was accepted, possibly to be with a boyfriend. She took on student loans that she might not have if she had chosen a different school. The author is questioning why she pursued a degree if she didn't plan to use it after marriage. \n\nThe original plan was for her to stop working once they had a child, part-time then full-time later. But she's changing that plan now. Her mother supports her decision, but the father seems more level-headed and even suggested it's okay if the author backs out. \n\nThe author is conflicted because he doesn't want to force her into working through an ultimatum, but he can't see how to make the marriage work without her income. The key here is whether the author is wrong for backing out. \n\nFinancial dependence can be a huge issue in a marriage. The author isn't in a position to support a family on his own, and the fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision changes their entire financial plan. The author's stance is about practicality and responsibility. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't commit to a marriage that might not be financially viable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions seem to disregard the financial realities they both face. Her decision to quit her job now undermines their previous agreement and adds debt from her student loans. The author is trying to protect their future, which seems reasonable. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author isn't wrong for backing out. He's making a responsible choice based on their financial situation and the need for mutual support in the marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision isn't considering these factors, and the author is justified in seeking a resolution that's sustainable.\n"
