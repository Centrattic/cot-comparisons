  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but now she's quitting her job because she wants to stay home once they're married. He's backing out of the engagement because they can't afford it otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 28, she's 26, and they've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have substantial student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. She's just quit her job, which they need for their financial stability, especially if they plan to have a kid. The author feels that they need her income to survive, and he's not in a position to support a family alone like her father did. \n\nOn the other hand, her decision to quit her job might be influenced by her upbringing. Her father told her mother to quit her job when he proposed, so maybe she's following that example. But the problem is that their financial situation isn't the same as hers. The author isn't in a position to support a family without her income. Also, there's the issue of her student loans and choosing a local state college over a more prestigious one where she was accepted, leading to more debt. \n\nThe author is giving her an ultimatum to work or not get married. He's not sure if this is healthy but feels it's necessary for their financial stability. The key points here are financial responsibility, shared plans for the future (like having a kid), and differing expectations about work after marriage.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing her to work, but he's backing out because he can't support the family alone. He's also considering the long-term, like having a child. It seems like he's realistic about their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind about working after the proposal, which might not have been discussed enough beforehand. The author is standing his ground because they need her income, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe he should have discussed this more before proposing. But the problem is she made a unilateral decision to quit her job after the proposal, which disrupts their plans. The author is trying to be responsible, considering their debt and future child. The father-in-law even supports backing out if it's not feasible. So it seems like the author is justified in his decision. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
