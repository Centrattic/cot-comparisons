Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job after getting married, which is causing a conflict. The author is considering breaking off the engagement because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that they need her income to support their future family, especially given their debt and financial situation. They can't afford to have her quit, especially if they plan to have a kid. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, wants to follow in her mother's footsteps who didn't work after marriage. Her father was wealthy enough to support her mom, but the author isn't in that position. Also, she went to a local state college instead of a more prestigious one, leading to more debt.\n\nThe author is giving her an ultimatum: work or not get married. They're worried about financial sustainability and their future child's needs. The fianc\u00e9e's side might argue that she's making a personal choice about her life and career, which is her right. However, the author sees this as a deal-breaker because of their financial realities.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being reasonable. Marriage is a partnership, and both should have a say in major life decisions. The author isn't forcing her to work, but they can't support a family without her income. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels she's entitled to quit once married, maybe influenced by her family's example. But that example isn't applicable here because the author isn't as wealthy as her father.\n\nThe key here is whether the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit is a valid choice in the context of their financial situation. The author is acting in their self-interest, but is it fair to back out of the engagement over this? They had a prior plan to have her work until the kid starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal. The author feels it's a significant change that affects their financial stability.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about compatibility. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e isn't wrong for wanting to choose not to work, but the two can't reconcile their needs. Since they can't agree on this major aspect, the author's decision to back out isn't necessarily wrong. They're choosing to protect their financial future, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e might feel betrayed, but the author has the right to be honest about their needs.\n"
