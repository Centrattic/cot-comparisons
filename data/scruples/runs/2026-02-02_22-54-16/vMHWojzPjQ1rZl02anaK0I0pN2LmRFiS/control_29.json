Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father is successful in construction. Her father told her mother to quit her job when they got married, which seems to be a model she's following. The couple both have significant student loan debt and financial challenges. They currently live in a house given to her by her father. They had a plan that she would work for a few years after having a child, similar to her mother's fairy tale scenario, but now she's decided to quit her job immediately after the proposal. The author is upset because their financial situation wouldn't support her not working, especially with their debts and future plans for a child.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum to work or break up the engagement. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to get married on an ultimatum but feels it's necessary for financial stability.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about personal choices versus financial responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e has the right to choose her lifestyle, but the author is concerned about their future financial health. The father's model might not be feasible for the author's situation since he's not as wealthy. The author is trying to communicate his financial limitations, which is reasonable. Marriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions, including career and financial plans. If one partner is making a decision that significantly impacts the other's financial stability without considering the partner's input, that's a problem. However, the author is now reacting to a decision that seems to have been made unilaterally. \n\nIs he in the wrong for backing out? If the engagement is based on mutual plans that she's now changing without discussion, then her decision could be the issue. But the author is now trying to address it. The ultimatum is a strong move, but if both parties can't agree, breaking off the engagement might be necessary. The author might not be in the wrong if he's acting in good faith to address their financial realities.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job without considering their financial situation and the author's concerns could be the main issue. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, and backing out if they can't agree isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
