  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful and she didn't work because her father told her to quit her job after they got married. Now, the author and the fianc\u00e9e are both in their late 20s, have significant student debt, and the house they live in was given by her father. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job, assuming she wouldn't work anymore after marriage. The author is upset because they need her income to support themselves and plan to have a child. He's not in a financial position to support a family alone, unlike her father. They had a plan where she would work part-time after the child started pre-K, but now she's changed her mind. The author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are financial responsibility and mutual expectations in a marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job immediately after engagement without discussing the financial implications is a problem. The author had a different plan, and the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart disrupts their financial stability. The author's stance is about practicality and shared responsibility. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to not work because of her family's example. However, the author isn't wealthy and their circumstances are different. The ultimatum comes from a place of necessity, not just being controlling. The fianc\u00e9e's decision may have been impulsive, not considering the couple's financial reality. The father's support for the author backing out suggests that the author is justified in his decision. So, the author is not in the wrong because he's making a responsible choice based on their shared financial situation.\n"
