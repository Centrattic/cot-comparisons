Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for 3.5 years, both have student debt, and her father gave them a house. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy but made her mother quit her job when they married. Now the fianc\u00e9e, after the proposal, quits her job because she wants to be a homemaker. The author is upset because their combined income is necessary for their financial stability, especially if they plan to have a kid. They had previously discussed a plan where she would work until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: she works or they don't get married. He also mentions not wanting to get married on an ultimatum, which he thinks might be unhealthy. The father-in-law is supportive of the author backing out if needed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's concerned about their financial situation. They need her income to manage debts and future child expenses. He's not in a position to support a family alone, unlike her father. He's also upset she changed her plan without considering their financial realities. \n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9e's side, she's influenced by her mother's experience and her father's wealth. She might believe that being a homemaker is what's expected or desired. Her decision might stem from personal values or family influence. However, she's changing a plan they had discussed, which the author finds unfair. \n\nMarriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her stance on working, which affects their financial stability, the author has a right to be concerned. The author isn't forcing her to work, but he's recognizing that the current plan might not be feasible without her income. \n\nThe father-in-law's support for the author backing out if needed also suggests that the author isn't entirely wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might not have considered the author's financial limitations, which is a valid point. \n\nHowever, the author is also considering giving an ultimatum, which can be a tough choice. But given the financial realities and the previous agreement they had, it's understandable. The key here is whether the author is justified in his decision based on the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties have different perspectives. The author is being realistic about their financial needs, while the fianc\u00e9e is influenced by her family's example. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their agreed-upon plans and financial necessity. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the impact on their shared future. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
