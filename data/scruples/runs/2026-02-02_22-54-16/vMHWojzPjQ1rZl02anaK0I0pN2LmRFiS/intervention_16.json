Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful and her mother didn't work after marriage. Now, she's 26, they've been dating for 3.5 years, both have significant student debt, and they have a house given by her father. The author proposed, and she decided to quit her job, which leads to financial stress because they need her income. They had a plan where she would work until their child starts pre-K, but she changed her mind.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He doesn't want to marry someone who won't work, especially since he can't financially support a family alone. He's considering an ultimatum, but he's also worried about the health of the relationship if he does. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision, but the dad is more understanding.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and financial responsibility. The couple had discussed their future plans, including her working until the child starts school. If she changed her mind without prior discussion, that might be a problem. The author is concerned about their financial stability and the feasibility of their plan without her income. \n\nHe's not blaming her past decisions, like going to a local college for her boyfriend, but is focusing on the current situation. The author is trying to be responsible and realistic about their financial situation. His father-in-law even supports the idea that he shouldn't be in a position where he has to support a family without the means. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might believe she's following her family's example, but that doesn't align with the author's financial reality. The author's stance is about practicality and shared responsibility, which is a valid concern. \n\nIf the author backs out, it's because he's standing by his values and the financial agreement they had. It's not about control but about ensuring their future stability. So, in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong because he's making a responsible decision based on their circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e changed her commitment without considering the impact, which the author is right to address.\n"
