Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around a fianc\u00e9 who wants to back out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is financial. They have significant student loan and credit card debt, and they can't afford to support a family on his income alone. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful, and her mother didn't work after marriage. She's following a similar path, quitting her job now that they're engaged. The author feels that this decision is financially irresponsible, especially since they need her income for their future plans like having a child.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side: She grew up seeing her mother not work, and she's happy to follow that model. However, the author argues that their financial situations are different. They aren't as wealthy as her father, and relying solely on his income isn't feasible. There's also the issue of her student loans, which could have been avoided if she went to a different school. But the author isn't blaming her for past decisions, just the current ultimatum.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial responsibility and differing life expectations. The author is setting boundaries based on their financial reality. He's not being cruel but is realistic about their ability to support a family. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job now, without a clear plan for financial stability, complicates their future. The author's ultimatum is about ensuring they can manage together, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe father-in-law's support by saying there should be no bad feelings if the author backs out adds another layer. It suggests that the family acknowledges the financial challenges. The author isn't being inconsiderate; he's making a decision based on practicality. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to stop working now, without prior agreement, disrupts their previous plans, which the author is addressing.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking into account their shared financial future. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job isn't inherently wrong, but the timing and the financial implications are issues. The author is not the one at fault here because he's being honest about their financial limitations. The fianc\u00e9e may have different expectations, but the author is acting in the couple's best interest by not proceeding with the marriage if they can't support each other financially.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a practical decision based on their financial situation and is not being unreasonable in setting boundaries for their shared future.\n"
