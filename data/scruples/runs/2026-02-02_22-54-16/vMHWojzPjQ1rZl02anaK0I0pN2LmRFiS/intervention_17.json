  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's engaged and wants to back out because his fianc\u00e9e is quitting her job and doesn't plan to work after marriage. They both have student loans, and they need her income to support a kid. The guy feels like he can't support her financially like her dad did, and he's not okay with her not working. The fianc\u00e9e's mom is encouraging her to quit, while the father is more level-headed. They had a plan to have her work until the kid starts Pre-K, but now she wants to leave her job after engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main point is that they can't afford to live without her income, especially with future kids. He's taking responsibility for their financial situation and wants to be realistic. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's following her mother's example, maybe she wants to be a homemaker, or she's made a choice based on what she sees as a traditional role. But he's not in the same financial position as her father, so he can't support that lifestyle. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author isn't forcing her to work, but he's saying he can't marry her if she quits her job. Is that fair? Well, they had prior discussions about balancing work and family, but she changed her mind after the proposal. Maybe she didn't communicate her intentions clearly. The guy is realistic about their financial constraints. \n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding and planning are important. If she didn't want to work after marriage, but they had a plan, and then she changed her mind, maybe that's on her. But the author is standing by his decision based on their circumstances. He's not trying to control her, just being honest about what he can handle. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's background is that her father didn't work because he was supported, but the author can't do that. The author is being responsible. So backing out might be the right choice for him. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on their shared financial situation and realistic expectations.\n"
