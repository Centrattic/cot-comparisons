Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is considering whether to back out of their engagement because their fianc\u00e9e has decided to quit her job and not work after they get married. The key points are that they both have student debt, they can't afford a house without her income, and they had a previous plan where she would work for a few years after having a child. Now she's changed her mind and wants to stop working immediately, which the author feels is not feasible financially. Her family's wealth is mentioned, but they had a history of supporting her father's business, and her father's attitude towards supporting her education is also a factor.\n\nFirst, I should look at the financial aspect. They can't afford to live without her income, which is a real concern. If she quits now, they might struggle to pay off debts, cover living expenses, and prepare for a child. The author is worried about financial stability, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems to come out of the blue and not align with their previous agreement. The author's plan was for her to stop working temporarily after a child, which makes sense because childcare can be expensive. Now she's changing her mind, which disrupts their financial planning.\n\nThen there's the issue of her student loans. She went to a local state school instead of a more prestigious one recommended by her father, leading to higher debt. The author is upset that she took on debt for a degree she might not use. But maybe that's not directly the author's problem unless they're responsible for her debt. However, they both have debts, so it's a shared issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's mother's influence is mentioned. She supported the father's decision to quit her job, which might have set a precedent. But the author isn't as wealthy as her father, so the same approach isn't feasible for them. The father is more level-headed, which is a good sign, but the mother is fully behind her daughter's decision, which could indicate that the fianc\u00e9e isn't getting the support the author needs.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or not get married. That's a tough position, but if the fianc\u00e9e's decision is unrealistic given their financial situation, maybe it's necessary. However, setting an ultimatum can be seen as harsh if not done thoughtfully. The author is trying to balance their financial needs with the relationship, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that marriage should allow her to focus on family, which is a traditional view. However, the author's financial situation doesn't support that. The key question is whether the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a valid personal choice or if it's causing the author to be in the wrong by backing out.\n\nI think the author is justified in their concerns. They can't support a family on their own income, and the fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision disrupts their plans. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and making a decision based on their circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e is choosing a path that the author can't afford, so it's reasonable for him to reconsider the marriage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
