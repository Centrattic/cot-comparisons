Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to quit her job and not work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 28, his fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have student loan debt and couldn't afford a house on their own, which was given to her by her father. The key issue here is the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job after the proposal, which the author sees as problematic because they need her income to support them, especially if they plan to have a child. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasoning seems to be influenced by her father's example, where he asked her mother to quit her job after marriage. She might have internalized that idea and thinks she can do the same. However, the author can't afford to support a family alone like her father did. The author is now giving her an ultimatum: work or not get married.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, so I need to evaluate if the author's position is justified. \n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the author is right to be concerned. They need her income to manage their debts and future child. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without discussing this thoroughly is a problem because it changes their financial plan. The author is pointing out the reality of their situation versus the idealistic expectation she had based on her parents' example.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have discussed his concerns earlier. But given that they had a previous plan where she would return to work after having a child, and she changed her mind post-proposal, the author is justified in re-evaluating. The ultimatum is a result of her sudden decision conflicting with their financial realities. \n\nHer choice to attend a less prestigious school and take on debt for a relationship might also play a role here. The author is highlighting the consequences of that past decision now. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't forcing her to work, but he's standing his ground based on their current situation. It's a matter of differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a responsible decision based on their financial needs. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial implications is the root issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
