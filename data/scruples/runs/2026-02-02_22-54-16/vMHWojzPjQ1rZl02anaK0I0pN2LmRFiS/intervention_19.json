Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't want to work anymore once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been dating for 3.5 years. They both have student loans and couldn't afford a house on their own. She got a house from her dad. He proposed two months ago, but she quit her job saying she wants to be a wife and not work. They need her income, especially if they have a kid. They had a plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she changed her mind. Her mom supports her, but her dad is more level-headed.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He doesn't want to marry based on an ultimatum but feels it's necessary. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFactors to consider: Financial stability, plans they discussed, her changing her mind after engagement, her family's influence, and their previous agreement. The author is concerned about their financial future and the practical aspects of marriage. He's making a decision based on their shared plan and financial reality. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, which affects their financial plans. The author is trying to address this before marriage, which is a significant life decision. It's about compatibility and realistic expectations for marriage. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate financial expectations. If she changed her mind without discussion, it could be a problem. The author is standing up for their shared financial needs. Since they had a plan and she deviated, the author isn't wrong to reconsider. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
