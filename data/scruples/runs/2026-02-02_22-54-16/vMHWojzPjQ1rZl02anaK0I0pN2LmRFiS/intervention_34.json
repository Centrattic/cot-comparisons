Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after marriage. \n\nFirst, the context: The woman comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful. Her father's approach was to have her mother quit her job when they got married. The couple in the story has significant student debt and couldn't afford a house without the woman's father's support. The author proposed, and then the woman decided to quit her job, leading to a conflict because they need her income to support their financial situation, especially if they have a child. The woman's plan now is to never work again, which conflicts with their previous agreement about her working part-time after a child starts pre-K.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum to work or not marry her. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to enter the marriage with an ultimatum, but he also can't support a family on his income alone. The woman's mother supports her decision, but the father is more understanding and even suggests backing out if necessary.\n\nSo, the key points are: financial dependency, differing life plans, and the woman's change in commitment. The author is trying to balance his financial reality with his partner's expectations. From a traditional standpoint, some might say that once you're engaged, you should work through issues. However, financial stability is a major factor here. The woman changed her stance without prior agreement, which the author finds unsustainable. The father's support for his side adds another layer, indicating that her decision is not financially feasible.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be on the same page about major life decisions. If the woman isn't willing to compromise and the author can't support the financial burden, backing out might be necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and his own ability to support the family. He's also being honest about his limitations. While it's a difficult decision, it's a responsible choice given their circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
