  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The situation is about an engagement where the fianc\u00e9e decides to quit her job after the proposal because she wants to be a homemaker, but the author can't support the family on his income alone. They both have student loans and can't afford a house without her father's help. The author feels backed into a corner because their previous plan was for her to work part-time after having a kid, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nFirst, I should consider their agreement. They had a plan where she would work until pre-K, then part-time. Now she's quitting, which disrupts that plan. The author is worried about financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's family is wealthy, but her father expects them to make their own way. The author is in a tough spot because he can't afford to support both their debts and a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision, but her dad is more level-headed and even told the author it's okay to back out. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations in a marriage. If they had discussed this before the engagement, maybe they could have found a compromise. The author is setting an ultimatum now because the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the proposal. Is it fair for him to expect her to work? Well, they both have financial obligations, and the author isn't in the same position as her father. The fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to not work because of her family's background, but the author can't support that financially. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this more before proposing. However, the fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision after the proposal, which could be seen as breaking their prior agreement. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to ensure financial stability, especially with future plans like having a child. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial impact might be the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong if he's standing by his decision to not marry someone who can't contribute financially.\n"
