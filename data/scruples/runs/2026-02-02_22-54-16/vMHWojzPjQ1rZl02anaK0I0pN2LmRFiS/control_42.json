Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she didn't want to work anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job because she wanted to focus on being a wife. They both have significant student loan debt and can't afford to live without her income. The author feels that her decision to quit is financially irresponsible, especially since they plan to have a kid soon. They had previously discussed a plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she wants to quit entirely.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side is that her father quit his job after marriage, so she's following that example. Her mother also supports her decision. The author is frustrated because her income is crucial for their financial stability. He's also upset that she didn't go to a more prestigious school and incurred debt unnecessarily.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The key points here are about financial responsibility and mutual agreements in a relationship. The author is concerned about the future, especially with plans for a child. If she quits her job, they might not be able to afford the lifestyle or the child's needs. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might feel that her husband-to-be should support her decision, especially given her father's example.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a marriage, financial planning is essential. If both partners don't agree on major life decisions like career and finances, it could lead to serious problems. The author had a plan, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the financial implications. The author is trying to protect their future, which seems reasonable. However, breaking off an engagement is a big decision, and the author is now giving an ultimatum, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job right after the proposal without discussing it thoroughly might be the root issue. The author is reacting to a sudden change in plans that affects their financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's family background might make her view financial independence differently, but the author isn't in the same financial position as her father.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial realities and the agreed-upon plans. The fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision that could jeopardize their future, so the author has the right to re-evaluate the engagement. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
