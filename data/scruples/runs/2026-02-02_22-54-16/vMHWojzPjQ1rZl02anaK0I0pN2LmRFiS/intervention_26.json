Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an engagement being broken off because the fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married. The author is questioning if they're at fault for backing out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman in this scenario comes from a wealthy family, her father was successful in construction and her mom didn't work. Now, she's in her mid-twenties, they've been together a while, both have student debt, and they have a house given by her dad. The author proposed, but she then quits her job, expecting to stop working. The author is upset because their financial situation isn't stable enough to support a family on his income alone, especially with plans to have a kid soon. They had a prior plan where she would work until the kid starts Pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to proceed with the marriage if she's not going to work. The woman's decision to quit her job seems to come as a surprise, even though they had discussed plans for her to work for a few years. The author feels betrayed because her income is necessary for their financial stability, and he can't support a family alone. \n\nI should consider the financial aspect first. Both have significant debt, and their current situation is not stable. If she stops working, they would be relying solely on his income, which might not be feasible. The author's concern is valid because they need to manage their debts and future child's needs. The woman's decision to quit her job immediately after engagement without discussing it more thoroughly might be the problem here. \n\nThen there's the issue of her education. She took loans to attend a local college instead of a \"real school\" chosen by her dad, leading to more debt. The author is frustrated that she didn't use her degree and now has debt, which adds to their financial strain. However, her choice of college was influenced by her relationship at the time, which is a personal decision, and maybe not something to blame her for now.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's mother supports her decision to stop working, which might be influencing her. But the father is more supportive of the author stepping back, recognizing the financial realities. The father's advice to let the author decide without pressure is a good point. The author is caught between wanting to honor their prior agreement and the new change in plans.\n\nNow, the author is considering an ultimatum: she works or they break up. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to end the marriage on an ultimatum but also can't support a family without her income. The question is whether the author is at fault for this decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The woman changed her mind after the engagement, which the author didn't expect. The author's financial concerns are legitimate. The woman's expectations might not align with the author's ability to support a family. If the woman was aware of the financial constraints and still chose to quit her job, the author's decision to back out seems justified. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed this issue earlier, maybe during the engagement discussions. But since they had prior plans and she changed her stance after the proposal, the author's reaction is understandable. The woman's family background of financial privilege might not account for the author's financial reality. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a decision based on financial sustainability and their prior agreements. The woman's unilateral decision to quit her job without considering their financial needs is the key issue here. The author is responding to a situation that threatens their stability, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
