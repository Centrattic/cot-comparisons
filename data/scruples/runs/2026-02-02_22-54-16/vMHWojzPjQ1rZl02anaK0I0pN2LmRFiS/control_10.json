Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once married. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: They've been dating 3.5 years, both have significant student debt, live in a house given by her father. The fianc\u00e9e's father was wealthy and had her mother quit her job when they married. Now the fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job immediately after engagement, which the author can't support financially.\n\nThe author is concerned about their financial stability. They need her income to survive, especially if they have a kid. The fianc\u00e9e's plan to not work at all contrasts with their previous discussion of her working part-time after pre-K. The author is considering giving an ultimatum, but doesn't want the marriage to be based on that.\n\nKey points to consider: Financial responsibility, mutual expectations in marriage, respect for each other's choices. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is influenced by her family's example (her father's wealth), but the author's situation is different. The author isn't in a position to support a stay-at-home spouse financially, which could lead to stress and instability.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's choice to attend a local college due to a relationship, leading to debt, might show poor financial planning. The author isn't at fault for realizing they can't support a spouse's lifestyle that's financially unsustainable for them. The author is trying to communicate realistic expectations for their future.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems he's acting in their mutual best interest by not proceeding with a marriage that's financially unfeasible. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind about work plans after the proposal, which disrupts their previous understanding. The author's decision to back out is based on practicality, not just personal preference. The father's support for the author's decision also suggests that this is a reasonable stance.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
