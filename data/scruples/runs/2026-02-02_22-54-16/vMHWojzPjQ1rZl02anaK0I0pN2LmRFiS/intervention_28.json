Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the one who proposed and is now considering backing out) is in the wrong for ending the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work after marriage. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for 3.5 years, both have significant student debt, live in a house given by her father. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is causing financial strain. The author wants her to work, as their combined income is necessary for their lifestyle and future children. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her father's example, believes she should stay home, but the author can't support that financially.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations and financial responsibility. The author isn't against the idea of one parent staying home eventually, but the timing and the fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision without discussion is a problem. She also went to a less expensive school due to her ex, leading to debt. The author feels betrayed that she didn't plan to use her degree and now expects him to support them both when he can't.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is concerned about the practical aspects of marriage. Marriage requires shared responsibilities and financial planning. If one partner is unwilling to work and the other can't support a family alone, that's a legitimate issue. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems abrupt and without considering their financial realities, which the author has a right to address.\n\nThe father's support for the author's decision also plays a role, indicating that the author isn't overreacting. The fianc\u00e9e's mother is fully behind her, but that doesn't resolve the financial problem. The author is setting boundaries based on their current situation, which is reasonable. Ending the engagement over a fundamental disagreement in life plans isn't necessarily wrong, especially when it affects their ability to support a family.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a hard decision based on their circumstances, prioritizing financial stability and shared responsibility in marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's actions may stem from her upbringing, but the author isn't obligated to accept terms he can't support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
