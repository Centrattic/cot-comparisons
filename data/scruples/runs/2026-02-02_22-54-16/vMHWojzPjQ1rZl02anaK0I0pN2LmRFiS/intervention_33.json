Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e, but then she quit her job because she didn't want to work anymore after marriage. They have a lot of student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. The author is concerned that her income is necessary for their financial stability, especially planning for a kid in the future. They had a previous plan where she might take a break during the child's early years and then return part-time, but now she's decided to never work again. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports this decision, but her dad is more level-headed and even says it's okay if the author backs out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're 28, their fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been together for 3.5 years, which is a significant time. Financial stability is a big concern here. They both have debt, and the house they own was given by her father. So their current financial situation is pretty tight. When the fianc\u00e9e quits her job, the author is worried because they can't support both their incomes and the upcoming child. It seems like a practical concern. The author is setting boundaries based on their ability to financially support a family. They also had a prior understanding about her working part-time later, which is now discarded. That must be a shock, hence the fight.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is tied to her father's example. Her dad told her mom to quit her job when he proposed, implying that once married, she shouldn't work. The fianc\u00e9e might have internalized this belief, thinking that being a wife means not having a job. But her decision to quit immediately after engagement contradicts the previous plan they had. Also, she took out student loans for a degree she doesn't plan to use, which adds to the financial burden. The author is frustrated because they need her income and the sudden change in her stance is causing financial strain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author is prioritizing financial security, which is a valid concern. Marriage involves big life decisions, and if both parties can't agree on essential matters like financial responsibilities, it's a problem. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without discussing the financial implications shows a lack of consideration for the author's situation. The author is not making an ultimatum in a controlling way but rather recognizing that the relationship can't sustain without both incomes. The dad's support for the author's decision also suggests that he sees the issue from the author's side. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her choice to leave work is about her identity and happiness. But in a marriage, both parties need to make compromises. The author isn't saying she can't take a break; they had a plan. The fianc\u00e9e unilaterally changed that, which is a breach of their prior agreement. The author is not wrong for needing her to contribute financially. It's a matter of compatibility. If the author can't support the family financially with their current income, then it's a real issue. The AITA (Am I the A**hole) part is whether the author is justified in walking away. Since the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to work despite the financial need and changed their mind on the plan, the author's decision seems reasonable. They're not forcing her to work but acknowledging that their current financial situation doesn't allow for her to not work. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
