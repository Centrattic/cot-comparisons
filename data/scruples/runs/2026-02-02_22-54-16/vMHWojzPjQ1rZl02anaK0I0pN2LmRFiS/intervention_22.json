Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they're married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The author (he) proposed, but the fianc\u00e9e (she) then resigns from her job, expecting to be a homemaker. The main issue is financial. They both have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. The author is concerned that her income is necessary for their financial stability, especially if they plan to have a kid. He wants her to continue working, maybe part-time after the kid starts school. But she's decided to stop working entirely, influenced by her mom's example, and her father's previous support. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, expectations in marriage, and autonomy. The author is worried about their financial future without her income. He's also pointing out that she had student loans unnecessarily because she chose a less prestigious school for her boyfriend. Now, he's not okay with her quitting, leading to the breakup. \n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e's side: her father told her mom to quit her job when they got married, so she's following that example. Her mother's situation might have been possible because her father was wealthy. But the author isn't in the same financial position. She might not have considered that their financial needs are different. Also, she didn't plan to use her degree, which led to debt. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for backing out. The author is prioritizing financial stability. It's reasonable for him to expect that both incomes are necessary. If she wants to be a homemaker, but they can't afford it, he's right to have concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be impulsive, especially since they had discussed a plan where she would work until the kid starts Pre-K. She changed her mind after the proposal, which seems like a major shift without prior discussion. \n\nHer mother's support and her father's more level-headed approach suggest that the family is aware of the financial issues. The author's ultimatum is a reaction to her decision, which he sees as financially irresponsible. However, the author is also not wanting to get married on an ultimatum, so he's trying to find a middle ground. \n\nIn relationships, mutual expectations are crucial. If both partners have different long-term plans regarding work and finances, it's important to address them before marriage. The author might feel that the financial reality doesn't align with her sudden decision to quit. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel her choice is valid based on her family's example. \n\nBut given the financial situation, the author isn't wrong to be concerned. It's a valid reason to back out if they can't find a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's change in plans after the proposal could be seen as not considering the financial implications, which the author has the right to prioritize. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
