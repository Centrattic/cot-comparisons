Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a man who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. He's upset because they need her income to survive, especially with plans to have a kid in a year. He's considering backing out of the engagement if she doesn't work.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about financial responsibility and expectations in marriage. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father expected her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now she wants to follow the same path, but the author can't support the family on his income alone. They both have significant student debt, and the house they live in was given by her father. The fianc\u00e9e went to a local state college instead of a more prestigious one, leading to more debt. The author is frustrated that she didn't plan to use her degree and now wants to leave her job, which he sees as a sudden change in their agreed-upon plan to work until the kid starts school.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. From a moral standpoint, people have different expectations about marriage. In some cultures, it's common for one spouse to stay home, especially if they have financial means. However, in this case, the author doesn't have the financial stability to support a family without both incomes. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job seems to be a significant change in their prior understanding. They had a plan where she would return to work part-time after the child starts Pre-K, but she's now choosing to leave her job entirely.\n\nHer decision could be seen as self-centered because it ignores their financial realities. The author is responsible for their debts and needs her income to make ends meet. By backing out of the engagement, he's choosing to end the relationship rather than enter into a marriage where he can't support the family. On the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9e has the right to her choice, but she should have considered the financial implications before making such a decision.\n\nThe father's support for the author's decision adds another layer. It shows that even her family understands the financial pressures. The fianc\u00e9e's mother is behind her decision, which might not be helpful in this context. The author is in a tough spot because he's not in a position to support a spouse financially, and the fianc\u00e9e's choice is creating a conflict between them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about autonomy and mutual responsibility. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their financial stability. He's making a tough choice based on reality. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job without considering the practical implications could be seen as irresponsible. However, it's also about personal choice and lifestyle preferences. But since marriage requires partnership and shared responsibilities, the author's stance is about ensuring both parties can contribute to the household's well-being.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting in the interest of financial responsibility and the agreed-upon future they had planned. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart without considering the financial impact is the root issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B for No.\n"
