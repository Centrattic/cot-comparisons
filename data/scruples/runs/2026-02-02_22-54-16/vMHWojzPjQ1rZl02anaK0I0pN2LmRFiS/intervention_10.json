Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong after backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job to stop working once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the story. The author is 28, his fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student debt and can't afford a house on their own. She got a house from her father, and her family is wealthy. The father's example was to ask her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now, after proposing, she tells him she's quitting her job because she wants to be a homemaker. He's upset because they need her income to support their future, including having a child. They had a plan for her to work until the kid starts pre-K, but she's changed her mind. Her mom supports her, but her dad is more level-headed. The author is considering an ultimatum: she works or they break up.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at the situation, the author backs out because he can't support the family financially if she quits. He's concerned about their shared debt and future kid. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems sudden and contradicts their previous agreement. Her choice to attend a local state school instead of a \"real\" one (as her father called it) led to her having student debt, which adds to their financial burden. The author's father-in-law is supportive of the author backing out, which is a point in his favor.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is influenced by her mother's fairy tale scenario from a wealthy family, but they aren't wealthy. The author is right to consider practical matters like financial stability, especially with their debts and plans for a child. The author isn't forcing her to work, but he's standing by his decision not to marry someone who can't contribute financially. The ultimatum is a last resort, but it's based on mutual respect for their financial realities. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems he's prioritizing practicality and honesty. If they can't support each other financially as planned, moving forward with the marriage would be unsustainable. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in plans without prior discussion might be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for wanting to avoid a financial crisis in the marriage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
