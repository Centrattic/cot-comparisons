Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after getting engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been dating three years. They both have student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. He proposed, and she quit her job immediately, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. The author is upset because their combined income is necessary, especially since they plan to have a kid soon. They had previously discussed that she might stay home once they had a child, but the timeline would be after Pre-K starts. Now she's saying she's done working entirely, which is causing a conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. They want to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, key points here: the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job after engagement, the financial strain, their prior plans versus her current stance, her family's influence (father's wealth, mother's support), and the ultimatum the author is considering.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is worried about financial stability and their future with a child. The fianc\u00e9e might see it as her right to choose not to work, influenced by her parents' example. But her father did support her financially, similar to how he supported her mother, but the author isn't in the same financial position.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author isn't wrong if he feels the decision is based on incompatible life plans. However, some might argue that he should have addressed this earlier in the relationship if it's a deal-breaker.\n\nBut given that they had discussed a plan where she would work part-time later, and she unilaterally changed her mind after engagement, the author is justified in re-evaluating. The fianc\u00e9e's decision could be seen as not being transparent or respectful of their prior agreements. The author's stance is about practicality and financial necessity, which are valid concerns in a marriage.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
