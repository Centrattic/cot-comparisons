Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after they got engaged. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 28, she's 26. They've been dating 3.5 years. They both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy, and he gave them a house. The author proposed two months ago, but she then quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker. The couple needs her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a kid in a year. The author is worried about financial stability and their future. They had a plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she's saying she won't work at all. The author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up the engagement. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to force her but also can't support a family alone with their current debts.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, planning, and mutual expectations in a marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job seems abrupt and possibly without considering the financial implications. The author is concerned about their ability to manage debt and future family expenses without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's mother supports her, but the father seems more level-headed and understanding if the author backs out.\n\nLegally and ethically, marriage is a partnership that requires mutual consent and compromise. If one partner's decision significantly impacts the other's ability to meet financial obligations, it's a valid reason to reassess the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on work without prior discussion, which disrupts their previously agreed plan. The author is acting in his own interest to ensure their financial stability, which is reasonable. However, using an ultimatum might be harsh, but the context shows he's trying to address a real problem.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision could be seen as self-centered, given the financial realities they both face. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their shared circumstances. It's important to consider that marriage requires both parties to contribute, and if one can't meet their part due to changing circumstances, it's a problem that needs addressing. The author's choice to back out, while difficult, is about protecting their future together from financial strain. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
