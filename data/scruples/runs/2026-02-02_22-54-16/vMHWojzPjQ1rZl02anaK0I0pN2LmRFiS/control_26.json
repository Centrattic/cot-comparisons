Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has significant student loan debt, and the fianc\u00e9e's father gave them a house. The fianc\u00e9e has just quit her job, planning to be a stay-at-home wife. The author is upset because their income is necessary for them to survive, especially if they plan to have kids. The fianc\u00e9e's mother supported her decision, but her father seems more understanding of the author's financial concerns.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and differing expectations about work post-marriage. The author feels that they can't support a family on his income alone and that her decision to quit is abrupt and financially irresponsible. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her parents' example, seems to expect the author to take on the financial burden without working.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is standing up for his financial reality. He's not in a position to support a family without her income, and her sudden decision changes their financial plan. It's important in a marriage to have mutual understanding and agreement on major life decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e was aware of the financial situation and their previous plan (working until pre-K, then part-time), but changed her mind without discussion, that's a breach of their agreement. The author is right to address this, as marrying under different expectations could lead to future conflict and financial strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to not work, given her father's example. However, the author's situation is different, and he's not in a position to support a dual-income household. It's about whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Since he's being upfront about his inability to support a family on his income alone, he's not being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering their financial situation is the main issue here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a responsible decision based on their financial reality and the need for mutual agreement in a marriage.\n"
