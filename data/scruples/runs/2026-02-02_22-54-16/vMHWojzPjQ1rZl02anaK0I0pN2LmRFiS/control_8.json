Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work once they're married.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibilities. They both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father gave them a house, but they still need her income to manage, especially if they plan to have a child soon. The author feels that her sudden decision to quit her job is financially irresponsible and conflicts with their previous agreement to work part-time after having a child. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e was raised in a family where the husband is the sole provider. Her father told her mother to quit her job upon marriage. She might feel that this is the norm for her family and expects the same. She might see her decision as a personal choice, possibly influenced by her upbringing and the idea that marriage allows her to step back from work. Her mother supports this, so it's a family expectation.\n\nThe author is now considering an ultimatum: she works or they break up. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to force her but also can't support the family on his income alone. The question is whether he's in the wrong for backing out. \n\nFactors to consider: Financial responsibility, communication, mutual understanding. Did they discuss their future plans before? The author mentions they had a plan where she would return to work after the child starts pre-K. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the proposal, which the author sees as a contradiction. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect her to work? It depends on their prior agreements. If they had discussed and agreed on a plan, then her changing her mind without discussion might be an issue. However, if there was no formal agreement, maybe she's making her own choice. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e might have felt that after marriage, she's entitled to stop working, influenced by her parents' example. The author's financial situation doesn't allow for that. They have debts and need dual income. The father-in-law supports the author's decision to back out, indicating he sees her choice as unreasonable now. \n\nThe author's stance is that he can't support a family on his income alone, and he's not as wealthy as her father. This is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision could lead to financial instability for the couple. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's making a decision based on financial necessity, which is a practical aspect of marriage. If they can't agree on financial responsibilities, proceeding with the marriage might lead to conflict. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the proposal, which might have broken the prior understanding. \n\nHowever, the author is also setting an ultimatum, which could be seen as controlling. But given their financial situation, it's a necessary decision for him. It's a tough call, but the core issue is financial compatibility and whether they can find a middle ground. Since the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to compromise and the author can't support the family without her income, he's acting in his best interest. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a responsible decision based on their financial realities and the need for mutual contribution to their future.\n"
