Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 28-year-old guy who's been engaged to his fianc\u00e9e for two months. She's 26, they've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan debt, and the only house they have is from her father, who's a wealthy man in construction. The issue is that the fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job after the proposal, not wanting to work anymore once married. The author is upset because they can't survive on his income alone, especially if they plan to have a kid in a year. They had previously discussed a plan where she would leave work for a few years after a child, then return part-time and full-time later. Now she's changing her mind, and her mom supports her. The author is considering breaking off the engagement if she doesn't work, and the fianc\u00e9e's father is understanding if he backs out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is financial stability. They have debt, need her income, and can't afford to have her quit. He's worried about supporting a family. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is following a model she's seen in her mother's life, where her mother didn't work because her father supported the family. She might see staying home as a traditional role, especially given her family's wealth. However, the author isn't in the same financial position as her father, so that model doesn't work for them.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought they had a plan for the future where she would work part-time after the kid starts school. But now she's changed her mind, which disrupts that plan. The fianc\u00e9e might have felt that once married, she could stop working, influenced by her mother's example. However, she didn't communicate this change in her stance before the engagement, which could be a problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his financial reality. He's not willing to be in a marriage where he can't support both of them and a future child. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she has the right to choose to stop working, especially if she's coming from a family that supports that choice. But if they had discussed their plans and she changed her mind after the proposal, that could be a breach of the mutual agreement they had.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to go to a local state school instead of a more prestigious one that her father would have paid for, leading to her debt, might be a point of contention. But the author is not blaming her for that past decision, which shows he's trying to be fair. However, the fact that she took on debt for a degree she might not use could be a factor in their current situation.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum, which is a tough choice. If he backs out, is he in the wrong? Or is she in the wrong for changing her stance? It depends on whether there was prior agreement. The author thought they had a plan, but she changed her mind. If they didn't have a clear agreement before the proposal, then maybe he's overreacting. But if they did discuss their future plans and she agreed to a certain path, then changing now could be the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the financial dependency. The author's fianc\u00e9e's family has provided significant support, including the house. If they rely on that support, maybe the author is in a position where he needs to ensure sustainability without that help. But the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her father's support is enough, not considering the author's ability to support them independently.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't forcing her to work, but he's saying he can't marry her if she doesn't work. That's a personal choice. Is it his right to make that decision? If the marriage requires mutual support and financial stability, then it's reasonable for him to set boundaries based on his ability to support the family. However, if the fianc\u00e9e's choice is her personal decision and he's not willing to accept it, then he has the right to walk away.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a decision based on their financial realities and the plans they had discussed. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the proposal, which affects their mutual future. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
