Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an engagement where the fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job after marriage, and the author is considering backing out. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9e have been dating for 3.5 years. Both have student loan debt. The house was given by her father. The author proposed, and then she quit her job, which they need for their finances and future plans like having a kid. The author is upset because she didn't plan to use her degree and went to a local college instead of a better one. The father is supportive if they back out, and the mother is fully behind her decision.\n\nSo, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e changing her mind about working after the proposal. The author feels it's a deal-breaker because they can't afford to live on his income alone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by considering backing out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they need her income, they have debt, and she's making a significant life choice that affects their financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's side is that her parents' example (like her mom not working) influenced her, and she wants to be a stay-at-home mom. However, the author isn't in the same financial position as her father, so it's not feasible.\n\nIs it fair for the author to expect her to keep working? Well, they had previously discussed a plan where she would return to work part-time after their child starts pre-K. She changed her mind after the proposal, which upends their financial plans. The author is concerned about their ability to support a family without her income, especially with existing debt. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if they had a prior agreement and she's now changing it unilaterally, the author has a right to back out. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is impacting their shared future, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for re-evaluating the engagement. Also, the author is not in a position to financially support a family on his own, so expecting her to quit might be unrealistic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being pragmatic, and marriage should be based on mutual support. But given the financial realities, the author's concerns are valid. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is making a significant change to their financial plan without considering the author's ability to support them both. \n\nThe father's support for backing out if needed also suggests that this is a tough situation where financial responsibility is a key factor. The author isn't being unreasonable for prioritizing their financial stability. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
