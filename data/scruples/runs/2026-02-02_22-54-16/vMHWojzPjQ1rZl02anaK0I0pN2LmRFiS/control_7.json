Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's engaged to a woman who has decided to quit her job and not work after they get married. The main issue is their financial situation and whether she's willing to work.\n\nFirst, the backstory: Her father was wealthy and told her mom to quit her job when they married. Now the author and his fianc\u00e9e have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her dad's help. The author proposed, and then she quit her job, thinking she can be a stay-at-home wife. He's upset because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid soon. They had previously agreed she might stay home after the kid starts pre-K, but she's now changing her mind and wants to never work again. Her mom supports this, but her dad, who's more level-headed, says it's okay if the author backs out.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. Financial responsibility: They can't afford to live on the author's income alone. Student loans and debts are a big burden. If she quits, their financial stability is at risk.\n\n2. Prior agreements: They had discussed a plan where she would work part-time after the child starts school. She's deviating from that, which the author sees as a problem.\n\n3. Her education and student loans: She went to a local state school, possibly influenced by her boyfriend at the time, leading to student debt. The author questions the decision since she might not use her degree if she quits.\n\n4. Her father's support vs. financial reality: The father's business was successful, but the author isn't in a similar financial position. The father's advice (to his daughter) might not apply here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out because she won't work after marriage.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's concerned about their financial future. If she stops working, they can't meet their obligations, and having a child adds more pressure. He's not in a position to support a family alone, unlike her father. His decision to back out is based on practicality and responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is influenced by her family's example (her mother didn't work) and her desire to be a homemaker. Her mother supports this, but she might not have considered the financial implications fully. The author's ultimatum could be seen as a way to address the real financial issues they face.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing financial stability? It's a tough call. Marriage is about partnership, and both should be on the same page. If she changed her mind about working without discussing the financial impact, that's a problem. The author is acting in the couple's best interest by not proceeding with a marriage that's financially unsustainable.\n\nBut is he in the wrong for making an ultimatum? Maybe not. He's standing his ground because the situation has changed from their previous agreement. However, the way he approaches it (ultimatum) might be unhealthy. The question is whether his reasoning is valid. Since they need her income and she's making a decision that affects their future, his stance is understandable. He's not forcing her to quit but is standing down because she won't work.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a practical decision based on their financial realities and the change in her plans. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
