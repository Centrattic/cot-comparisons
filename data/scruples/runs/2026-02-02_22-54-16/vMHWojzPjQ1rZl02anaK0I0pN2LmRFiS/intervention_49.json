Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to quit her job and not work once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author is 28, fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father gave them a house, which is their only asset. The author proposed two months ago, but now the fianc\u00e9e has quit her job, stating she wants to be a wife and not work anymore. The author is upset because their financial situation is precarious, and they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. The fianc\u00e9e went to a local state college instead of a more prestigious one her father wanted, leading to more debt. They had a previous plan where she would stay home for 3-4 years with a child, then return part-time and later full-time. Now she's changing that plan to never work again.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or not get married. He's worried that getting married under such an ultimatum isn't healthy.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out because of her decision to quit. Let me break down the arguments.\n\nOn the author's side: He's concerned about financial stability. They have significant debt and need her income. He can't support the family alone like her father did. He had a prior agreement about her working part-time later, but she's changing her mind. The father-in-law is supportive if he backs out. The author is trying to be realistic about their financial situation and future family plans.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9e's side: She's following a model set by her parents, where her mother didn't work. She might feel entitled to the same after financial support from her father. She might believe that marriage should provide financial security without her working. Her decision is sudden, causing conflict. She might not see the financial implications as clearly as the author does.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations. In some cultures, it's common for one spouse to stay home, especially if they have financial support. But here, the financial situation is different. The author can't support the family alone. Her decision to quit might be unrealistic given their current debt and future plans like having a child. The author is trying to be responsible, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't considering the financial reality.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e made a decision after the proposal, which the author didn't anticipate. The author feels betrayed because they had discussed a plan, and she changed her mind. The ultimatum is a response to a significant change in her commitment to their previous agreement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9e decided not to work, and the author can't support the family, it's reasonable for him to reassess the marriage. Marriage requires mutual support and realistic planning. If one partner can't contribute financially, and it's a deal-breaker for the other, then the author isn't wrong to back out. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is a major change in the relationship's foundation. The author is prioritizing financial responsibility and future stability for a child, which are valid concerns.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, his concerns are valid. He's not being selfish; he's considering the practicality of their situation. The fianc\u00e9e's expectations might be based on her father's wealth, which isn't applicable to their current situation. The author is not the one changing his stance; it's the fianc\u00e9e who suddenly changed the plan after the proposal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out.\n"
