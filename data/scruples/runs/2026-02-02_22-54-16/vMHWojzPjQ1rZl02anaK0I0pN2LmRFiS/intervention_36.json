Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (the person who proposed and is now breaking off the engagement) is in the wrong. The situation is that his fianc\u00e9e quit her job because she doesn't want to work anymore after marriage, which the author feels is impractical given their financial situation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main concerns are financial stability. They have significant student debt, live in a house provided by her father, and they both need their incomes to support a future kid. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her father's example (who supported her mother financially), wants to be a stay-at-home wife, but that's not feasible for them right now. \n\nThe author feels that quitting her job now undermines their financial planning. They had a previous plan where she'd work part-time after the child starts school. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate this change in her stance properly, leading to a major fight. The author is now considering backing out of the engagement because he can't support her financially without her income.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the question is whether the author is justified in breaking off the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is a significant life change that affects both their futures. The author is being realistic about their financial situation, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e might see her choice as a personal right, but it's causing conflict because they can't afford to have one income. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; he's trying to plan for their future, including having a child. The fianc\u00e9e's lack of communication about her decision to quit her job is a problem. The author had a plan that included her returning to work part-time, but she changed her mind without discussing it properly. \n\nThe father's support for the author's decision to back out if needed adds another layer, showing that financial responsibility is a family concern. The author isn't forcing the engagement on her; he's considering the practical aspects of marriage, which include financial stability. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her new stance effectively, leading to the conflict. The author is trying to address this by considering an ultimatum, which is a tough but necessary step given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision based on their financial realities, which is responsible. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is causing a conflict, but the author's response is a valid reaction to the situation they're in.\n"
