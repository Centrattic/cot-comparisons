Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after they got engaged. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father expected her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now, she's following that model by quitting her job after the engagement. The author is concerned about their financial situation\u2014both have significant student debt, and they can't afford a house or a child without her income. They had a previous agreement that she would work until their child starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is in a different financial situation than her father. Her father could support a family without another income, but the author can't. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job right after the proposal disrupts their plans and financial stability. The author is worried about their ability to support a child, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e went to a state school instead of a more prestigious one, which led to more debt. The author isn't blaming her for past choices but is concerned about current realities. Her mother supports her decision, but the father is more level-headed and even backs the author if he backs out. \n\nIn terms of relationship health, the author is trying to be realistic about their future. If they can't agree on financial responsibilities, getting married could lead to more problems. The author is not acting out of spite but out of necessity. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's entitled to not work after marriage, based on her mother's example. However, the author isn't wealthy and can't support a family alone. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but it's a way to set boundaries for their future. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation and future plans. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the impact, and the author is trying to protect both their interests.\n"
