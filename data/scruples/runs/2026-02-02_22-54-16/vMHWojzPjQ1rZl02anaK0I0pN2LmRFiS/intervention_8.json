Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's engaged to a woman who just quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker once they get married. The main issue is that the author can't support them both financially, especially with their debts and future plans like having a kid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The fianc\u00e9e grew up in a wealthy family where her father told her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now she's following a similar path, but the author isn't in the same financial position as her dad. They both have significant student debt, and they can't afford to live without her income. The author proposed, and now she's quit, which he sees as a betrayal of their initial plan to have her work part-time after having a kid.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual planning. The couple had discussed a plan where she would work until their child started school. She decided unilaterally to quit, which disrupts their financial stability. The author is now considering backing out of the engagement if she doesn't work, which he frames as a necessary decision for their future.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability. He has a valid concern about their ability to support a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems to be based on her family's example, but that might not align with their current circumstances. The author isn't being unreasonable in expecting her to contribute financially, especially since they both have debts to manage.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's choice to attend a local state school because of her previous boyfriend might have led to unnecessary debt if she wasn't planning to use her degree. That's a personal decision, but it adds to the financial burden. The author is right to question the practicality of her not working when they can't afford it.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to leave her job based on her family's values. However, the author isn't as financially secure as her father was. The fact that her father supports the author backing out if necessary shows that he sees the financial reality.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for backing out because the financial situation doesn't support her quitting. He's making a responsible decision to ensure their future stability. The fianc\u00e9e's actions disrupted their agreed-upon plan, and the author is justified in prioritizing financial practicality over her current desires.\n"
