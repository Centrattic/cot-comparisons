  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup over financial and career decisions.\n\nSo the guy proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, but he can't support the family on his income alone. He's worried about their debts and future plans like having a kid. They had discussed a plan where she'd work part-time after the kid starts school, but she changed her mind. Her mom supports her decision, but her dad is more understanding.\n\nHe's considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong for backing out because she quit her job.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is financial responsibility and differing expectations. The woman comes from a wealthy family, and her father's example influenced her to quit her job after marriage. However, the author can't afford that lifestyle. They had a prior agreement about her working part-time, but she's changed her stance. The author is trying to be responsible about their future, considering their debts and need for dual income.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's not wrong for wanting financial stability. If she's making a decision that could jeopardize their ability to support a family, it's reasonable for him to have concerns. On the other hand, she might see this as traditional gender roles or personal choice. But the problem is that they had a plan, and she changed it without considering the practical implications. The author is standing by his original plan, which he had discussed with her. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's being honest about his financial limitations and the prior agreement. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but given the circumstances, he's trying to maintain financial responsibility. The answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's acting in the interest of their shared future and financial stability.\n"
