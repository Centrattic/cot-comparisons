Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 28, his fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student loan and credit card debt. Her father is wealthy and gave them a house, but the author isn't in a position to support a family alone. He proposed, and then she quit her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. They had a major fight because they need her income, especially if they have a kid soon.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e grew up in a family where her father told her mom to quit her job after marriage. She went to a state college instead of a \"real school\" to be with her boyfriend at the time, leading to student debt. She had a plan to stop working after the kid starts pre-K, but now she wants to quit immediately after engagement. Her mom supports her decision, but her dad is more level-headed and even told the author to back out if he can't support her financially.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or don't get married. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to make it an ultimatum but feels it's necessary financially.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break down the factors.\n\n1. Financial Responsibility: The couple can't afford to lose her income. They have debts and depend on her salary. Marrying someone who then quits a job that's essential for their financial stability could lead to serious issues. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child without her income.\n\n2. Communication: They had a prior plan where she would work until the child started school. Now she's changed her mind suddenly. Was there a discussion about this? The author might feel betrayed if she didn't communicate this change earlier.\n\n3. Her Background: Growing up in a wealthy family where the mother didn't work might have influenced her expectations. However, that doesn't necessarily make her decision right if it's not feasible for their financial situation.\n\n4. Education Choices: She went to a local school instead of a better one to be with a boyfriend, leading to higher debt. The author is frustrated that she didn't plan better, but he also acknowledges past decisions can't be changed.\n\n5. Ultimatum: The author is considering an ultimatum, which can be a heavy decision. However, if her quitting job creates an unsustainable situation, he's acting to protect their future. \n\n6. Her Decision to Quit Post-Engagement: She quit after the engagement, which might be seen as a breach of the prior agreement they had. The author might feel this is a major change without his consent.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be responsible. He's not in a position to support a family on his income alone, and her sudden decision disrupts their plans. Her mom's support adds pressure, but her dad is more realistic.\n\nThe key points here are financial viability and mutual agreement on life plans. Marriage requires partnership, and if one partner's decision significantly impacts the other's ability to manage finances, it's a valid concern. The author is choosing not to proceed with the marriage under these circumstances, which seems reasonable given their financial realities.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's possible he's being pragmatic. Her decision to quit without considering the financial impact could be the issue. The author is standing up for their shared future, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
