Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job after they get married. He's arguing that they can't afford to live on his income alone, especially with their student debt and future plans for a child. She comes from a wealthy family where her dad made her mom quit her job after marriage, so she's following that example. The guy is upset because they had a plan where she would work for a few years after having a kid, but now she's changing her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author feels that they need her income to support their family and their financial situation is already tough. He's not in a position to support her without her working, unlike her father. He's also frustrated because she took on student loans unnecessarily by choosing a local college instead of a better school her dad would pay for. So, he's giving her an ultimatum: work or break up.\n\nOn her side, she's following the example set by her father, which is common in some families. She might genuinely believe that once married, she doesn't need to work, especially since her family is wealthy. Her mom supports her decision, but her dad is more understanding. She might not have considered the financial realities of their current situation, leading to a sudden decision that disrupts their plans.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual understanding. The author is standing his ground because they can't afford to live without both incomes, and he had a different plan. He's not forcing her, but setting a boundary that is necessary for their future. Her decision to quit without discussing it properly might be the root of the problem here. \n\nHowever, maybe he should have talked to her more about their financial plans before proposing. But the problem is that she unilaterally decided to quit, which he didn't agree with. He's not wrong in needing her income. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a reasonable decision based on their financial situation.\n"
