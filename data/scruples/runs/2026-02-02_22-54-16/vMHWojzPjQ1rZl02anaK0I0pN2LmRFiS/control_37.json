Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe guy is 28, his fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have a lot of student debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. Her father is wealthy and ran a successful construction business. When he married her mother, he told her to quit her job and not work anymore, which influenced her. Now, after the guy proposed, she quit her job, expecting to be a homemaker. He's upset because they need her income, especially if they have a kid. They had a plan where she'd work part-time after the kid starts pre-K, but she's changed her mind and wants to stay home indefinitely. Her mom supports her, but her dad is more level-headed and tells the author he shouldn't feel obligated if he can't support a family alone.\n\nThe guy is now considering backing out of the engagement if she doesn't agree to work. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The woman's decision to quit her job is a significant change from their previous agreement. They had discussed a plan for her to work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she wants to stay home forever. The guy is worried about financial stability, especially with their combined debt and the high cost of childcare. Her family's financial support is a factor, but they can't rely on that indefinitely. Her father's example (telling her mom to not work) might have influenced her expectations, but the guy isn't in the same financial position as her father.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the guy is concerned about their future financial security. It's reasonable for him to want her to contribute financially, especially since they both have debts. If she quits her job, they lose her income, which complicates their ability to have a child and manage expenses. The woman's decision to not work might be based on her family's example, but that doesn't necessarily make it right for their situation. The guy is setting boundaries based on practical considerations, not just wanting her to stay home for traditional reasons.\n\nHowever, the woman might feel that she's entitled to stay home because of her father's example. But since they had a prior agreement, changing that without discussion could be seen as a breach of their mutual understanding. The guy's ultimatum is a response to her unilateral decision. While ultimatums can be harsh, in this case, he's trying to address a fundamental issue in their relationship plan. He's not forcing her to work, but he's stating that he can't marry her if she won't work, which is a valid concern given their financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the woman has the right to make choices about her career, especially after marriage. But the problem is that her decision affects their shared financial stability. The guy isn't wrong to want her to contribute to their household's finances, especially with their debts and future plans. Her father's support might not be sustainable, and relying on it isn't practical.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a practical decision based on their circumstances. The woman changed the plan without considering the financial impact, and he's addressing that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
