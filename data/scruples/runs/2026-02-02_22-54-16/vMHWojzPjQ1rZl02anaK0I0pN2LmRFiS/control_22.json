Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job once they get married. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The woman comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful. Her dad told her mom to quit her job after marriage, so maybe she grew up with that model. Now, the author is 28, she's 26. They've been dating 3.5 years. Both have significant student debt. Her dad gave them a house, but they can't afford it without his help. The author proposed, but she quit her job, expecting to be a stay-at-home wife. They need her income for their financial stability, especially planning to have a kid in a year. The author is upset because they had a plan for her to work until the kid starts school, but she's changed her mind.\n\nThe author is considering backing out, giving her an ultimatum to work or not get married. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to pressure her but feels they can't afford her quitting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, factors to consider: Financial responsibility, differing expectations. The woman's decision to quit is based on her family's example, but the author's financial situation can't support that. They had a prior agreement about her working until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind. The author is standing by their original plan, which seems reasonable given their debts and the need for dual income.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to commit to a financially unsustainable situation? Probably not. They need to be realistic about their shared finances. Her decision is a major life change that affects their stability. The author is trying to align their expectations, which is necessary in a marriage. The father's support for the author's decision also suggests that the author isn't wrong. The ultimatum is a way to address incompatible plans. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
