Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she won't work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family. Her father ran a successful construction business and told her mom to quit her job when they got married. Now, the author and fianc\u00e9e both have significant student debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. The author proposed, but then she resigned, planning to stop working immediately. He's upset because they need her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a kid. They had discussed a plan for her to work until the kid starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, mutual plans, and communication. The author is concerned about their financial stability without her income. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance from their previous agreement, possibly influenced by her mother's example, but her father is more realistic. The author is now considering an ultimatum.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for backing out? Well, in a committed relationship, especially when planning marriage, financial compatibility is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to stop working without discussing it with the author could be seen as a significant change that affects both partners. The author had their plans, and her sudden decision disrupts that. The fianc\u00e9e's reasoning seems to be based on her parents' example, but their financial situations differ. The author isn't as wealthy as her father, so he can't support a family alone. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she didn't communicate this change in her plans earlier. They had a mutual understanding, and now she's changing it, which creates financial stress. Backing out might be a responsible decision rather than proceeding into a marriage that could lead to financial strain. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and wanting to avoid an unsustainable situation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed this issue sooner instead of giving an ultimatum. But given the circumstances, the author is making a tough choice to protect both their future. The fianc\u00e9e's actions might have been self-centered, not considering the practical aspects of their financial situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out; it's a matter of conflicting priorities and realistic planning.\n"
