Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job after he proposed. He's concerned about their financial stability since they both have student debt and need her income to support a future child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful and her mother didn't work. She's used to a certain lifestyle. The couple has financial struggles, including student loans and debts. He proposed, and then she quits her job, which he sees as a problem because they need her income. They had prior agreements that she would work until their child starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after engagement.\n\nThe man is giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong).\n\nFactors to consider: Financial dependency, communication, changing plans after engagement, past discussions about work post-children, her financial decisions (like attending a state school instead of a \"real school\"), and her father's support.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some might argue that both partners should contribute financially, especially when there are debts and plans for children. However, others might say that the woman has the right to choose her path, especially if her financial situation allows her to quit. But in this case, the couple's financial stability is at risk if she quits. The man is being realistic about their financial needs. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, which could be seen as breaking prior agreements they had. Her mother's support for her decision might add to the conflict, but the father is more level-headed.\n\nThe key points are communication and prior expectations. Did they discuss the plan for her working before the engagement? If they had agreed on a timeline (work until pre-K, then part-time, etc.), her quitting now without discussion could be a breach. The man is acting to maintain financial stability, which is a responsible move. However, using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, he's trying to protect both of their futures.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's making a rational decision based on their financial reality. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after making plans, which could be seen as her issue. The answer would be B.\n"
