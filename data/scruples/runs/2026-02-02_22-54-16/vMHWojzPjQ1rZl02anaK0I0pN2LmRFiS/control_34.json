Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't want to work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan debt, and the fianc\u00e9e's father provided them a house. The author proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e then resigned from her job, expecting to be a stay-at-home wife. The author is upset because their financial situation can't support her not working, especially since they plan to have a child. The fianc\u00e9e had previously considered working part-time after the child starts pre-K, but now changed her mind after the proposal. The father supports the author if he backs out, and the mother is fully behind the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and expectations in the relationship. The author feels that they need both incomes to manage their debts and future child. The fianc\u00e9e wants to leave her job, which wasn't discussed properly before the proposal. The author is now giving an ultimatum, but is that the right approach?\n\nFinancial stability is a major concern. The author isn't in a position to support a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job comes after the proposal, which might indicate a lack of prior discussion about financial plans. The author had a different plan involving part-time work later, but she's changing it now. This could show she didn't consider the financial realities they discussed earlier.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's educational choices and debt: she went to a less expensive school where her partner at the time was, leading to higher debt. The author is questioning why she took on debt if she planned to stop working. This might add to the frustration, as her financial decisions now affect their combined future.\n\nThe father's support for the author if he backs out suggests that the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. However, backing out after the proposal could be seen as breaking trust, especially if the decision was made impulsively. But if the financial aspects were not realistically discussed, the author is justified in re-evaluating.\n\nIn terms of communication, if the couple hadn't properly discussed work and financial plans before the proposal, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job now is a problem. The author is now in a dilemma between honoring the commitment or protecting their financial future.\n\nThe author's ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach, but it's a reaction to a significant life decision made without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changing her mind post-proposal without discussing the financial implications could be seen as irresponsible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out, as he's considering their shared financial realities and the future of their family.\n"
