Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's engaged to someone who suddenly decides to quit her job and not work anymore after they got engaged. He's upset because they can't afford to live without her income, especially with their student debt and plans for a kid. She seems to be following her mom's example where her dad made her mom quit her job when they got married. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability. They have significant debt and can't support a family on his income alone. Her quitting might put them in a worse financial situation, making it harder to afford a child and their existing debts. That's a legitimate concern, especially if they had prior plans for her to work part-time after having a kid.\n\nOn the other hand, she might feel that she's making a personal choice about her career and family life. Maybe she wanted to prioritize being a full-time parent, which is a valid decision for some people. However, the problem here is that they hadn't discussed this plan before the engagement, and she made a sudden decision, leading to a major conflict.\n\nHer background: her dad is wealthy and could support her staying home, but the author isn't in that position. The father's example might have influenced her expectations, but the author's situation is different. The fact that her mother also supported her decision might not help, as the author is the one who has to manage the finances.\n\nThe author is considering breaking off the engagement because of this, giving her an ultimatum. Is that fair? Well, if they had previously discussed plans where she would work part-time after having a kid, and she changed her mind without discussion, that's a big issue. The author is standing his ground on financial realities, which seems reasonable. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for backing out? If they had different expectations about work and family roles, and she made a decision that goes against their prior agreement, then it's a legitimate reason to re-evaluate the marriage. Marriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions, and if she's not willing to compromise, then the author might be right to back out. \n\nAlso, her student loans and choosing a less expensive school for relationship reasons might not directly affect the current issue, but it shows a pattern of decisions based on personal circumstances rather than financial prudence. However, the main issue is her decision to quit without prior discussion, conflicting with their financial plan.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial realities and the need for mutual agreement on life plans. The answer should be B.\n"
