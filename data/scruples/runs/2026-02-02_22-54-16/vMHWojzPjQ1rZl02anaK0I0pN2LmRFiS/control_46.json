Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after deciding to back out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e plans to quit her job after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed, but the fianc\u00e9e, inspired by her father's example, wants to quit her job and stop working once they're married. The couple has significant student debt and can't afford to survive on his income alone. They had previously agreed that she might stay home when they have a kid, but maybe part-time later. Now she's decided she won't work at all, and he's considering an ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, differing expectations about marriage roles, and communication. The author is concerned about their financial stability without her income, especially with plans to have a child. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy background where her father supported her mother without work, but their situation is different. The author might feel that she didn't fully consider the financial implications or communicate her intentions earlier.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for backing out? Well, he's making a decision based on his own financial reality and the need for both incomes. If they can't meet their financial needs without her working, it's a valid concern. However, calling it an ultimatum might be seen as pressuring her, but he's also trying to be honest about his inability to support the family alone. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without discussing it might have come as a surprise, which could have been a communication issue.\n\nThe father-in-law's reaction is supportive of the author backing out if it's not feasible, which adds credibility to the author's stance. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's following her family's example, but that doesn't align with their current financial situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about differing values and expectations. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability and honesty in the relationship. He's standing up for his needs and the practical aspects of marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her upbringing, but if it's not realistic for their situation, the author is justified in reevaluating the engagement. So, the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
