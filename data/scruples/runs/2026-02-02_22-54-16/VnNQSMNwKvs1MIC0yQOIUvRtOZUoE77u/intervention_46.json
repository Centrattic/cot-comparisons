There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the details of the situation again. The author was a judge in a music competition for teenagers. One of the competitors, Ryan, who uses a wheelchair, played very poorly. The author gave him a 7 out of 100, which was much lower than the other two contestants. However, the audience and the crowd really rallied around Ryan, leading to the organizer making the author publicly retract their judgment, which resulted in Ryan winning. The author is now being accused of being an asshole, but their friends say they're not wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is a professional musician with experience, and they believed Ryan's performance was subpar. Judging is supposed to be based on the quality of the performance, not on the contestant's background or circumstances. However, the crowd's reaction was in favor of Ryan, possibly due to his disability and the emotional narrative. The organizer then forced the author to change their judgment, which might be a conflict of interest. \n\nOn one hand, the author's responsibility as a judge is to evaluate the performances objectively. If Ryan's performance truly was as bad as described, the author's score might be justified. But the audience's reaction and the mother's insistence might indicate that the competition was more about inspiration or overcoming adversity rather than pure talent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's public retraction and the subsequent handling of the situation could have been more sensitive. Even if the author's initial judgment was correct, the way the situation was handled might have been unprofessional, especially if the organizer pressured them to change their decision. The author's blunt response to Ryan's mother might have escalated the confrontation unnecessarily. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Did the author judge based on merit? 2) Was the competition's intent about talent or inspiration? 3) How did the author handle the aftermath? \n\nIf the competition's purpose was to reward talent, then the author's low score is appropriate. However, if the competition was intended to be more inclusive or about perseverance, then the author's strict judgment might be seen as harsh. The author's friends think they did the right thing, but others might argue that the author was insensitive to the emotional and social dynamics at play. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reaction to the mother, saying \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he's not as talented,\" might come off as dismissive, not considering the broader context of the competition's purpose. The author might not be in the wrong for their initial judgment but could be criticized for not handling the situation with more empathy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the competition was strictly about talent, then the author was correct. But if the event was meant to be a platform for people with disabilities to showcase their efforts, the author's approach was inappropriate. The author's actions led to a loss of credibility and caused emotional distress, which could make them at fault for not considering the event's intent and the audience's perspective.\n"
