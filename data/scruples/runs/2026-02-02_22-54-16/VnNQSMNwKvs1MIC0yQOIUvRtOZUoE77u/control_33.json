There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a contestant with a disability in a talent competition. \n\nFirst, the author was a judge, so their responsibility is to evaluate based on talent and performance. They gave a very low score to Ryan, who has a disability, which led to controversy. The key points here are the author's justification for the low score versus the potential bias or insensitivity towards Ryan's situation.\n\nThe author claims Ryan's performance was worse than someone who had never played the piano. However, the crowd and other judges might have considered effort, overcoming challenges, or emotional impact. The fact that Ryan changed his piece and the crowd still cheered suggests that they valued his perseverance. The author's strict technical evaluation might have conflicted with the emotional or motivational aspects others saw.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author acted wrong. Judges are supposed to be fair and consistent. The author didn't hide their opinion, but they also didn't consider the broader context of the competition's purpose. Maybe the event wasn't just about technical skill but also about encouraging participants, especially those with disabilities. The organizer forced the author to change the result, which complicates things. However, the author's initial judgment was based on their assessment, which might be valid, but the way it affected others\u2014like the crowd's reaction and Ryan's mom's confrontation\u2014shows that the author's approach might have been insensitive.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole but said they weren't wrong. That's a conflicting point. Legally or ethically, the author followed their professional judgment, but socially, they might have failed to account for the event's spirit. The problem is whether judging purely on skill is acceptable when the competition might value participation and personal challenges. If the rules didn't specify technical skill as the sole criterion, the author's judgment could be seen as narrow-minded. However, if the rules emphasized skill, then maybe not. Since the author was part of the judging panel, their role is to apply the judging criteria. The conflict arises when the criteria clash with public perception or the event's intended message.\n\nIn the end, while the author might have done their job by the rules, their lack of empathy or consideration for the event's purpose could make them at fault. The fact that the organizer had to reverse the decision suggests that the author's approach was inappropriate in the context. Also, Ryan's mom's reaction indicates that the author's actions had negative repercussions beyond just the competition. So, even if technically correct in their assessment, the author's inability to handle the situation sensitively might mean they're in the wrong.\n"
