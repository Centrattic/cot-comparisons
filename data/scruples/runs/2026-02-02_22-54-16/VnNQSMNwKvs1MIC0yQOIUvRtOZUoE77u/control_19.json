There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a talent competition where the author judged a contestant with a disability and gave them a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was a judge, presumably with expertise in music. They gave the contestant with a disability a 7/100, which they felt was deserved because the performance was poor. However, the other judges and the crowd reacted negatively, leading to the author being pressured to retract their judgment.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is whether it's wrong to judge a person with a disability based solely on their performance, especially in a competition. The author argues that they were being honest and following their professional standards. However, there's a possibility that the author's judgment was influenced by unconscious bias or a lack of consideration for the contestant's circumstances. \n\nBut in a competition, the standard is usually based on skill and performance, regardless of the participant's background or disabilities. If the contestant's performance was objectively worse, then the low score might be justified. However, the situation might also involve factors like the crowd's reaction and the organizers' pressure, which could indicate that the competition wasn't purely merit-based. \n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole for being honest but weren't wrong in their assessment. The conflict arises between the author's belief in merit and the societal tendency to reward perseverance or inspiration over skill, especially in cases involving disabilities. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize skill over inspiration? Competitions are meant to reward the best performance, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way the situation was handled\u2014publicly causing embarrassment and being confrontational\u2014might have been insensitive. But the core issue is whether the judgment itself was wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for judging based on performance, but maybe the execution could have been handled better. However, since the question is about whether they're in the wrong for the judgment itself, the answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure there's no discrimination involved. If the disability wasn't a factor in the scoring, then it's okay. The author didn't mention giving a lower score because of the disability, but because of poor performance. So, the answer is B.\n"
