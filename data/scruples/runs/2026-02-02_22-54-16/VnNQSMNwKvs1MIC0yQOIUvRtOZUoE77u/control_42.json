There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was a judge in a talent competition for teenagers. One of the contestants is in a wheelchair, and the author gave him a very low score, which led to some backlash from the audience and the contestant's mother. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is a music professional with experience, and they believe in awarding the competition based on talent. The contestant with the disability, Ryan, performed poorly but received a lot of audience support, leading to the crowd's reaction when he didn't win. The author gave him a low score, which caused conflict.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author was wrong to score Ryan based on his performance. On one hand, the author's role as a judge is to evaluate talent and skill. If Ryan's performance was objectively worse, then the author's decision could be justified. But on the other hand, there's the consideration of the contestant's disability and the social dynamics at play. The story mentions that Ryan tried his best, struggled during the performance, and the audience rallied around him. The mother's reaction suggests that they might have felt the competition wasn't fair, possibly due to their son's disability.\n\nI should also think about the intent. Did the author have any bias against people with disabilities? The author claims they just gave honest scores based on the performance. However, if the low score was solely based on the performance regardless of the contestant's situation, that's one thing. But if there's an underlying assumption that people with disabilities shouldn't be in such competitions or that their participation is for show, that's another issue.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness of the competition. The audience's reaction indicates that they valued effort and perseverance over technical skill. The author's strict adherence to talent might clash with the event's purpose if it's meant to be inclusive and supportive, regardless of the outcome. The organizer forced the author to retract their decision, which might have been a conflict between objective judging and the event's social goals.\n\nAlso, the author's friends said they're not wrong but an asshole, implying that while the action was justified, the manner might have been harsh. However, the author's explanation to Ryan's mom was direct, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to judge purely on skill in a competition where participants might be there for personal growth rather than winning? Competitions are supposed to reward talent, but sometimes there's a balance between that and encouraging participation, especially for those with challenges.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for scoring based on the performance. However, there's a nuance here. The story doesn't indicate that the author was biased against the contestant's disability. The issue might be more about the competition's intent and the audience's perception. If the event was meant to be a platform for showcasing effort and overcoming obstacles, then the author's strict evaluation might conflict with that. But if it's a standard competition for musical talent, then the author's actions are appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they judged based on the performance criteria, and there's no evidence of discriminatory intent. However, there's a possible oversight in considering the event's broader goals, but the author's primary duty as a judge is to assess the talent as presented.\n"
