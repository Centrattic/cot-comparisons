There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was a judge in a talent competition where one of the participants had a disability. The author gave a very low score to the kid with a disability because they felt his performance was bad, but the crowd and the other judges didn't agree, leading to a lot of backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the judges are supposed to evaluate based on talent and skill, then the author's low score might be justified. The author is experienced in music, so their opinion could carry weight. But then again, maybe the competition had a different focus, like effort or inspiration, which the crowd seemed to value more. The crowd was cheering for the kid with the disability even though the performance wasn't technically good. The organizers might have prioritized the message of perseverance over skill, which could be a hidden aspect of the competition.\n\nAlso, the fact that the other judges were shocked by the low score suggests they might have scored the kid higher, perhaps considering the emotional aspect. The author's decision might have not aligned with the competition's intended values. Even if the author believed they were being fair, if the competition's criteria included more than just technical skill, then the author's judgment might be seen as missing the point.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's reaction and the subsequent pressure on the organizer to change the results. The author was asked to retract their judgment, which implies that the low score was the reason for the controversy. If the competition was meant to be a platform for inspiring stories as well as talent, the author might have overlooked that aspect, leading to a conflict between their personal standards and the event's broader goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to be honest and fair based on their expertise. They didn't have malicious intent, just a different evaluation standard. But in a public setting, especially with a contestant who has a disability, there might be an expectation to consider more than just technical skill. The author might not be in the wrong for grading based on their expertise, but the situation highlights a clash between different values\u2014technical excellence versus inspirational effort.\n\nSo, the key points are: the competition's criteria, the role of the judges, and societal expectations regarding disability and inspiration. If the competition's rules emphasized technical skill, the author is not wrong. If the criteria included inspiration or effort, then the author's judgment was out of line. Since the author was a professional, their assessment might be valid, but the fallout suggests that the event's goals weren't purely about skill. The organizers might have expected judges to balance technical and inspirational aspects.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't adhere to the competition's intended values, even if their personal judgment was based on expertise. The key is whether the competition was about pure talent or had a broader purpose. The fact that the other judges didn't share the author's low score and the crowd's reaction implies that the author's strict technical evaluation wasn't in line with the event's expectations. Hence, the author's actions, while honest, might have been inappropriate given the context.\n"
