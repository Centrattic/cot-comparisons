There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. First, I need to understand all the details.\n\nThe author was a judge, and one of the contestants, Ryan, is in a wheelchair. The author is a professional musician, so their judgment might be based on skill. Ryan's performance was terrible, according to the author, but the audience loved him because of his perseverance. The author gave him a 7/100, which led to a backlash. The organizers made the author apologize and change the result, which caused more conflict.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the ethics of judging based purely on skill versus considering other factors like the contestant's circumstances. The author believes in merit, but the audience and others valued effort and inspiration. However, the fact that Ryan has a disability might complicate things. Was the author biased against someone with a disability? Did they consider that Ryan might have faced more challenges in learning to play?\n\nAlso, the reaction of the audience and the organizers suggests that there's a societal expectation to reward perseverance and inspiration, even if the technical skill isn't there. The author might be seen as not considering the broader context of the competition's purpose. If the competition is meant to celebrate talent, then the author is right. But if it's also about inspiration, maybe they missed that point.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the competition's sponsor is a music school. So the scholarship is practical. Maybe the organizers wanted to attract attention by having an inspiring story, which could be good for their image. The author's strict adherence to skill might have clashed with that. Also, there's the issue of the author's harsh score. Even if Ryan's performance was bad, the 7/100 seems extremely low. Maybe the author took it too far, being overly critical instead of giving a middling score that reflects effort but still acknowledges lack of skill.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends called them an asshole but not wrong. That's a split\u2014right action, bad attitude. But does that hold up? If the author judged based on skill, which is their role, they aren't wrong. But maybe they failed to consider the environment and the organizers' goals, or perhaps the disability aspect made them seem insensitive.\n\nAlso, Ryan's mom's reaction might indicate that the author's judgment caused emotional harm. Even if the author thought they were right, the fallout was negative. Did the author have a responsibility to consider the impact beyond just technical merit?\n\nI think there's a balance between fairness and compassion. Competitions are supposed to be fair, so the author isn't wrong in a strict sense. But if the competition also values inspiration, the author might have missed that. Additionally, the author's public criticism might have embarrassed Ryan, which could be seen as harsh. However, the author isn't in the wrong for scoring based on skill alone. The problem might be in the score's severity and the subsequent handling of the situation, not the initial judgment itself.\n"
