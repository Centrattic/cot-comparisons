There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author, who is a music professional, judged a competition. There were three finalists, one of whom was in a wheelchair. The author gave the wheelchair user, Ryan, a very low score (7/100) because they felt he played poorly, but the crowd and others seemed to support Ryan, leading to a last-minute change in the winner.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions and the context. The author is a professional with experience, so they might believe their judgment is valid. However, the problem arises because the competition's outcome was influenced not just by skill but also by the audience's emotional response. \n\nThe author gave Ryan a 7/100, which is extremely low. Even if the author honestly thought Ryan wasn't skilled, scoring that low could be seen as harsh, especially when others, like the other judges, didn't agree. The crowd's reaction and the mom's confrontation suggest that the author's judgment was out of step with the expectations of the event, which might prioritize participation, effort, or inspiring stories over pure talent in some cases. \n\nAlso, the organizer forced the author to retract their judgment, leading to the real winner being stripped of the title. This could be seen as the author sticking to their principles, but the problem is whether they should have considered the event's purpose beyond just musical skill. Competitions can sometimes have elements of encouragement and recognition of perseverance, which the crowd was applauding. \n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole for doing the right thing, which is a bit confusing. But maybe the issue is that the author didn't consider the broader context of the competition. It's possible that the event wasn't purely about musical excellence but also about promoting inclusivity or inspiring stories. In that case, the author's strict adherence to technical skill might have been inappropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the way the author handled the situation\u2014being confrontational when challenged\u2014could have contributed to the tension. Even if they believed they were right, the manner in which they defended their decision might have been insensitive, especially given Ryan's disability. The mom's aggressive reaction suggests that the author's judgment was perceived as disrespectful or dismissive of Ryan's efforts and challenges.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be at fault for not taking into account the event's potential goals beyond pure performance, and for their rigid stance despite the social and emotional impact of their decision. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
