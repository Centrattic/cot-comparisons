There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a talent competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author, as a judge, gave a very low score to the kid in a wheelchair, which led to a lot of backlash from the crowd and the mom. The author's friends say he's not wrong but call him an asshole for doing what he thought was right. So, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that the kid with the disability didn't perform well, and he gave a low score based on the performance. The author has experience in music, so maybe he's qualified to judge. But the crowd and the organizers didn't like that. The problem here might be that the author didn't consider the context beyond just the performance. The kid had a disability, and maybe the competition's intention was to celebrate effort and perseverance, not just pure talent. \n\nAlso, when the author's low score caused the crowd to boo the actual deserving winner, that's a problem. The crowd was cheering for the kid with the disability not just because of his performance but because he kept trying after a mistake and showed resilience. The author might have overlooked the emotional and motivational aspects that the organizers and audience valued. \n\nThen there's the part where the organizers made the author publicly retract his decision, which led to embarrassment for everyone involved. The author stood by his judgment but didn't anticipate the social dynamics. The mom's reaction was harsh, but the author's response was direct and honest, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, judging based on performance is fair, but there might be an expectation in such events to support participants with disabilities, even if their performance isn't the best. The author's friends say he's not wrong, but society often values inclusivity and encouragement over strict merit in these contexts. So, while the author wasn't wrong in his judgment based on skill, he might have failed to consider the broader purpose of the competition, which could have been to inspire and support rather than just to select the most talented. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the competition prioritized talent over inclusivity. If it's a standard competition, the author isn't wrong. If it's meant to be inclusive and uplifting, then maybe he was. But the story mentions that the competition was sponsored by a music school, so maybe it's supposed to be about merit. However, the crowd's reaction suggests that the organizers didn't expect a strict merit-based decision. The author's actions caused a rift, so maybe he's in the wrong for not aligning with the event's implied values. So, probably answer A.\n"
