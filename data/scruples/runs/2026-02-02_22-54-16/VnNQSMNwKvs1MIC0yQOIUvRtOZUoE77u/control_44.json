There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a talent competition where the author was a judge. There were three contestants, one of whom had a disability (Ryan). The author gave Ryan a very low score because he thought his performance was terrible, but the crowd and other judges didn't agree, leading to chaos. The organizer made the author retract his judgment, which was then changed. The author ended up in a confrontation with Ryan's mom.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they judged based on talent. They mention their own experience in music, so they believe they were qualified to assess the performances. Ryan's performance was bad, according to the author. But the crowd and others were moved by Ryan's effort and perseverance. This raises the question: should a competition be judged strictly on skill, or should other factors like effort and overcoming adversity be considered?\n\nThe author argues that they did the right thing by being honest about the talent. But competitions, especially for young people, sometimes have a balance between skill and being encouraging. However, talent shows typically prioritize skill. Still, there might be an expectation to consider the contestant's circumstances. The author's low score might be seen as harsh but technically correct if the performance was objectively worse. However, the way it played out led to a negative outcome for the deserving winner and the crowd's reaction suggests a disconnect between the author's perception and the public's view.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the participants. The first contestant who worked hard was booed because the outcome was changed. This could be unfair to them. The author's actions led to a situation where the initial winner lost their prize, and the trophy was given to someone who didn't perform as well. The author might be seen as causing unnecessary conflict by being too rigid. But if the competition's main goal is to reward the most talented, then the author's judgment is justified.\n\nAlso, the author was a student judge dealing with adults, which might have added to the pressure. They felt torn between their honest assessment and the crowd's reaction. The organizer's demand to retract the judgment could have been unfair, but the author complied under pressure. However, the aftermath shows that the author's initial judgment was correct in terms of skill, but perhaps the situation required more nuance.\n\nThe key here is whether the competition's purpose is strictly talent-based. If so, the author isn't in the wrong. If the goal includes recognizing effort or inspiring stories, then the author might be considered harsh. The fact that Ryan's mom was confrontational and the crowd's reaction were emotional factors that the author didn't anticipate. But as a judge, the author's role is to evaluate based on set criteria. The problem is that the author's strict adherence to talent caused a negative outcome for the other contestant and led to public backlash. However, the author's intentions were to be fair and honest, even if the consequences were unintended.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on their professional judgment, but the situation highlights a conflict between objective skill assessment and subjective emotional factors. Depending on the competition's stated goals, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way the situation unfolded, causing a deserving winner to lose and creating a hostile environment, could mean the author didn't consider the broader impact, making them partially at fault. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the competition's criteria prioritize talent above all else. If they do, then the author isn't wrong. If not, they are.\n"
