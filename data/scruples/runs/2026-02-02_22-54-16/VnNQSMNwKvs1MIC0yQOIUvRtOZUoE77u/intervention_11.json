There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a music competition where the author, as a judge, gave a low score to a kid with a disability, leading to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The author was a judge, and they felt that one of the competitors, Ryan, a wheelchair user, played very poorly. The other two judges gave higher scores, and the crowd's reaction was to cheer for Ryan even when he changed his piece. The author's low score caused the winner to be the first guy, but the crowd booed, and then the organizers had to switch the result. Ryan's mom was confrontational, and the author ended up feeling targeted.\n\nThe main issue here is whether being honest about a contestant's performance is wrong, even if that contestant has a disability. The author argues that they gave the score based on merit, while others felt the author was being an \"asshole\" for not considering the circumstances. \n\nI need to consider the ethics of judging. Competitions are supposed to be merit-based, right? So if the author is a professional in music, their judgment should be about the quality of the performance. However, the situation is complicated by the disability aspect and the emotional response from the audience and parents. \n\nBut wait, is it possible that the author didn't take into account the challenges Ryan might have faced because of his disability? For example, maybe Ryan's performance was affected by his physical limitations, or he might have had a tough time preparing. The author mentions that Ryan was crying and changed his piece, which could indicate some level of stress or difficulty. But the author insists that even the low score is generous. \n\nOn the other hand, the crowd and the other judges were influenced by the emotional aspect\u2014cheering for someone who was trying despite the disability. The organizers then felt pressured to change the result, which might imply that the original decision wasn't just based on merit. \n\nThe author's friends say they did the right thing but are mean-spirited. The question is if being honest, even when it's uncomfortable, is the right approach. However, in such competitions, the rules should be clear that it's about talent. If the author followed the guidelines and judged based solely on performance, then maybe they're in the right. But if there's an unspoken expectation to consider the contestant's circumstances (like disability), then the author's strict merit-based judgment might be seen as harsh or insensitive.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author had to publicly recant their judgment and the winner was changed could suggest that the author's approach disrupted the intended spirit of the competition, which might have been to encourage and support all participants, especially those with disabilities. Even if the author is technically correct in their assessment, the outcome led to embarrassment and possibly unfair treatment of the deserving winner who was booed.\n\nSo, the dilemma is between strict merit and compassion. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but others might argue that the author's inflexibility caused harm. The answer might depend on the competition's stated criteria. If it's purely about musical skill, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if there's an element of encouragement or recognizing effort despite challenges, then the author might be seen as not following the competition's purpose.\n\nIn the end, the author's decision to not adjust their score could be ethically justified if the competition's rules emphasize talent over other factors. However, the way the situation unfolded\u2014especially the organizers forcing a correction and the public backlash\u2014might indicate that the author's approach wasn't in line with the event's expectations. So, a possible answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the broader context of the competition and the impact of their judgment on the contestant and audience.\n"
