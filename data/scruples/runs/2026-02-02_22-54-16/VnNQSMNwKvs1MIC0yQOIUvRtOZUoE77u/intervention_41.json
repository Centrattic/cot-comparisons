There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves judging a talent competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author gave a very low score to the disabled contestant, leading to crowd backlash and a subsequent reversal of the results.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a judge with professional experience. They believe they're judging based on talent and performance. The contestant with the disability, Ryan, performed poorly and even changed his piece mid-performance. The crowd and other judges were in favor of Ryan, possibly due to sympathy for his disability.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the author was wrong in scoring Ryan based on his actual performance, regardless of his disability. The author argues that talent should be the basis, but others might argue that the context of a competition that might value perseverance or inclusivity over pure skill. However, competitions are typically supposed to be judged on the criteria set, which in this case seems to be musical ability.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of disability. The story mentions that Ryan is on a wheelchair, which might affect his ability to perform. However, the author states that Ryan's performance was not just below average but extremely poor, worse than someone without experience. The act of changing pieces and the crowd's reaction might indicate they valued effort over skill. The author's decision could be seen as sticking to the competition's standards, but others might see it as insensitive if the competition's intent was to encourage participation and inclusivity rather than strict talent evaluation.\n\nThe aftermath, where the organizers forced the author to reverse the decision and give the win to Ryan despite his low score, adds another layer. The author felt pressured to compromise their judgment, which might be a criticism of the organizers' actions, but the original question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the competition had a clear set of criteria, the author's assessment should be based on those. However, if the competition's purpose was to promote inclusivity and support for disabled participants, then the author's strict scoring might be seen as missing the point. The crowd's reaction and the organizers' intervention suggest that the community valued emotional support over rigid talent assessment.\n\nIn terms of disability rights, it's important to note that people with disabilities deserve opportunities, but the evaluation should be fair. However, if the competition is meant to be a genuine talent showcase, then the author's actions might be justified. But if the competition's goal is to encourage participation and morale, then the author's low score could be seen as undermining that purpose.\n\nThe author's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole for being honest. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. If the competition's rules were clear and the author followed them, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the competition's intent was to celebrate participation and effort, especially considering the participant's disability, then the author might be at fault for not considering the broader context.\n\nBut the author did consider the performance's quality and gave a low score based on that. The problem might lie in the fact that the competition's structure didn't account for different abilities or that the organizers didn't set clear expectations. The author's actions were based on their expertise, but the situation highlights a conflict between strict talent evaluation and inclusive values.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the competition's stated goals. If it was purely about talent, the author is justified. If it was about inclusivity and support, then they might be in the wrong. Since the story doesn't clarify the competition's intent beyond the cash prize and scholarship, the answer hinges on standard competition practices, which prioritize talent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
