There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the story is about a music competition where they were a judge. There were three contestants, one of whom was in a wheelchair. The writer gave the disabled contestant a very low score, and the crowd didn't like it. The other judges were shocked by the low score, and the crowd started booing the actual winner. The organizer made the writer apologize and the award was given to the disabled contestant, even though he wasn't the best performer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main question is whether being honest about the talent is more important than showing compassion for someone with a disability. The writer argues that they were just being truthful in their judgment, but others, including the crowd and the organizer, felt that they should have been more considerate.\n\nIn a competition, the purpose is to evaluate skill and performance. If the judges are supposed to score based on talent, then the writer's action is justified. However, competitions also have a social aspect. Sometimes, there's an emphasis on participation, encouraging people, or recognizing effort beyond just technical skill. The writer might have failed to consider that the competition's environment included factors like audience reaction and the emotional impact on a contestant with a disability.\n\nAnother angle is the disability aspect. The disabled contestant might have faced more challenges, so the crowd's support is about celebrating perseverance rather than just musical talent. The writer's strict adherence to musical standards could be seen as missing the point of inclusivity and support that the event intended.\n\nBut then, the organizer and other judges might have felt pressured by the crowd and the mother, leading the writer to be scapegoated. However, the writer's choice to give such a low score in the first place, without considering the broader context, could be seen as lacking empathy. The fact that the other judges didn't support the writer suggests that maybe the score was too harsh, even if the performance was poor.\n\nThe writer's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole, which implies that while the action was honest, the approach might have been insensitive. The key here is whether the competition's rules emphasized pure talent or a more holistic evaluation. If it's the former, then the writer isn't wrong. If the latter, they might be. But in most talent shows, especially those aimed at youth, there's often a balance between technical skill and the contestant's effort and story.\n\nAlso, the writer might not have considered how their harsh judgment could affect the contestant's self-esteem, even if they were being fair. The mother's reaction, while extreme, might have been a result of feeling that her child was being unfairly judged. The writer's direct and unfiltered assessment might not have taken into account the emotional stakes for the family.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intent was to be honest, the situation might require a more nuanced approach, considering both talent and the broader impact on participants. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for not balancing judgment with compassion.\n"
