There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a music competition where the author judged a contestant with a disability and gave them a very low score, leading to controversy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is a judge in a talent competition. There are three contestants: one with a disability (Ryan) who performed poorly but received a lot of crowd support, another who played well, and a third. The author gave Ryan a 7/100, which the other judges apparently found shockingly low. The crowd booed the actual winner, leading to pressure to change the results, and the author was forced to publicly recant their judgment.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is about fairness and the role of a judge. Judges are supposed to assess talent and skill objectively. The author claims they gave Ryan a low score because his performance was objectively bad. But the crowd and others valued effort and perseverance, especially considering Ryan's disability. \n\nThe author's defense is that they judged based on merit, but the problem arises when their judgment leads to public backlash and a change in the results. Even if the author believed Ryan didn't deserve to win, the situation raises questions about whether they considered the broader context, such as the intent of the competition. If the competition aimed to celebrate perseverance or inclusivity, then the author's strict technical judgment might be at odds with those values. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to a deserving winner being stripped of their victory. The crowd's reaction suggests that the community valued Ryan's effort and his story over technical skill. The author's refusal to adjust their score initially, despite the other judges' reactions, might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of the event's purpose beyond just technical merit.\n\nHowever, the author also argues that they were following their professional judgment. But in competitions, especially those involving vulnerable participants, there's often an emphasis on encouragement and inclusivity. The fact that the organizer and others felt compelled to change the outcome shows that the author's strict scoring clashed with the event's goals.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in not considering the competition's broader aims and the emotional impact of their judgment. While the author believes they were right to judge based on skill, the negative consequences and the context of the event suggest that they were in the wrong for not balancing technical skill with the event's values of support and encouragement, especially for someone with a disability.\n"
