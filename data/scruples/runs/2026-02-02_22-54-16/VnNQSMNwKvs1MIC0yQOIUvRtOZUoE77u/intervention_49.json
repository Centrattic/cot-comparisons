There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to the kid with a disability in the talent competition. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was a judge in a music competition. The three finalists included a kid in a wheelchair named Ryan. The author gave Ryan a 7/100 because they felt his performance was really bad\u2014cringey, he forgot the piece, and switched to \"Don't Stop Believing\" with just chords, not the melody. The other two judges were surprised by the low score. The crowd booed the actual deserving winner and cheered for Ryan, leading to the organizer making the author admit a mistake and changing the winner to Ryan. The author felt pressured to do this and later had a confrontation with Ryan's mom.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness, disability, and the role of a judge. The author claims they judged based on talent, which is their duty. However, the situation involves a contestant with a disability, which might raise questions about whether there's an implicit bias or if the author should have considered other factors beyond performance skill.\n\nOn one hand, judges are supposed to assess based on the talent and the performance. If Ryan's performance was objectively worse, the author's responsibility is to score honestly. But on the other hand, there's the aspect of the crowd's reaction and possible sympathy votes for someone with a disability. The author might be seen as being too strict or insensitive to the emotional dynamics of the situation.\n\nBut wait, the author did give a score based on their professional opinion. The problem arises when the other judges and the organizer overruled the author's opinion due to external pressures. The author didn't force the decision; they were compelled to retract their judgment under the organizer's directive. The author's stance was that they did the right thing by judging based on merit, but the aftermath was uncomfortable and possibly hurtful to Ryan and his family.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong for scoring honestly. If the author's job was to judge purely on talent, then they weren't wrong. However, if the competition had criteria that included other factors like overcoming adversity, then maybe the author didn't consider that. But the author didn't mention such criteria in the story. They emphasize that Ryan's performance was worse than someone who never played, which is a strong statement about the quality.\n\nThe other judges didn't agree with the author's low score, suggesting that there might be some subjectivity in judging. However, the author's personal experience as a musician might make their assessment valid. The main issue here is the conflict between strict technical evaluation versus empathetic consideration for a contestant with a disability.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit tricky. The author's actions were based on their professional judgment, but the outcome caused emotional distress and possibly reinforced a negative stereotype about people with disabilities not being as talented. However, the author didn't have ill intent; they believed they were being fair. The real problem might be with the competition's structure or the organizers who prioritized crowd reaction over objective judging.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for their initial scoring but could have failed to address the situation gracefully, leading to a confrontational ending. But the core question is whether the scoring was wrong. If the competition's rules were strictly about musical performance, then the author did their job correctly. The error might have been in the organizers' decision to override the scores based on crowd sentiment rather than the author's initial judgment.\n"
