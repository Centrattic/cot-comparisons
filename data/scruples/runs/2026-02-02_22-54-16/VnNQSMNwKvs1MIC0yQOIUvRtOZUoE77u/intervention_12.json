There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author, an experienced musician, was a judge. One of the contestants, Ryan, who uses a wheelchair, performed poorly. The author gave him a very low score, which led to some backlash from the crowd and Ryan's mom. The other judges were surprised by the low score, and eventually, the organizers had to change the winner to avoid further conflict. The author is now asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is whether it was wrong to judge a contestant with a disability based solely on their performance, especially when the crowd and others were swayed by the emotional aspect of the situation. The author's argument is that they did what was right by being honest and fair, while others argue that the author was heartless for not considering the disability.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The author has a background in music, which gives them credibility as a judge. They felt that Ryan's performance was subpar and didn't deserve the prize. The problem arises when the crowd and organizers decided to prioritize the emotional impact (supporting someone with a disability) over the actual talent. \n\nBut is it ethical to judge a person with a disability differently? The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that people with disabilities are not discriminated against, but in a competition, the criteria should be about performance, not disability status. So, if the competition is based on talent, then the author is supposed to evaluate based on that, regardless of the contestant's ability. However, the controversy here is the author's low score, which was so low that others were shocked. \n\nThe user's friends said they're not wrong but just an asshole, implying that the author's actions were justified but unkind. The author's stance is that they did what was right by the rules, but the social consequences were negative. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the competition might have a hidden agenda to promote inclusivity, and the author's strict adherence to talent over inclusivity could be seen as insensitive. Also, the fact that Ryan's mom and the crowd were swayed by emotion suggests that the competition's purpose might have been to recognize effort and perseverance, not just technical skill. \n\nBut from a strict competition standpoint, the rules should be clear. If the competition is purely based on talent, then the author is in the right. However, if the competition also values other factors like perseverance or inclusivity, then the author's approach might be seen as missing the point. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the other contestant. The first guy who practiced a lot was booed, which is unfair. The author's honest scoring led to this, which might be seen as a negative consequence. However, the author had no control over the crowd's reaction. \n\nIn the end, the organizers forced the author to retract their decision, which might imply that the competition's organizers valued public perception over objective scoring. But the author's responsibility as a judge is to be honest, even if it's unpopular. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were based on their professional judgment, which is their duty as a judge. However, the social and emotional aspects of the situation might make people perceive the author as harsh. But legally and ethically, if the competition is about talent, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
