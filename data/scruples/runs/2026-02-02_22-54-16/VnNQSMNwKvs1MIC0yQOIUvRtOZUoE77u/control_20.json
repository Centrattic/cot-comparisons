There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scoring a disabled contestant so low that it caused controversy. The situation is a talent competition where the author, a judge with music experience, gave a very low score to a contestant in a wheelchair, leading to the crowd and other judges being upset.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that they judged based on talent and performance. They mention that the contestant (Ryan) played poorly, changed his piece mid-performance, and didn't deserve the high scores others gave. The author's high scores for the other contestants suggest they believed in their merit. However, the crowd and others reacted negatively, cheering for Ryan despite his performance.\n\nNow, considering the disability aspect. The key point here is whether the author's judgment was fair or if they overlooked Ryan's disability. Competitions are meant to assess skill, but there's also the ethical angle of whether accommodations were made or if the competition's purpose was to encourage participation over pure talent. The author might not have considered that the competition's intent could be to support and uplift participants, especially those with disabilities, rather than strictly evaluating technical skill.\n\nAlso, the crowd's reaction and Ryan's mother's confrontation suggest that there was an emotional component. The crowd cheered for Ryan's effort, which might indicate that the competition values perseverance and participation. The author's harsh score might have clashed with that expectation. Even if the author's assessment was technically accurate, not considering the broader context of the competition's purpose could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role as a judge. Judges are supposed to be impartial, but in this case, the author's low score led to a forced change in the winner, causing embarrassment to the deserving contestant. The organizer made the author publicly retract their decision, which undermines the integrity of the judging process. The author's initial refusal to comply with the crowd's and organizers' pressure might be seen as standing by their principles, but the subsequent forced change highlights the conflict between objective evaluation and subjective emotional responses.\n\nHowever, the author's friends called them an \"asshole\" but not entirely wrong. The question is whether they were wrong for sticking to their judgment. In a talent competition, fairness in evaluation is crucial. If the rules state that talent is the only criterion, then the author is correct. But if there's an unspoken understanding to support participants regardless of skill, especially those with disabilities, then the author might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's actions led to negative consequences, including the deserving winner being booed and the author being publicly forced to correct their judgment. The confrontation with Ryan's mom adds another layer of conflict. Despite the author's intent to be fair, the outcome was harmful to others involved. Ethically, it's about balancing truth with compassion. Even if technically correct, causing distress and undermining the competition's spirit could make the author at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's assessment might be technically valid, the context of the competition's purpose, the emotional impact on participants and audience, and the resulting conflict suggest that the author might be in the wrong for not considering these factors. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
