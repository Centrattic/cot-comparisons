There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were a judge in a music competition, and one of the contestants is in a wheelchair. The author gave this contestant a very low score, which led to a lot of backlash from the audience and the contestant's mom. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of a judge. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on the performance, right? The author is a professional musician and a former runner-up, so they might have the expertise to assess the talent accurately. If the contestant's performance was really bad, maybe the low score is justified.\n\nBut wait, there's a contestant with a disability. The story mentions that the kid had a hard time during the performance, forgot the piece, and the audience cheered for him. The crowd's reaction might have been influenced by sympathy or admiration for overcoming challenges. The author's strict judging based purely on technical skill could clash with the crowd's emotional support for the underdog.\n\nBut the problem is that the author's score was so low (7/100) that it caused controversy. Even if the author felt the performance was bad, maybe they should have considered the competition's context. Was this a talent show that values not just technical skill but also heart or perseverance? Or was it strictly a skills-based competition?\n\nAlso, the organizer made the author admit they were wrong and had to switch the winner. The author might feel they were doing the right thing by being honest, but the situation led to negative consequences. The question is whether being honest about the scores is more important than the social implications, especially when the contestant has a disability.\n\nAnother angle: the author is an undergraduate student, so maybe they were overruled by more experienced judges or organizers. But the other judges didn't want to get involved, so the author was the one who stood by their judgment. However, the crowd's and the contestant's mother's reactions suggest that there was an expectation of being kind or accommodating to a person with a disability.\n\nIs it fair to judge a person with a disability more harshly? The author might argue that they were just being objective, but the others might see it as insensitive. The disability doesn't excuse a poor performance, but perhaps the expectations should be adjusted. Maybe the competition's criteria didn't account for the challenges the contestant faced.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the author had to publicly retract their decision, which might imply that the organizers felt the low score was inappropriate, even if the author believed it was correct. The contestant's mother's confrontational behavior adds another layer, but the author's response was direct, which the friends called them an asshole for being honest.\n\nSo, the key points are: the duty of a judge to be fair vs. the social dynamics of sympathy for a disabled contestant. The author's stance is that they did the right thing by judging purely on merit, but others see it as being harsh or insensitive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the competition's rules are clear that it's based on skill, then the author wasn't wrong. But if the competition also values other factors like perseverance or the contestant's story, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering those aspects. However, the author's friends and the crowd's reaction suggest that the community values the underdog story more than technical skill in this context.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the competition's criteria. If it's purely technical, the author is not in the wrong. If it's more holistic, they might be. But since the author was a professional and the competition was for a music school scholarship, it's likely that technical skill is the main criteria. However, the author's extreme low score and the resulting fallout might indicate a failure to consider the broader context of the event, which included audience and emotional elements. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not balancing technical judgment with the event's possible values of encouraging participants, especially those with disabilities. But others might argue they were just doing their job. It's a bit of a gray area. But given the user's own thought that they think the author isn't in the wrong, but the friends called them an asshole, the answer might be B (No), but there's a strong case for A as well. However, considering the public backlash and the organizer's actions, maybe the author is in the wrong. I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
