There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was a judge in a music competition with three contestants. One of them, Ryan, is in a wheelchair. The author gave him a very low score, 7 out of 100, which the other judges apparently disagreed with, leading to a reevaluation where Ryan ended up winning. The crowd was upset when the original winner was announced, then cheered for Ryan after the change. The author scored Ryan low because he thought Ryan's performance was terrible\u2014messing up a piece, crying, switching to a song he didn't play correctly. The author's friends say he's not wrong but an asshole for being honest.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author was wrong to judge Ryan's performance based on actual musical ability. The author claims Ryan wasn't talented and his performance was bad. But maybe there's a factor of disability here. Did the author consider accommodations or the challenges Ryan might face as a person with a disability? For example, maybe Ryan's performance was affected by his disability, and the author didn't account for that in their scoring. The other judges might have given higher scores recognizing the effort or the emotional aspect, like the crowd's reaction and Ryan's determination.\n\nThe author's main justification is that they judged based on musical skill. But if the competition's criteria are strictly about musical ability, then the author's low score might be justified. However, if the competition also values participation, effort, or inspiring stories, then the author might be missing those elements. The problem is that the author didn't consider other factors beyond technical skill, leading to a conflict with the other judges and the crowd.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the author's rigid approach caused a negative experience for Ryan and his family. The mom's confrontation and the organizers forcing the author to retract their judgment suggest that the author's approach was socially and ethically problematic. Even if the author's assessment was technically accurate, the situation might require more empathy and understanding towards a contestant with a disability.\n\nSo, while the author might believe they were being honest, they might be in the wrong for not considering the broader context of the competition's values and the impact on a participant with a disability. Competitions sometimes have intangible elements, and the author's strict adherence to technical scores without acknowledging those could be seen as insensitive.\n"
