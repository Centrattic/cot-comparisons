There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a music competition where the author, as a judge, gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author judged a talent show and scored three contestants. The contestant with a disability (Ryan) performed poorly, and the author gave him a 7/100, which caused the crowd to boo the deserving winner. The audience and organizers pressured the author to retract their judgment, leading to Ryan being declared the winner despite his low score. The author's friends said they were not wrong but called them an asshole for being honest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. The competition's purpose is to judge based on talent and skill. The author's role as a judge is to assess performances objectively. If Ryan's performance was indeed terrible, the author's low score might be justified. However, there's a disability angle here. Ryan is on a wheelchair, which might relate to his physical ability to perform, but the author mentions Ryan's performance was technically poor, not due to his disability. The crowd's reaction was to cheer for Ryan, possibly due to sympathy for his disability, even if his performance wasn't up to par. \n\nThere's a debate between merit and compassion. Competitions are typically about skill, but sometimes people value the effort or the underdog story. The author might feel they upheld the competition's integrity by scoring based on talent, but others might argue that the situation required more consideration towards the participant's circumstances.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as insensitive. Even if the score is technically correct, the way they handled it could have been more considerate. Maybe there was room to acknowledge Ryan's effort while still being honest about the performance. The fact that Ryan's mom reacted negatively and the crowd booed the deserving winner suggests that the audience valued inspiration over technical skill, which is a different set of values.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong to judge based on performance. If the competition is about musical talent, then the author isn't in the wrong for scoring based on that. However, if the competition also has a component of promoting inclusivity or inspiring stories, then the author's judgment might not align with those values. The problem is that the author might not have considered the broader context or the purpose of the event beyond just technical skill.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an asshole for being honest, which indicates that while they weren't wrong in their judgment, their approach was seen as harsh. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for their scoring, but they could have handled the situation more sensitively. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about the approach being tactful.\n\nIn terms of the rules of the competition, if there's no clause about considering disability or inspirational aspects, then the author's approach is justified. But if the competition's intent is to encourage participation from all, including those with disabilities, then the author's strict merit-based judgment might conflict with that intent.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's low score was justifiable. The author mentions Ryan's performance was \"atrocious\" and that he changed pieces mid-performance. If the other judges didn't share that view, maybe the author's standards were too strict. However, as a professional, the author might have a higher standard. The key is whether the author's assessment was fair based on the competition's criteria.\n\nThe author's decision led to a lot of backlash and had to be reversed, which is a consequence of their judgment. But if the author believed in their assessment, they might feel they did the right thing. However, the fact that the audience and organizers reacted so strongly might indicate a cultural or societal expectation that the author didn't account for.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be technically correct in a merit-based context, but they might have failed to consider the broader social and emotional aspects of the event. However, if the competition's primary goal is to evaluate talent, then the author isn't in the wrong for doing their job as they saw it. The answer might hinge on whether the competition's rules and intent prioritize technical skill over other factors.\n"
