There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author was a judge in a talent competition where one of the contestants is disabled. The author gave a very low score to the disabled contestant, leading to crowd backlash and the organizer forcing the author to retract their judgment. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author judged based on performance, which they argue is their professional opinion. Ryan, the disabled contestant, performed poorly, and the author felt he didn't deserve a high score. But there's a crowd that's cheering for Ryan despite his performance, and the author faces criticism for being harsh.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are fairness, respect for the contestant, and the role of a judge. Judges are expected to evaluate performances objectively based on talent and skill. The author did that, but the problem might be in how they handled it. However, the crowd and the organizers might have had other priorities, like promoting inclusivity or recognizing effort over skill. \n\nRyan's disability adds another layer. Even if his performance wasn't great, the crowd and his mom were emphasizing his effort and perseverance. The author might be seen as not valuing those qualities, which are important in certain contexts. But as a judge, their job is to assess talent, not just effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's low score was so extreme (7 out of 100) that it could be seen as overly harsh, especially when Ryan showed vulnerability by crying and switching songs. The author's insistence on their own judgment despite the emotional impact might come off as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling bad later and being forced to retract their decision, which suggests that maybe their initial judgment was too rigid. The organizers and other judges valued the crowd's reaction, which might be part of the competition's goals beyond just technical skill. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the competition's criteria. If the competition was strictly about musical skill, the author did their job. But if there were other factors, like audience engagement or inclusivity, then the author might have overlooked those. However, the author's explanation that they didn't act out of malice but based on skill could be a defense. \n\nThe key here is the balance between objective assessment and compassion. The author might be in the right for sticking to their evaluation but in the wrong for not considering the broader context of the competition's purpose and the emotional aspects. The fact that the organizer forced a change suggests that there were other priorities at play. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the event's intent to celebrate perseverance and inclusivity, which is important in contexts involving vulnerable participants. Their strict adherence to technical skill without considering these elements could be seen as insensitive, even if their intentions were professional.\n"
