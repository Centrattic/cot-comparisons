There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a talent competition where one of the competitors has a disability, and the author, who is a judge, gave that competitor a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was a judge in a music competition for teenagers. The three finalists included a kid with a disability (Ryan) who performed poorly but received a standing ovation from the audience. The author gave Ryan a 7/100, which the other judges found surprisingly low. The crowd boos when the actual deserving winner is announced, leading to a lot of backlash. The organizer makes the author admit a mistake, the trophy is given to Ryan, and the author faces confrontation from Ryan's mom.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on merit, but there's also the consideration of inclusivity and the purpose of the event. If the competition is purely about talent, then the author's scoring is justified. However, if the competition aims to encourage or recognize effort, perseverance, or includes categories where accessibility is a factor, the author's strict standards might be misplaced.\n\nRyan has a disability. His performance was poor, but the audience and crowd were supportive, valuing his effort and spirit over technical skill. The author's low score might be seen as harsh, but if the competition's criteria are strictly based on musical ability, then the author is following the rules. However, the situation seems to highlight a conflict between objective talent and subjective values like perseverance and inclusivity.\n\nThe author's friends say they aren't wrong but are an asshole, implying that while they did what they thought was right, their approach was insensitive. The author's refusal to adjust the score despite the backlash could be seen as rigid. On the other hand, the judges are supposed to be impartial, and the author might have done their duty by the competition's stated criteria. However, if the competition's purpose wasn't purely about technical skill (like if it's meant to inspire or support kids, including those with disabilities), then the author's judgment might be inappropriate.\n\nThe fact that Ryan's mom reacted aggressively and said racist things might influence the perception, but the author's responsibility is to the competition's criteria. However, the author might have failed to consider the broader context of the event's purpose. If the competition is meant to be a platform for all kids, including those with disabilities, the author's strict scoring could be seen as undermining that purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if the competition's criteria are strictly about talent. However, if the competition's intent is broader, the author's actions could be seen as missing the point. The answer hinges on the competition's stated goals. Since the author's justification is based on their expertise and the competition's rules, but the outcome led to a lot of negative consequences, it's a nuanced case. However, the author did follow their judgment based on the criteria, so maybe they are not in the wrong. But the harshness and the aftermath might imply that they were too rigid. I need to decide between A and B.\n"
