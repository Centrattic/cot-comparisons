There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a music competition where the author, as a judge, gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability. The key points here are the author's actions and the context.\n\nFirst, the author scored Ryan, the kid in the wheelchair, a 7/100, which they admitted was even lower than necessary. The other two judges probably gave higher scores because they were affected by the emotional situation\u2014Ryan messed up, got upset, the crowd cheered for him, and his mom was there. The author stayed firm on their assessment, which led to a backlash from the audience and Ryan's mother. The organizer forced the author to publicly retract their decision, which caused the deserving winner to lose.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. As a judge, their role is to evaluate based on skill and performance. The author claims Ryan's performance was bad, so they gave a low score. But the disability aspect complicates things. Did the author take into account the challenges Ryan might face due to his disability? Maybe Ryan's performance was affected, but the author didn't adjust for that, possibly being harsher than necessary. The other judges and the crowd didn't see it the same way, suggesting that there might be room for different interpretations of \"talent,\" especially when considering perseverance and effort.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude in the story comes across as dismissive. They called the music school \"shitty\" and seemed to downplay the crowd's reaction. The way they describe Ryan's performance as \"atrocious\" and \"cringe\" without acknowledging possible extenuating circumstances could be seen as lacking empathy. Even if the author's job is to be objective, in reality, competitions sometimes balance technical skill with the performer's ability to engage the audience, especially when there's a compelling story. The author might have failed to consider that the competition's intent wasn't just about technical skill but also about inspiring people, given Ryan's disability.\n\nMoreover, the author's friends said they weren't wrong but were just an asshole. That suggests that while the author did what they believed was right, their approach and attitude might have been unkind. The aftermath, where the organizer had to change the result and the mother reacted angrily, indicates that the author's strict adherence to their score caused unnecessary harm. Even if the author wasn't technically wrong in their assessment, their failure to consider the broader context and the emotional impact on others could make them at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their strict judgment over empathy and the spirit of the competition, leading to negative consequences.\n"
