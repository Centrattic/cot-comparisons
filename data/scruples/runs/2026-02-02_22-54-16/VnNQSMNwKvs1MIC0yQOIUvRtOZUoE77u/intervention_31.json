There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they judged a talent competition and gave a low score to a kid with a disability, which caused some backlash. The kid ended up winning because the crowd and other judges' scores pushed him over, but the organizer made the author reverse their decision.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they gave scores based on the performance. The kid with the disability (Ryan) played poorly, according to the author, and they felt he didn't deserve to win. But the crowd loved him because of his perseverance, which the author might not have factored in. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness and the role of a judge. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on skill and performance, not popularity or other factors. If the performance was objectively worse, then the author's decision to give a low score isn't necessarily wrong. However, there's a disability angle here. Did the author account for possible accommodations or challenges Ryan might have faced during the performance? The author says Ryan played worse than someone who never played, but maybe he had specific difficulties related to his disability that others didn't consider. \n\nThen there's the crowd's reaction. The crowd was cheering for Ryan, and even the other judges were shocked at the low score. The organizer and others pressured the author to retract their decision. But the author's responsibility is to their own judgment, not the crowd's opinion. However, maybe the author didn't consider the emotional and motivational aspects that the competition might have aimed to reward. If the competition's criteria included perseverance or overcoming adversity, then Ryan might have deserved points there. But the author's score was based purely on musical skill. \n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole. That's an interesting take. It suggests that while the action was harsh, it's not necessarily morally wrong. The author might have been too strict in their evaluation without considering the competition's broader goals. \n\nOn the other hand, being a judge means providing an honest assessment based on the given criteria. If the criteria were strictly about musical skill, then the author did their job. However, maybe the competition also valued effort and overcoming obstacles, which the author didn't account for. \n\nThe mother's reaction was confrontational, and the author was honest about their reasoning. But maybe the author should have considered the context of the competition and the possible intention to celebrate perseverance. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for scoring based on their professional judgment, but they might be wrong if the competition's rules didn't strictly prioritize technical skill. The author's actions caused a backlash, but if the rules were clear, then the author followed them. However, in a setting where emotional impact and inspiration are also valued, the author might have missed that aspect. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the competition was purely about technical skill, then no. But if it's supposed to celebrate overcoming adversity, then maybe they didn't account for that. The fact that Ryan's mother mentioned \"fighter\" and the crowd's reaction suggests that this was a key aspect. The author might have been too rigid in their evaluation. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the competition's possible goals beyond technical skill, leading to a harsh outcome. But if the rules were strictly about skill, then B (not in the wrong) would be correct. The problem is that the story doesn't clearly state the competition's criteria. However, given that the crowd and others reacted to Ryan's perseverance, the author might have missed that, making them at least partially responsible for not aligning with the event's intended values.\n"
