There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a contestant with a disability in a talent competition. The situation is pretty detailed. \n\nFirst, the author was a judge, and one of the contestants, Ryan, who uses a wheelchair, performed poorly. The author gave him a very low score, which led to controversy because the crowd and other judges didn't expect it. The crowd booed the actual deserving winner and cheered for Ryan. The organizer forced the author to retract their judgment, leading to the trophy going to Ryan, but he then gave the scholarship to the deserving contestant.\n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole. The user themselves think the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in judging. The author is a professional musician with experience, so they might believe in merit-based scoring. However, the contestant had a disability, which might make people think the author was harsh. But the question is whether they did something wrong by not giving a higher score just because of the disability.\n\nIn competitions, especially talent-based ones, the standard is performance quality. If Ryan's performance was objectively worse, the author's judgment could be valid. But the crowd and other judges might have been influenced by emotion, like sympathy for the disability. The author might be seen as upholding standards, but others could argue that the system failed in handling such a situation sensitively. \n\nHowever, even if the author believed in merit, the way they handled it might have been tactless. Maybe there was a way to support Ryan's effort while being honest about the score. But the author's actions led to public backlash and conflict with the organizer and the family. The main issue is whether the author's judgment was unethical or if they were just being honest.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's possible the author wasn't in the wrong because they were doing their job, but they might have been inconsiderate of the emotional and social dynamics present. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could be a legal or moral stance. Since there's no law against judging talent objectively, the author might not be wrong, but might be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nThe user's own view is that the author isn't wrong, and the friends agree, so the answer might be B (No). But I need to consider if the disability aspect affects the judgment. If the competition didn't have a specific category for disabilities, then the author's scoring based on performance is valid. If the competition was meant to support people with disabilities, then the author might be wrong. However, the description doesn't mention that. The competition is for teenage kids, not specifically for disabled individuals. So the author's action is about evaluating talent, not excluding someone based on disability. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
