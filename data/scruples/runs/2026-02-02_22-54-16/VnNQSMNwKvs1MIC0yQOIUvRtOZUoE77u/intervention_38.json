There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a music competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author, who is a judge, gives the disabled contestant a very low score, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author scored the kid with a wheelchair a 7/100, which is extremely low. The other two judges were surprised by this. The crowd and the other participants were supportive of the disabled contestant, even after his performance wasn't technically good. The author's decision led to the deserving winner being booed, and the organizer made the author retract their decision, awarding the prize to the less talented contestant. The author's friends think they're not wrong but call them an asshole for doing the right thing.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether it's wrong to judge purely based on talent, even if that means a contestant with a disability loses. There's a tension between fairness and compassion. On one hand, the competition should be based on merit. On the other hand, there's a social responsibility to support and encourage individuals with disabilities, even if their performance isn't the best.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as correct in terms of adhering to the competition's purpose, which is to reward the most talented. However, the backlash from the crowd and the organizer suggests that there's an expectation to consider the contestant's disability and the emotional impact of the situation. The author's refusal to adjust the score despite the pressure could be seen as sticking to their principles, but the resulting conflict and the contestant's mom's reaction indicate that the author's approach might have been insensitive.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the judges. If the competition is supposed to be about talent, then the author did their job. However, competitions sometimes also aim to inspire and promote inclusion, which might require a different approach. The fact that the organizer forced the author to change the decision shows that there's a societal expectation here, even if it's not strictly based on merit.\n\nThe author's friends' reaction is mixed. They acknowledge the author did what they thought was right but call them an asshole. This suggests that while the action was technically correct by the competition's rules, the social context complicates it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's position is ethically ambiguous. If the competition's primary goal is to reward the most talented, then the author is not in the wrong. However, if the competition also aims to be inclusive and supportive of participants with disabilities, then the author's strict adherence to merit might be seen as lacking empathy. The question of whether the author is in the wrong depends on the values being prioritized. Given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they followed their duty as a judge, but there's a strong case for A (wrong) due to the social and emotional impact.\n"
