There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a talent competition where the author judged and gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, which caused controversy.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they scored based on the performance. Ryan, the disabled contestant, played poorly, and the author felt he didn't deserve high marks. The author believes they were just being honest. However, the other judges and the audience didn't agree, leading to the author being pressured to retract their judgment, which they did, but then faced backlash.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on merit, but there's also the consideration of inclusivity and the intent behind such events. If the competition was meant to celebrate perseverance or include people with disabilities, then the author's strict adherence to technical skill might have overlooked the event's purpose. However, if it's purely about talent, then the author's scoring is justified.\n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole, implying their actions were correct but their manner might have been harsh. However, the author's low score led to public outrage and the eventual reversal of the decision, which suggests that the community valued the inspirational aspect over technical skill. The author's refusal to adjust their score initially caused harm to the deserving winner and created a difficult situation for the organizers.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about Ryan not deserving even 7 points could be seen as dismissive and lacking empathy. While the author has a valid point about merit, the way they handled it and the consequences might make them at fault for not considering the broader context of the competition's purpose and the emotional impact on participants.\n\nSo, balancing the principles of fairness, empathy, and the context of the event, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their strict scoring ignored the event's possible intent to celebrate effort and inclusion, leading to negative outcomes for others.\n"
