There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where one of the participants has a disability. The author, who's a judge, gave a very low score to the kid with a disability, Ryan. The other judges probably gave higher scores, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the judges are supposed to evaluate based on talent and performance, then the author's low score might be justified if Ryan's performance was objectively worse. But there's a problem here because Ryan has a disability. Maybe the competition has rules about accommodations or different criteria for people with disabilities? The author didn't mention that, so maybe not. But even so, the key issue is whether scoring based purely on performance is fair, even if the performer has a disability.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the crowd's reaction and the mother's reaction. The crowd was cheering for Ryan despite his performance, which suggests that people valued his effort and perseverance over technical skill. The author might be seen as being too harsh, not considering the spirit of the competition or the intent to inspire. Competitions sometimes have elements beyond just technical skill, like heart or overcoming obstacles. If the competition's purpose was to encourage participation and perseverance, then maybe the author's strict technical evaluation was at odds with that goal.\n\nThe author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole. That's interesting. It might mean that while the author did what they thought was right, their approach was tactless or insensitive. The author might have failed to consider the emotional impact of their decision on Ryan and his family. Even if the scoring was fair, the way it was handled caused a lot of distress, leading to a confrontation and the need to reverse the decision. \n\nAlso, the author was an undergraduate student dealing with adults, which might have added to the pressure, but that doesn't excuse being insensitive. The fact that the organizer made the author publicly admit a mistake and the trophy was given to Ryan despite the author's opinion shows that there's a social or ethical expectation to value participation and effort, especially for someone with a disability. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between being honest about one's judgment and being insensitive. The author's low score might be their honest opinion, but in a setting where the competition's values include inclusivity and encouragement, the author's strict adherence to technical merit might be seen as missing the point. Plus, the confrontation with Ryan's mother and the subsequent chaos indicate that the author's actions had negative consequences beyond just the competition result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might believe they were right to judge based on skill, the situation requires considering the broader context of the competition's purpose, the impact on participants, and societal values around disability. The author's actions led to a negative outcome for the deserving winner and caused emotional distress, which suggests that they might be in the wrong, even if their intentions were to be fair.\n"
