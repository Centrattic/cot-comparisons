There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author was a judge in a talent competition for teenagers, and one of the contestants had a disability. The author gave the disabled contestant a very low score, which they felt was deserved because the performance was bad. However, the crowd and other judges didn't react well, and the author ended up being pressured to change the results, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they judged based on talent. They mention their own experience with music, so they probably felt qualified to assess the performances. Ryan's performance was so bad that the author gave him a 7/100, which is extremely low. But the crowd and Ryan's mom were very supportive, leading to the audience's negative reaction when the original winner was announced.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Was it wrong to judge purely on talent, regardless of the contestant's disability? On one hand, competitions are supposed to be about merit. The author might believe they're upholding that standard. On the other hand, there's an argument that people with disabilities might need encouragement, and the competition might have a goal of promoting inclusion beyond just talent. The fact that the crowd and the other judges were surprised suggests that the author's approach was seen as harsh, especially in a context where emotional support for the disabled contestant was valued.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an \"asshole\" but not wrong. So there's a nuance here. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their moral judgment (they think they're right), but their approach could be seen as insensitive. The key points are: Did the author act unethically by not considering the broader context of supporting someone with a disability? Was the competition's purpose purely about talent, or did it have an inclusivity aspect?\n\nThe organizer made the author retract their judgment, which implies that the competition might have had a policy or cultural expectation to support participants with disabilities, even if their performance wasn't the best. The author's decision to stand by their assessment might conflict with that. Additionally, the author's friends acknowledged that the author was correct in their assessment but labeled them as an asshole, pointing to the difference between being right and being tactful.\n\nIn terms of legal or organizational rules, if the competition had specific guidelines about considering disability, the author might be in the wrong. But the story doesn't mention any such rules. The author acted based on their expertise, but the social backlash suggests that their approach was not aligned with the expectations of the event's attendees or organizers. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the competition is purely about talent, then the author is justified. However, if the event also aimed to promote inclusion and support for individuals with disabilities, the author's actions might be seen as undermining that goal. The fact that the other judges were taken aback and the crowd was upset indicates that the author's actions went against the intended spirit of the competition. Therefore, while the author might not be wrong in their personal assessment, they could be in the wrong in the context of the event's broader objectives and the social dynamics at play.\n"
