There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a music competition where the author judged a contestant with a disability and gave them a very low score, leading to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a judge, and there are three contestants. One of them, Ryan, uses a wheelchair. The author thinks Ryan's performance was terrible, but the crowd loves him for his effort. The author gives Ryan a 7/100, which is extremely low, while the others get higher scores. The crowd boos the actual winner, and there's a lot of pressure on the author to change their score, leading to some embarrassment for the deserving winner. The author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole for being honest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical issue here is whether it's fair to judge a person with a disability based solely on their performance, especially in a competitive setting. But there's also the aspect of the competition's purpose. If it's a talent competition, the judges are supposed to evaluate skill and performance, regardless of the contestant's circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of ableism here. The author might have felt that Ryan's disability affected their judgment, even if unintentionally. But the author explicitly states that Ryan's performance was objectively bad, not because of his disability, but because of his skill level. The crowd's reaction was about sympathy rather than talent. The author's decision to give a low score was based on the performance, which is their role as a judge. However, the aftermath caused a lot of distress, and the organizer made the author retract their decision, which is problematic because it undermines the integrity of the competition.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as upholding the standards of the competition. But the way the situation unfolded, with the crowd's reaction and the mother's behavior, suggests that there's a societal tendency to prioritize perceived effort over actual skill in cases involving disabilities. The author's honesty might have been unpopular, but was it wrong?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's judgment was based on the performance or on biased assumptions about the contestant's disability. The author claims it was the former, but the low score and the resulting controversy indicate that the disability might have played a role in how the performance was perceived. Also, the fact that the other judges didn't share the same low score could imply that the author's assessment was overly harsh.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author did their job as a judge, but the competition's environment might have been flawed. The organizer's demand for the author to recant their score suggests that the competition wasn't prepared to handle such a situation fairly. The author might not be in the wrong for their initial judgment but could be in the wrong for not anticipating the social dynamics and the pressure from the crowd and organizers. Alternatively, the problem lies with the system that forced the author to compromise their judgment under social pressure.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were based on their professional duty, but the aftermath shows that the competition's structure and societal attitudes towards disability might have been at fault. However, the author's harsh judgment and the subsequent events where they had to retract their score could imply that they were wrong to not consider the broader implications of their decision, even if their initial intent was to be fair.\n"
