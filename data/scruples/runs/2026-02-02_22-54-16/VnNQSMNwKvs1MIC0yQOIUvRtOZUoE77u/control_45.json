There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the story says that Ryan, the kid with a disability, played poorly but received a lot of audience support. The author gave him a 7/100, which led to controversy. The crowd booed the actual skilled winner and cheered for Ryan. The author was pressured to reverse the decision, which they did, but then faced backlash.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on talent and performance, right? So if the author believed Ryan's performance was subpar, they have a responsibility to score him accordingly. But there's an aspect of empathy and the spirit of the competition. The audience was moved by Ryan's effort and his mom's support. Maybe the judges didn't account for the emotional impact beyond technical skill?\n\nBut the author's role is to judge technically. They might have been strict, but they were honest. However, the situation got messy because the other judges didn't support their decision. The author was forced to reverse it, leading to the deserving winner being stripped of the title. That's a problem because the initial judgment was fair, but external pressure changed it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole. Maybe the issue is the harshness of the score and not considering the context of the performance. Ryan changed his piece mid-performance, tried to continue, and the crowd supported him. The author's score might have been too strict, not taking into account the circumstances like nerves or the disability-related challenges.\n\nAlso, the author was an undergraduate dealing with adults, which might have added stress. But the core issue is whether judging based on technical merit is the right approach here. Competitions do reward skill, but sometimes they also celebrate perseverance. However, the author's responsibility is to evaluate the performance as it was, regardless of the audience reaction.\n\nIn the end, the author did what they thought was right, but maybe didn't consider the broader context of the competition's purpose. If the competition is meant to be inclusive and uplifting, a strict technical score might not align with that. However, if it's about musical skill, then the author's judgment is valid. The problem arises when the judges' scores don't align with the competition's stated values or when there's a lack of transparency in judging criteria.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for scoring based on their expertise, but they might be in the wrong for not considering the competition's intent to encourage participants, especially those with disabilities. The situation is complex, but the primary fault might lie in the other judges and the organizers not handling the situation gracefully instead of the author's scoring.\n"
