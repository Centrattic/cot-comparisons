There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, they were a judge at a music competition where three teens performed. One of them, Ryan, has a disability and uses a wheelchair. The author gave Ryan a very low score (7/100) because they thought his performance was terrible. But the crowd and other judges reacted badly, leading to the competition being overturned in Ryan's favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the judges' scores are the official criteria for determining the winner, then the author was just doing their job by rating based on performance. But if there's an unspoken rule to prioritize inclusivity or the spirit of the event over technical skill, that might complicate things. The author's friends said they weren't wrong, but called them an asshole for being honest. \n\nRyan's situation is important. He has a disability, and his performance was clearly not up to par. However, the crowd's reaction suggests that they valued effort and perseverance over technical skill. The author's low score might be seen as harsh, but if the competition is about talent, then scoring honestly is part of the job. \n\nThe other judges and the organizer were upset because the crowd didn't like the outcome. The author was pressured to recant their judgment, which they did. This might indicate that the competition wasn't purely based on merit but also on audience reaction. However, the author's role as a judge should be to assess the technical aspects, not the crowd's opinion. \n\nRyan's mom was confrontational, which adds to the tension. The author's response was honest but perhaps tactless. However, they were following their professional judgment. Whether that's right depends on the competition's stated values. If it's a talent show, then the author isn't wrong. If it's about inspiring stories, maybe they were.\n\nI think the key point is whether the competition's rules emphasized technical skill. If so, the author did their job. But if the competition values the spirit or effort, especially for participants with disabilities, then the author might be in the wrong. However, the author's experience as a musician suggests they were qualified to judge technical skill. The problem arises when the audience's sentiment overrides the judges' scores, but the author isn't responsible for that. Their role is to judge, not to please the crowd. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their honesty was unkind. However, in a competition, honesty is necessary. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
