There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a music competition where the author, as a judge, gave a very low score to a disabled contestant, leading to a lot of controversy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author judges a talent show with two other judges. One contestant is in a wheelchair, and the author believes he played poorly, giving him a 7/100. The other two get higher scores. However, the crowd and the other judges are upset, leading to the organizer forcing the author to retract their decision. The author then gets into an argument with the contestant's mom.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to give such a low score. The author's defense is that they were being honest about the performance. But the problem is that the contestant has a disability, and the crowd and others are cheering for him regardless of the performance. The author might be accused of not considering the spirit of the event or the contestant's circumstances.\n\nBut wait, the rules of the competition probably state that judges should evaluate based on talent and skill. The author has a background in music, so their assessment might be valid. However, there's a social aspect here\u2014everyone else is applauding the disabled contestant for trying, even if the performance wasn't good. The author's strict adherence to merit might clash with the audience's emotional support for the contestant.\n\nIs it fair to judge a performance solely on technical skill, especially when the contestant might have additional challenges? The author might be seen as harsh, but if the competition's criteria don't include anything about disability, then the author isn't wrong. However, the fact that the audience and other judges were shocked by the low score suggests that there's an expectation to consider more than just technical ability.\n\nThe author also had to face backlash and the organizer made them retract their decision, which might imply that the competition had some hidden expectations or values, like encouraging participation over pure merit. The author's refusal to go along with that could be seen as not understanding the event's purpose.\n\nAnother angle: the contestant changed his piece mid-performance, maybe due to nerves. The author might not have considered that under pressure, the contestant's performance could be affected. The other judges gave higher scores, indicating they might have considered the contestant's effort or the emotional impact.\n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but call them an asshole, which is a bit conflicting. The author did what they thought was right, but their approach might have been insensitive. The key here is whether the competition is purely about skill or if there's a broader goal. If it's the latter, the author's strict scoring could be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the competition's criteria include technical skill only or if there's an element of encouragement for participants with disabilities. If the former, the author is not in the wrong. If the latter, they are. But since the story doesn't mention any such criteria, the author might be justified. However, the social context and the reaction of others suggest that the author's approach was too rigid and not considerate of the event's broader purpose, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
