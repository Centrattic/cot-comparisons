There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a contestant with a disability. The situation involves a talent competition where the author, a music professional, judged a performance by a wheelchair-bound kid, Ryan, who played poorly but received a standing ovation from the crowd and his mom. The author gave Ryan a 7 out of 100, which led to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on skill and performance. The author did that, but the issue is whether it's wrong to judge someone with a disability on the same criteria. The key point here is the author's assessment of Ryan's performance. If Ryan's playing was objectively worse, then the low score might be justified. However, there's a potential for bias or insensitivity in how the author handled the situation.\n\nBut wait, the author mentioned that Ryan's performance was so poor that even they cringed. The author's job is to judge based on musical skill. The problem arises when the crowd and other judges might have been influenced by the emotional aspect of Ryan's disability, leading to a different standard. The author sticks to their professional judgment, but this caused conflict because others prioritized the emotional response over technical skill.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The author acted according to their role as a judge, which is to assess performances objectively. However, the context of the competition might have expectations of inclusivity or encouragement. If the competition was meant to celebrate effort or perseverance over skill, then the author's approach might clash with those values. But the author's credentials suggest they're qualified to judge musical merit.\n\nThe aftermath\u2014where the organizer forced the author to retract their score, leading to a deserving winner being booed and the trophy being given to Ryan despite his poor performance\u2014highlights the conflict between objective skill and subjective emotional support. The author's stance might be seen as inflexible, but it's also their duty as a judge. However, the way the author communicated their decision might have been harsh, contributing to the confrontation with Ryan's mom.\n\nIn terms of ethics, should the author have considered the broader impact of their judgment on Ryan and his family? There's a debate between strict adherence to judging criteria and compassion. The author might be in the wrong if they failed to consider the competition's purpose beyond just technical skill. But if the competition's goal was purely to find the most skilled, then the author isn't wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends said they're not wrong but called them an asshole. This suggests that the author's actions were technically correct but socially insensitive. The key is whether the competition was about skill or about celebrating participation. The author's decision to prioritize skill could be justified, but the lack of empathy in the situation might make them at fault in terms of social responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's judgment was based on their professional assessment, but the situation's sensitivity around disability and public perception might mean they're in the wrong for not balancing skill with compassion. However, if the competition's stated goal was solely to find the most talented, then they're not in the wrong.\n"
