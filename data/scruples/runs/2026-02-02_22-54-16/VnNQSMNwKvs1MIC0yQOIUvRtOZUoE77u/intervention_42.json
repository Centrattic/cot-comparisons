There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for giving a low score to a disabled contestant in a talent competition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements. The author was a judge, gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, which led to the contestant losing. The other judges were surprised by the low score. The audience booed when the deserving winner was announced, and then the organizer made the author retract their decision. The contestant's mom was confrontational and made some racist remarks.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the contestant's performance was objectively poor, even if the crowd and others were supportive. The author scored based on talent, not considering the contestant's disability. Friends said the author did the right thing but was an \"asshole,\" but the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations here. On one hand, the author's role as a judge is to evaluate performances based on skill and quality. Giving a low score to a poor performance, regardless of the contestant's circumstances, could be seen as fair. The author's comments about the performance being \"atrocious\" and the contestant changing the piece mid-performance might justify the low score from a technical standpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of empathy and the role of a competition. Competitions can be harsh, but there's also the consideration of encouraging participants. The contestant with a disability might have had additional challenges, and the crowd's reaction suggests that some valued effort and perseverance over technical skill. The author's decision led to public backlash and personal confrontation, which might have been avoidable if they considered the broader context of the competition's purpose\u2014not just to reward talent, but to encourage and uplift participants.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for ableism. By scoring based purely on technical skill without considering the contestant's disability, there might be an implicit bias. However, the author claims they evaluated based on merit, which is part of their job. The other judges didn't have the same reaction, but the organizer pressured the author to change the decision, which might indicate that the competition had a different standard or that the author's strict criteria were out of line.\n\nThe aftermath is significant. The organizer forced the author to retract their decision, leading to the contestant receiving the prize despite the low score. The author's refusal to comply initially might have been ethically correct but caused a lot of conflict. The contestant's own admission that the prize should go to the more deserving person adds complexity. The author might have been correct in their assessment but failed to navigate the social dynamics of the situation effectively.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for doing their job, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. However, given the information, the author's actions were based on their professional judgment. The problem arises from the conflict between objective merit and the subjective values of the audience and organizers, which might not be under the author's control.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were within their role and if they overstepped by being rigid. Considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong for making a professional judgment, even if it led to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer could be B (No), but there are nuances where the handling of the situation could be criticized.\n"
