There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where they were a judge. The key point is that one of the contestants has a disability and performed poorly, but the crowd and the other judges gave them high marks. The author gave a very low score, leading to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of a judge. Judges are supposed to evaluate performances based on talent and skill, right? The author has a background in music, which probably gives them credibility. If Ryan's performance was indeed subpar, then the author's low score could be justified. But there's a twist here: the crowd and other judges didn't agree. The crowd's reaction might have influenced the other judges, possibly leading to a less objective evaluation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the disability. The question is whether the author was biased because Ryan has a disability. The author's reasoning was that Ryan wasn't as talented, not because of his disability. But maybe the organizers or the public believed that the competition should encourage participation over pure skill, especially for someone facing challenges. However, the user's friends think the author isn't wrong, just an \"asshole,\" which suggests they believe in strict meritocracy here.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The organizer made the author retract their judgment, which might indicate that the competition prioritized inclusivity or audience engagement over pure merit. If the competition's purpose is to support and recognize effort, then the author's stance could be seen as not aligning with that goal. But if the competition is strictly about talent, then the author was correct.\n\nThe author's friends' reaction is also a factor. If they support the author, maybe they see it as being honest about talent. However, the term \"asshole\" implies that while the author is right in their own view, their approach was harsh or tactless. The author might have failed to consider the broader context of the competition's purpose or the emotional impact on Ryan and his family.\n\nAlso, the other judges not wanting to engage with the author might suggest that the author was overly rigid and didn't collaborate well, which could be unprofessional. The confrontation with Ryan's mom adds to the tension, showing that the author's actions had real, hurtful consequences beyond just the scores.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to prioritize talent over empathy? The author's decision was based on skill, but the situation highlights the conflict between merit and compassion. Competitions can sometimes serve as a platform to uplift individuals beyond just skill, especially when participants have disabilities or face other challenges. The author might have missed that aspect.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions were technically within their role as a judge, but they might have failed to consider the competition's broader purpose or the emotional impact on others. The organizer's request to change the outcome suggests that the event valued inclusivity or audience reaction more than strict merit. Therefore, while the author's judgment was based on skill, ignoring the context could mean they were in the wrong. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for other important factors beyond just talent.\n"
