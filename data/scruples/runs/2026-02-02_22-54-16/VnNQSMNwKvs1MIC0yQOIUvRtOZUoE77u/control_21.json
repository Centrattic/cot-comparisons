There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition, leading to public backlash. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was a judge in a music competition. The contestant with a disability, Ryan, performed poorly, but the audience and other judges apparently gave him a lot of support. The author gave him a very low score, which caused the crowd to boo the actual deserving winner. The organizer then made the author publicly retract their judgment, which led to a controversial outcome where Ryan won despite the low score.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility as a judge. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on talent and performance, not popularity or sympathy. The author believed Ryan didn't deserve the win and scored him honestly. However, the situation is complicated by the audience reaction and the organizers' pressure to conform to public sentiment.\n\nBut wait, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the context of the competition. Talent shows sometimes prioritize heart or overcoming adversity over pure technical skill. The crowd and other judges might have valued Ryan's effort and emotional impact more than his technical proficiency. The author's strict adherence to technical merit might have disregarded the competition's intended values or the organizers' goals.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an \"asshole,\" but said they weren't wrong. The user is confused because they think they did the right thing by being honest. However, in such events, the rules might not just be about technical skill. The organizers might have wanted to highlight underdog stories, which Ryan's performance, despite being technically poor, embodied through his perseverance and audience support.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to public humiliation of the actual winner and a forced decision that didn't align with the judges' initial scores. This could be seen as undermining the competition's integrity. The author might have failed to communicate their reasoning effectively with the other judges beforehand, leading to the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did score based on their expertise. It's their right as a judge to assess the performance strictly on skill. If the competition's criteria were clear that it's solely about technical ability, then the author is in the right. But if the criteria included elements like audience engagement or overcoming challenges, they might have been wrong to ignore those factors.\n\nThe fact that Ryan's mom and the crowd reacted so strongly suggests that the community valued his story more than the technical performance. The author might have missed the broader purpose of the event. Even if the author's assessment was technically accurate, not considering the event's spirit could make them wrong. \n\nMoreover, the author's response to the confrontation was honest, which is good, but they might not have considered the social dynamics at play. In such settings, judges sometimes have to balance honesty with the event's goals. If the competition was meant to encourage participants regardless of skill, the author's strict scoring could be seen as harsh and contributing to a negative experience for Ryan.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's judgment was technically honest, they might have failed to account for the event's intended values and the participants' circumstances, leading them to be in the wrong.\n"
