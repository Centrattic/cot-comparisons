There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about judging a talent competition where a disabled contestant, Ryan, performed poorly but received a standing ovation and eventually won due to the author's low score being overruled. The author gave Ryan a very low score because they thought he wasn't talented, but the crowd and others wanted him to win.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a judge, so their role is to assess talent based on performance. They believe they gave an honest evaluation. However, the crowd and others valued participation and effort over skill. The competition's outcome was manipulated to give Ryan the prize despite his performance. The author is criticized for being harsh, but others argue they were just being honest.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about fairness and the purpose of a competition. Competitions are supposed to reward skill and merit. The author did their job by scoring based on skill. However, the problem arises when the organizer forces them to change the result, which undermines the integrity of the competition. But the author's own decision to give a low score might be seen as harsh, especially considering the contestant's disability. However, the author's judgment is based on actual performance, not the contestant's circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the crowd and other judges might have been influenced by sympathy for the disabled contestant. But the author's role is to evaluate talent, not to cater to sentimentality. The author isn't in the wrong for scoring honestly. The real issue is the pressure from the organizer to change the result, which is unethical. The author didn't purposefully sabotage; they followed their judgment. The problem might be the competition's setup, which had a flawed judging system if it allowed such a low score to be overruled.\n\nBut wait, the author's friends called them an asshole for being honest. However, the author's actions were within their role as a judge. The organizer's interference is the real issue here. The author isn't wrong for judging based on skill, even if it leads to an unpopular outcome. So the answer is B.\n"
