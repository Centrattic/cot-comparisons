There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is a talent competition where the author, an experienced musician, is a judge. One of the contestants is a kid with a disability who performed poorly, but the crowd and the other judges favored him, leading to the author's low score causing controversy.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they judged the performance based on skill and quality, giving the kid a 7/100 because the performance was terrible. However, the other judges and the audience, influenced by the emotional aspect of the contestant's disability, wanted him to win. The author ended up being pressured to reverse the decision, leading to the trophy and prize going to the kid, even though the author believed the other contestant was more deserving.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, the author's responsibility as a judge is to evaluate based on the criteria set for the competition, which is talent and performance quality. If the competition is supposed to be about skill, then the author's judgment is technically correct. However, there's a social dimension here: the contestant with a disability faced challenges, and the crowd's support was based on empathy and encouragement for perseverance. The author's harsh judgment might have been seen as insensitive in that context.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about right and wrong, not just personal opinion. The author did what they thought was right, but the outcome caused emotional distress and conflict. The problem arises when the author's strict adherence to merit overlooks the intent of the competition. If the competition is meant to be inclusive or to inspire, the criteria might not just be about technical skill. However, the author was told that the competition was a talent show, which typically is about skill. \n\nStill, the author's actions led to a situation where a deserving competitor was publicly booed and the winner was changed against their judgment. The organizer and other judges may have felt the need to prioritize social harmony over merit, but was the author wrong for sticking to their evaluation? In some contexts, especially in official competitions, judges are expected to follow the rules and criteria, even if it leads to unpopular decisions. However, in this case, the author might have failed to consider the emotional and social implications, leading to a public relations nightmare. \n\nThe author's friends say they're not wrong but are an \"asshole,\" which suggests that while their actions are ethically sound in terms of criteria, their interpersonal approach was lacking. The author didn't consider the bigger picture of the event's purpose, which might have been to encourage participants regardless of their ability. \n\nSo, the author's judgment was technically correct based on talent, but they didn't account for the event's possible underlying goals of inclusivity and encouragement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the context beyond technical skill, leading to a harsh outcome that upset many people. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
