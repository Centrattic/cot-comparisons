There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The author was a judge in a music competition. There were three contestants left: one played a classical guitar well (93 points), another was a wheelchair user named Ryan who played poorly (7 points), and the third played Tchaikovsky (85 points). The crowd and Ryan's mom rallied around Ryan, leading to the organizer making the author recant their judgment, and Ryan getting the prize. The author feels they were correct in their assessment but is now being called an asshole by friends.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for being honest about Ryan's performance, even though Ryan has a disability. The author's friends say they're not wrong but are an asshole for being honest. The question is, is being truthful about a contestant's skill level, regardless of their disability, acceptable or is it discriminatory?\n\nI need to consider a few points. First, the competition's purpose. If the competition is supposed to be based on talent, then the author did their job by scoring based on performance. However, some competitions might have different criteria, like inclusion or inspiration, especially if they consider the challenges the contestant overcame. But in this case, the user mentioned the competition is for a scholarship sponsored by a music school, which would presumably value musical skill. \n\nThen there's the aspect of disability. The author didn't give the low score because of the disability but based on the performance. The key here is whether the author's judgment was unfair. The author claims Ryan's performance was bad, not due to his disability but his skill level. So, if the competition is about talent, the author is right to judge based on skill. However, the crowd's reaction and the organizer's decision might be influenced more by sympathy and the inspirational aspect rather than the actual performance quality.\n\nBut is that the author's fault? The author followed their professional judgment. The problem arises when the organizer forces them to retract their judgment under pressure from the crowd and Ryan's mom. The author might not be at fault for their initial assessment, but the situation escalated because the organizer didn't stand by the original scores. However, the author might be seen as insensitive if they didn't consider the broader context of the competition's values. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends say they're not wrong, just an asshole for being honest. That suggests that while the author's actions were technically correct, they might have been socially insensitive. The author's strict adherence to a talent-based assessment might not have considered the heart and perseverance that the competition might also value, especially if it's aimed at teenagers. \n\nBut the competition's rules should clarify what they're judging on. If it's purely based on skill, the author is in the right. If it's supposed to consider other factors like overcoming adversity, then the author might be in the wrong. The story doesn't mention specific criteria, so it's ambiguous. However, the user's friends' reaction and the author's own feelings of being an asshole suggest that there's a social expectation to value inspiration over pure talent in such settings, even if the rules don't state that. \n\nIn summary, if the author judged based on the actual performance according to the competition's stated criteria (which seem to be about musical talent), then they're not wrong. However, if the competition was expected to prioritize inclusion or inspiration, the author might be seen as harsh but not necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether the scoring was fair and based on the correct criteria. The author's honesty, while harsh, might be justified if the competition was about talent. The problem might be the organizer's handling of the situation rather than the author's judgment. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they followed their professional judgment based on the performance, even if the outcome was unpopular.\n"
