There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the author was a judge in a talent competition. There were three contestants, one of whom uses a wheelchair. The author gave very low marks to the contestant with a disability, leading to controversy. The crowd and other judges were upset, and the organizer had to change the results. The author is now asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The competition was supposed to be judged based on talent and performance. The author scored Ryan (the student in a wheelchair) a 7 out of 100 because they thought his performance was terrible. But the crowd loved him for his effort, even though his technical skill wasn't there. The author's friends said they weren't wrong but were an asshole, implying they did the right thing but were harsh.\n\nBut wait, is there a bias here? The author is a music professional, so they might have the expertise to judge technical skill. However, the crowd's reaction was based on emotional support for someone with a disability. The author's decision might be seen as strictly adhering to technical standards, but did they fail to consider the intent of the competition? Was the competition meant to reward pure talent or to encourage participation and perseverance, especially considering one of the participants has a disability?\n\nAlso, the organizer forced the author to retract their decision, which suggests that maybe there's an issue with the process. But the author stood by their judgment, believing they were right. However, in such scenarios, competitions often have a rule to avoid bias towards participants with disabilities, perhaps to encourage participation. Even if the performance isn't technically perfect, the opportunity might be given to inspire others or recognize effort.\n\nAnother angle: the author's comment about Ryan not deserving even the 7 points indicates a harsh judgment. The other judges might have been more lenient. The author's actions caused a lot of emotional distress, not just to Ryan but to his family and the audience. Even if technically correct, causing such a reaction could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut then, the author is being accused of being in the wrong for not giving a fair chance. However, if the competition is about talent, then the author's role is to judge based on skill. The problem might be that the author's judgment clashed with the crowd's emotional support, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Was the competition purely about talent, or was there a broader purpose? 2) Did the author's judgment fail to consider the spirit of inclusion? 3) Was the author respectful in their judgment, or was there an element of condescension?\n\nGiven that the author is a professional musician, they might have a valid basis for their scoring. However, the situation seems to highlight a conflict between technical merit and the values of inclusivity and encouragement. In many such events, especially those involving young people with disabilities, the emphasis might be more on participation and effort rather than technical perfection. The author's strict application of technical standards without acknowledging the context could be seen as lacking empathy, hence being in the wrong.\n\nMoreover, the author's refusal to comply with the organizer's request to retract their decision, despite causing distress, shows a lack of consideration for the broader impact of their actions. Even if they believe in their right to judge strictly by talent, the situation's outcome suggests that their actions were harmful to others, which could make them the asshole despite their professional credentials.\n"
