There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a kid with a disability in a talent competition. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was a judge in a music contest. The key point here is that the author gave one contestant, Ryan, a very low score (7/100) because they felt his performance was terrible. However, Ryan has a disability and used a wheelchair. The audience and other judges didn't agree, leading to a backlash.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author was wrong. The main factors to consider are fairness, the purpose of the competition, and the potential impact on the participants. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on skill and talent, right? The author has a background in music, so their assessment might be valid. But there's also the aspect of the audience's reaction and the emotional support for Ryan because of his disability.\n\nWait, the author didn't give a score based on disability, but purely on the performance. Ryan's performance was objectively bad, according to the author's experience. However, the crowd and other judges might have been influenced by his disability, seeing his effort as more valuable. The author's strict adherence to technical skill could clash with the audience's emotional support for someone they perceive as overcoming adversity.\n\nBut here's the catch: is it wrong to judge purely on talent? Competitions typically are supposed to be about merit. The author isn't showing bias against the disabled, but rather rewarding skill. However, the situation might be more nuanced. The audience's reaction suggests that there's a different value being placed on perseverance and participation, especially when someone has a disability. The author's actions led to a controversial outcome where the deserving winner was overshadowed by the crowd's reaction.\n\nBut then, the author was forced to recant their decision under pressure, which complicates things. The organizer made them publicly retract their judgment, which might mean the system isn't handling such situations well. However, the author's initial judgment was based on their expertise. The problem might not be the author's scoring but the way the situation was handled afterward, perhaps with insufficient consideration for both talent and the contestant's circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: Was the author's score fair? The author states that Ryan played poorly, but the crowd and other judges didn't agree. Maybe the author is being overly strict, or maybe others aren't evaluating the performance correctly. However, the author's background in music suggests they have the expertise. Still, competitions can sometimes value showmanship or audience appeal over technical skill, which might be what happened here.\n\nThe key point is whether the author acted unfairly. If the author judged based on the performance alone, without considering disability, then they might be in the right. However, if the competition's intent was to encourage participation and perseverance, especially for individuals with disabilities, then the author's strict scoring might be seen as missing the point. The organizer's reaction suggests that the competition's values might prioritize inclusivity over pure talent, which the author didn't consider.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an \"asshole\" for doing what they believed was right, which might indicate a societal expectation to be more lenient in such cases. The author's actions led to a deserving winner being booed, which is unfortunate and might reflect poorly on the competition's handling of the situation, but the author's intention was to be fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for judging based on talent, but the situation is complex. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Given that the competition might have had an underlying purpose beyond just technical skill (like promoting inclusivity), the author's strict adherence to technical scores could have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the broader purpose and values of the event.\n"
