There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author was a judge in a music competition for teenagers. One of the contestants, Ryan, is in a wheelchair and performed poorly, but the crowd and others reacted positively to him. The author gave him a very low score, which led to controversy and the eventual decision to give the prize to Ryan despite his performance.\n\nSo, the main question is: Should the author have given a low score based on actual performance, or should they have considered other factors like the contestant's disability or the crowd's reaction?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they felt that Ryan's performance wasn't up to standard and that the other contestant who worked hard deserved to win. But the crowd and the organizers, perhaps under pressure from public reaction and Ryan's mom, reversed the decision. The author is being accused of intentionally making Ryan lose, which they deny, claiming they were just being honest.\n\nNow, the key ethical issues here are fairness in judging, the role of a judge in a competition, and the treatment of a person with a disability. Competitions are supposed to be judged based on merit and skill. The author's responsibility was to evaluate the performances objectively. However, there's a broader context of how people with disabilities are perceived and supported. Even if Ryan's performance was subpar, some might argue that the competition should have accommodations or categories that are more suitable for him, rather than judging him in the same category as others.\n\nOn the other hand, if the competition's rules state that all participants are judged equally regardless of disability, then the author's low score might be justified. But the problem arises when the crowd and the organizers decided to override the scores due to pressure, which could be seen as unfair to the deserving winner.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for giving a low score? If the author followed the competition's guidelines and judged based on skill, they might not be at fault. However, the way the situation unfolded might have been handled better. For example, perhaps the author could have discussed their concerns with the other judges beforehand or considered if there were any special criteria for participants with disabilities. \n\nThe author's friends said they're not wrong but just an asshole, implying that while their judgment was harsh, they were being honest. However, the backlash suggests that the author's actions caused harm, not just to Ryan but also to the other contestant who felt disrespected. The organizers' decision to reverse the outcome might have been to maintain goodwill or avoid controversy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong in their initial judgment.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for bias. Was the author's low score due to the performance's quality, or was there an unconscious bias against the contestant with a disability? The author claims it was about the performance, but the situation could be perceived as discriminatory if others felt Ryan was judged more harshly because of his disability rather than his performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on their professional opinion as a judge, but the outcome caused significant emotional distress and conflict. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the competition's rules prioritize pure merit over inclusivity. If the rules are clear that all participants are judged equally, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the competition's intent is also to promote inclusivity and encouragement for all participants regardless of ability, then a lower score might be seen as insensitive. The answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that the handling of the situation left much to be desired, leading to unintended consequences.\n"
