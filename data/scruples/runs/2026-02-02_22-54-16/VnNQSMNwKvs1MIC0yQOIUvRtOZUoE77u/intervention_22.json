There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a disabled contestant in a talent competition. The author scored Ryan very low (7/100) because they felt his performance was bad, but the crowd and others were supportive of Ryan, leading to confusion and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of fairness and judging criteria. Judges are supposed to evaluate based on skill and performance, regardless of the contestant's background or personal circumstances. The author's main point is that Ryan's performance was objectively worse, so they scored him low. However, others, including the crowd, were more sympathetic towards Ryan because of his disability. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their assessment. They have experience in music, so their judgment might be valid. But on the other hand, the situation might have involved sensitivity towards a contestant with a disability. The author didn't consider the emotional impact of their decision, leading to a backlash. The other judges didn't back the author up, and the organizers had to reverse the decision, which caused the author embarrassment and conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an \"asshole\" for being honest but not showing empathy. The key here is whether the author's judgment was solely based on merit, which it was, but maybe they didn't account for the contest's possible intent to encourage perseverance or inclusivity. Competitions sometimes have hidden criteria beyond technical skill, like heart or effort, which the crowd valued more. \n\nThe author might be in the right in terms of technical evaluation but in the wrong for not understanding the broader context of the competition's purpose. The organizers probably wanted to highlight Ryan's effort, and the author's strict adherence to technical scores disrupted that. However, the author isn't necessarily at fault for doing their job as a judge. It's possible that the competition's rules didn't specify considering non-technical aspects, so the author followed their guidelines.\n\nBut the aftermath shows that the author's approach hurt the contestant and caused a public relations issue. Maybe the author should have discussed their concerns with the other judges or the organizer beforehand. Since they acted independently and caused disruption, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the rules strictly require judging based on performance, then the author isn't wrong. The problem is whether the competition's purpose included honoring effort beyond skill.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's judgment was based on merit, but they might have overlooked the intended message of the competition and the emotional impact on the contestant and their family. This makes it a bit of a gray area. But since the author followed their understanding of the judging criteria, they might not be in the wrong. However, considering the outcome and the organizers' reaction, there's an argument that they should have considered the broader context. The answer might depend on whether the competition's goal was purely technical or included other values.\n"
