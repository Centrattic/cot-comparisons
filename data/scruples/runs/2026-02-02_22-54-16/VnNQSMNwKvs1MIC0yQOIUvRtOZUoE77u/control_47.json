There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by scoring a disabled contestant very low in a talent competition. The situation is complex, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the author's rationale: they believe Ryan, the wheelchair user, played poorly and didn't deserve the 7/100 they gave. They were a professional musician, so their judgment might be valid. However, the crowd and other judges didn't agree, leading to a conflict. The key points here are merit vs. sympathy, disability considerations, and the consequences of the author's actions.\n\nOn one hand, the author felt they were being truthful about the performance's quality. Competitions are supposed to be based on skill and talent. If Ryan's performance was objectively worse, the author might argue they're just being honest. But on the other hand, the competition might also value effort, overcoming challenges, or audience engagement, which the crowd clearly appreciated. The fact that Ryan changed his piece and the audience cheered might mean the organizers valued adaptability or audience response, which the author didn't account for.\n\nDisability could be a factor here. Even if the performance was technically poor, the organizers might prioritize inclusivity. By giving a very low score, the author might have undermined the purpose of having a competition that includes a child with a disability. It's possible the event aimed to provide opportunities regardless of skill level, not just a strict merit-based contest.\n\nThe aftermath shows a lot of negative reactions: the crowd booing the deserving winner, the mother's confrontation, and the organizer forcing the author to retract their decision. This indicates that the author's strict adherence to technical merit caused significant distress and conflict. The other judges didn't support the low score, suggesting that the author's assessment was an outlier.\n\nAlso, the author's own friends called them an asshole, even if they agreed with the intent. The emotional impact on Ryan and his family was significant. The author's comment about the scholarship being from a \"shitty music school\" might imply that they didn't value the prize much, but others might see it as a valuable opportunity for someone with a disability.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to prioritize technical skill over other values like inclusivity or effort? Competitions usually have clear criteria. If the judges' criteria were strictly based on musical performance, the author's scoring is justified. But if there were other factors, like audience appeal or perseverance, the author's approach could be flawed.\n\nAnother angle: the author's personal experience as a past competitor might influence their judgment. They might have felt frustrated that a less skilled contestant won last time, affecting their current decision. However, that's their own issue, not necessarily the rightness of their actions here.\n\nThe key question is whether the author acted in bad faith. The user claims they didn't purposefully try to make Ryan lose\u2014they just thought he wasn't good enough. But the other judges and the crowd disagreed, and the mother felt targeted. The author's refusal to adjust their score despite the backlash might show they disregarded the broader context of the event's purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's assessment of the performance's quality might be valid, the situation's broader implications\u2014like inclusivity, the event's goals, and the emotional impact\u2014suggest that their strict scoring led to negative consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering these factors and causing harm despite their intentions.\n"
