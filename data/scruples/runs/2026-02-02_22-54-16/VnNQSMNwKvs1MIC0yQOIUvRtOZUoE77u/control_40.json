There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author was a judge. There were three contestants: one with a disability (Ryan) who performed poorly but got a standing ovation, another who played a classical piece well, and a third who played Tchaikovsky. The author gave Ryan a very low score, which led to the crowd getting upset and the organizer making the author retract their judgment, giving the prize to Ryan instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the contest was based purely on talent and skill, then the author's low score for Ryan was technically correct since Ryan's performance wasn't good. However, there's a cultural aspect here where people often cheer for the underdog or someone with a disability, even if their performance isn't the best. The crowd's reaction influenced the outcome, and the author's strict adherence to merit might have clashed with the audience's emotional support for Ryan.\n\nNext, the author's intention. They said they gave the score based on Ryan's performance, not because of his disability. But the way they described it, like \"atrocious\" and \"did not even deserve the 7 points,\" shows they were very harsh. However, the other judges didn't seem to agree with such a low score. The organizer and the other judges might have been swayed by the crowd's reaction and the pressure from Ryan's mom, leading to a reversal of the decision.\n\nThe author might be seen as right for sticking to their principles, but also wrong for not considering the emotional and social aspects of the situation. Competitions can have elements beyond technical skill, like inspiration or perseverance. Ryan's mom's aggressive behavior and the crowd's support suggest that people valued Ryan's effort and resilience over technical ability in this case.\n\nBut the author's actions were based on their expertise. They have a background in music, so their assessment might be valid. However, the way the situation unfolded could have been handled better. The author didn't consider the context of why Ryan was celebrated\u2014perhaps the competition wasn't just about skill but also about inclusivity and encouraging participation. The author's low score might have been fair in a technical sense but not fair in the context of the event's purpose.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole for doing the right thing, which is a bit confusing. Maybe they were being honest but came off as harsh. The confrontation with Ryan's mom added to the tension, but the author's response was straightforward, which might not have been diplomatic.\n\nIn the end, the author had to publicly retract their judgment, which could be seen as a failure to stand by their principles. But maybe the competition's organizers had other criteria, like considering the contestant's background or the crowd's opinion, which the author didn't take into account. So, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to the event's intended values or for not handling the situation sensitively.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While their assessment of Ryan's performance may be technically accurate, the situation reveals a failure to consider the broader context of the competition. Competitions often serve purposes beyond pure technical merit, such as fostering inclusivity, recognizing perseverance, or celebrating underdog stories. The author\u2019s rigid adherence to their own standards, without acknowledging the event\u2019s potential emphasis on inspiration or resilience, led to a harsh judgment that disregarded the emotional and social dynamics at play. Additionally, the author\u2019s refusal to accommodate the crowd\u2019s support and the organizer\u2019s wishes, despite the resulting fallout, shows a lack of sensitivity to the event\u2019s goals and the impact of their actions on participants and their families. While the author\u2019s intent may not have been malicious, their approach lacked empathy and contextual awareness, making them partly responsible for the conflict.",
