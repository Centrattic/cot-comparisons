There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author was a judge. One of the contestants, Ryan, has a disability and uses a wheelchair. The author gave him a very low score because they thought he played poorly, but the crowd and other judges didn't. The result was that the crowd boos the actual winner, and after some pressure, the author is forced to retract their score, leading to Ryan winning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the competition. If the author was supposed to judge based purely on talent and musical skill, then their low score might be justified. The author has experience in music, so their opinion could be valid. But the problem is that the crowd and other judges didn't share that view. Maybe the other judges had different criteria, like considering effort or the emotional impact of Ryan's performance. \n\nThen there's the aspect of Ryan's disability. The author mentions that the crowd was cheering for Ryan and that his mother was very emotional. Was there an implicit expectation to accommodate Ryan's disability in some way? Even though the author's score was based on skill, the context of the competition might have had a focus on encouragement or participation, not just raw talent. \n\nThe author's score led to a situation where the actual winner (based on the author's own assessment) was booed, and the author had to publicly retract their decision. That caused a lot of embarrassment. But was it the author's fault? The author believed they were following the judging criteria correctly. However, maybe they should have considered that the competition might not be strictly merit-based, especially with a contestant who has a disability. \n\nAlso, the author's friends said they aren't wrong but are an asshole, implying that their actions were correct but their manner might have been harsh. The author didn't act with malice, just based on their opinion. However, in such events, judges might need to take into account the broader context, like the organizers' goals or the spirit of the competition. If the competition aimed to encourage people with disabilities, then a lower score might not align with that goal, even if the performance was technically poor.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of Ryan's mom and the crowd. The author's low score caused distress, which might have been avoidable. Even if the author's judgment was correct in terms of skill, it might have been insensitive. Competitions often have a role in uplifting participants, and a harsh score could be seen as cruel, especially when the contestant is already facing challenges.\n\nThe author ended up being forced to reverse their decision, which might suggest that the competition's structure or the organizers' priorities were more about inclusivity than just talent. The author's adherence to their own standards of merit may have clashed with the event's objectives. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not aligning with the competition's values, even if their assessment was technically accurate.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions led to a loss of integrity for the competition and hurt feelings. Even if the author's intentions were just to be honest, the outcome might indicate that they didn't consider the broader implications of their score. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
