There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author was a judge in a talent competition for teenagers. There were three contestants, one of whom had a disability and used a wheelchair. The author gave the disabled contestant a very low score, which led to controversy because the crowd and other judges didn't expect it. The competition's winner was initially the most deserving contestant, but due to the crowd's reaction and pressure from the organizers, the decision was reversed, and the disabled contestant was declared the winner instead. The author was pressured to publicly admit their score was a mistake, leading to the trophy and prize being given to the disabled contestant, though he declined the scholarship. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's justification for scoring low was based on the contestant's performance, which they felt was subpar. However, the contestant's disability might have impacted their performance. The crowd's reaction and the organizers' pressure to change the decision suggest that there was a different expectation\u2014perhaps valuing participation or the emotional aspect over technical skill.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects here. Competitions are typically judged based on the participants' skills and performances, not on external factors like disabilities. However, there might be an expectation in some contexts to encourage or support participants with disabilities, especially in youth competitions. The author adhered strictly to performance criteria, but this might have clashed with the organizers' or audience's values.\n\nThe author's friends said they weren't wrong but called them an asshole for not considering the situation's broader implications. The author's actions led to a backlash, including a confrontational encounter with the contestant's mother. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite their belief in the fairness of their judgment.\n\nLegally and ethically, judging based on performance should be acceptable. However, in this case, there might be an implicit bias or lack of awareness about the challenges faced by a contestant with a disability. For example, the author mentions that Ryan changed his piece mid-performance and struggled. It's possible that the disability affected his ability to perform the original piece, and the judge didn't account for that. If the competition rules didn't specify that disabilities should be considered in scoring, the author might have been within their rights. But if the competition aimed to be inclusive or had a different policy, the author might have missed the point.\n\nAnother angle is the public reaction. Competitions often consider audience engagement, but the author was supposed to judge based on technical merit. The crowd's boos and cheers might not be the judges' concern. However, the author's decision caused conflict and emotional distress, which is a significant consequence. The question is whether the author should have considered the broader social context and the potential impact on the contestant's emotional well-being, even if the performance wasn't technically good.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's low score might be justified, but the way the situation unfolded\u2014especially the pressure to reverse the decision\u2014suggests that the author's strict adherence to technical merit wasn't the only factor the organizers valued. The fact that Ryan's mother felt the need to confront the author and made racist comments adds another layer, indicating that the situation was mishandled by multiple parties.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's judgment based on performance might be technically correct, their failure to consider the context of the contestant's disability and the competition's possible intent to promote inclusivity could make them at least partially at fault. The aftermath, including the pressure to reverse the decision and the resulting conflict, suggests that the author's approach lacked empathy and awareness of the broader implications, even if their initial scoring was based on merit.\n"

  "answer": "B",
  "full_response": "B  \nThe author is not in the wrong for scoring based on the performance's technical merits. Competitions are typically judged by skill and quality, and the author's assessment that Ryan's performance was subpar is a legitimate opinion. However, the controversy arises from the intersection of disability, audience sentiment, and organizational priorities. The author's decision, while technically valid, may have overlooked the broader context of inclusivity and the emotional impact on participants. The backlash and subsequent pressure to reverse the decision suggest a misalignment between the author's merit-based judgment and the event's social expectations. While the author is not \"in the wrong\" for adhering to their professional standards, the situation highlights the complexity of balancing fairness, empathy, and institutional goals.",
