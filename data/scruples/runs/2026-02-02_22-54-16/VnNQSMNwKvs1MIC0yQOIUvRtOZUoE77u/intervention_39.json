There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a talent competition where the author, as a judge, gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability, leading to controversy. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author scored Ryan, the kid in a wheelchair, a 7/100 because he played poorly. The crowd and other judges didn't agree, leading to Ryan winning after the author was pressured to change the result. The author felt they were right to judge based on performance, but others thought they were being harsh.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author acted wrongly by giving such a low score. The author's defense is that they judged solely on talent and that Ryan's performance was objectively bad. On the other hand, some might argue that the author didn't consider the context\u2014Ryan's disability, the emotional impact, or the crowd's reaction. But the competition is supposed to be about talent, right? If the rules are clear that it's based on skill, then the author's judgment might be justified. \n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't account for the fact that competitions sometimes value effort or inspiration, especially when there's a crowd reaction. But the author's role as a judge is to assess talent, not popularity. The other judges and the crowd wanted Ryan to win because of the emotional appeal, but the author stuck to their professional assessment. \n\nBut wait, the author was pressured to change the result, which makes this more complicated. The organizer made them retract their decision, which could be seen as unfair. However, the author's initial judgment might have been correct in terms of the competition's stated criteria. \n\nThe problem is that the author's actions led to public backlash and conflict. Even if they were right in their assessment, the situation escalated because of how it was handled. Maybe the author should have considered the broader impact or communicated their reasons better. But the core issue is whether it's wrong to judge purely on talent without considering other factors. \n\nIn many competitions, especially talent-based ones, the primary criteria are skill and performance. If that's the case, the author isn't wrong for following the rules. However, there's also an argument about inclusivity and not discouraging participants with disabilities. But the author didn't know Ryan had a disability beforehand, and the competition didn't mention any accommodations. \n\nSo, weighing all that, the author's actions might not be wrong in terms of judging talent, but the way the situation unfolded and the pressure to change the decision could have been mishandled. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the competition's primary purpose is to reward talent regardless of outcome, which it seems to be. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for scoring based on their assessment of skill.\n"
