There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is a talent competition where the author, as a judge, gave a very low score to a contestant with a disability. The other judges didn't agree, and the crowd was upset, leading to the author being pressured to change their decision. The author's friends say they're not wrong but call them an asshole for being honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved. Fairness and merit in competitions are usually key. If the competition's goal is to reward talent, then giving low marks based on actual performance might be justified. However, there's a social aspect here where the crowd and others might value perseverance and overcoming adversity more than technical skill. The disabled contestant, Ryan, made a significant effort, and the crowd's reaction suggests they valued that. But the author's role is to judge based on talent, not crowd sentiment.\n\nThen there's the issue of disability. The author is accused of \"making\" Ryan lose, which could imply bias. But the author states they judged based on performance, noting that Ryan's playing was poor. The author didn't give him a high score, but maybe the question is whether they should have considered other factors, like the effort or the context of his disability. However, competitions are typically supposed to be merit-based. If the criteria are clear and the author followed them, then maybe it's not wrong.\n\nBut there's also the social impact. The crowd's reaction and the mother's confrontation suggest that the author's decision caused emotional distress. The organizer forced the author to retract their decision, which complicates things. The author felt pressured to comply, leading to a deserving winner being denied. This raises questions about whether the author should have stood their ground or if they should have considered the broader implications of their judgment in a sensitive situation.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own justification. They mention they have a background in music, so their assessment might be valid. However, the other judges disagreed, which could mean there's subjectivity in judging. But if the author's assessment was correct in terms of technical skill, then it's a valid critique. However, the crowd's reaction and the mother's actions indicate that the community valued different aspects.\n\nIs it wrong to be honest in a competition? Competitions rely on honest judging. If the author's scores were based on actual performance, then it's their duty to be honest. But the situation also involved vulnerable participants, so maybe there's an expectation of leniency or consideration for their circumstances. However, competitions are supposed to be about merit, not about how people feel about the participants' challenges.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's friends calling them an asshole. Maybe because their honesty came across as harsh, even if correct. The author might not be in the wrong factually, but they could be seen as insensitive in their approach. However, the story says the author didn't mean to be cruel, just to judge based on talent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author followed their duty as a judge by scoring based on performance, even if it was unpopular. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. But there's a conflict between merit and empathy here. The answer might depend on whether the competition's goal is strictly merit-based or if it should accommodate for participants' circumstances. Since the author's reasoning seems to align with the competition's stated purpose (talent), they might be in the right. However, the way they handled it could have been more empathetic, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just being insensitive.\n"
