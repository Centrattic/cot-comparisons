There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a talent competition where the author was a judge. The key points are that one of the contestants, Ryan, has a disability and was in a wheelchair. The author gave him a very low score (7/100) because they felt his performance was terrible. However, the other judges probably gave higher scores, and the crowd was cheering for Ryan, leading to the author's low score causing Ryan to lose. The organizer made the author admit a mistake, and the trophy was given to Ryan despite the author's belief that another contestant was more deserving.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author was wrong to give Ryan such a low score. The author argues that they judged based on talent and that Ryan's performance was poor. On the other hand, there might be considerations about the role of a competition, the intent behind it, and whether it's supposed to be purely about skill or if it's also about inspiring others or recognizing effort, especially given Ryan's disability.\n\nCompetitions are typically supposed to be about merit, so if the rules state that it's based on talent, then the author's judgment might be justified. However, sometimes competitions have an element of showmanship or audience appeal. In this case, the crowd was clearly more emotionally invested in Ryan's performance, which might have influenced the other judges and the outcome. But the author, as a professional judge with experience, might feel that their role is to assess the technical skill, not the crowd's reaction.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of disability. Even though the competition is about talent, if Ryan's disability affected his performance, maybe the judges should consider that. But the author's point is that Ryan's playing was objectively worse than others. The question is whether the disability should factor into the scoring. If the competition is about musical ability, then it shouldn't matter, but if it's about overcoming challenges, then maybe it does. The user here is in a tricky spot because the competition's sponsors might have different goals, like promoting inspiration rather than just skill.\n\nThe other issue is the reaction of the crowd and the organizer. The crowd's support might indicate that the competition wasn't just about skill but also about audience engagement. The organizer forced the author to retract their score, which suggests that the event's organizers valued the crowd's reaction and perhaps the inspirational angle more than strict technical merit. This might have been a business decision to maintain the event's image or to support a contestant with a disability for good PR.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were in line with their professional judgment. They had the expertise and felt that the scores should reflect the actual performances. The problem here is that the author was in a position where their personal belief in merit clashed with the event's apparent values or the crowd's preferences. The author isn't wrong in their assessment, but they might be wrong in how the situation was handled, especially if the competition's rules or the sponsor's intentions were to recognize perseverance over technical skill.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an asshole for standing by their judgment, which is interesting. That might reflect societal expectations that people with disabilities should be given more recognition, even if their performance isn't the best. But ethically, if the competition is about talent, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the competition is meant to be inclusive and uplifting, then the author's strict scoring might be seen as insensitive, even if it's technically correct.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the competition's primary goal was to assess talent purely or to celebrate perseverance. If the former, the author isn't wrong. If the latter, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering the broader purpose. The author's low score was based on their expertise, but the organizers and crowd valued the inspirational aspect more. The author's decision might be ethically correct in terms of merit, but in the context of the event's possible intentions, it might be seen as wrong.\n"
