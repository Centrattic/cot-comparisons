There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving a low score to a contestant with a disability in a talent competition. \n\nFirst, the facts: The author was a judge in a competition where one participant, Ryan, uses a wheelchair. Ryan played poorly, got a low score from the author, but the audience and other judges didn't back him. The author gave Ryan a 7/100, which led to controversy. The crowd booed the deserving winner, and the organizers had to change the result under pressure. The author was criticized for being an \"asshole\" but defended their judgment as being right.\n\nSo, the main ethical points here. The author's argument is that they judged based on talent and performance. But the situation involves a participant with a disability, which could be a factor. However, the competition's purpose is to evaluate talent, not to consider disabilities. The author didn't intentionally target Ryan's disability; they judged his performance as subpar. \n\nBut then, there's the audience reaction and the pressure from the organizers. The crowd was cheering for Ryan despite his poor performance, possibly due to sympathy for his disability. The author's low score might have been the only honest assessment, but their refusal to conform led to a backlash. \n\nHowever, even if the author was correct in their evaluation, the way the situation unfolded might have been handled differently. For example, maybe they should have discussed their concerns with the other judges first before scoring, to avoid public conflict. Also, the organizers wanted the author to announce a mistake, which was uncomfortable, but the author's stance was that they did nothing wrong. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to judge based on actual performance, regardless of disability. The competition's rules likely require judging based on skill, not on other factors. So the author's action was technically correct. However, the social aspect is tricky. The audience and Ryan's mom may have felt that the competition should value effort or perseverance over raw talent, especially considering the disability. \n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, if the competition's criteria are based on musical skill, then the author isn't wrong. However, maybe the author didn't consider the intent of the competition. Was it meant to encourage participation and inclusion, not just to find the most talented? If so, the author's strict adherence to talent might conflict with that goal. \n\nAlso, the author's friends said they are not wrong but called them an asshole for being honest. That's a social judgment, not a legal or ethical one. The question is about being in the wrong, which is more about ethics. \n\nSo, in terms of ethical wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for judging based on the criteria set. However, if the competition's purpose was to celebrate perseverance and participation, then the author might not align with that. But without explicit criteria that include such factors, the author's judgment was based on the given standards. \n\nThe other judges didn't support the author, which might indicate that the other judges had different criteria, possibly influenced by the audience or the contestant's circumstances. But the author's responsibility is to judge based on their professional assessment. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's judgment was unfair. Since Ryan's performance was objectively worse, as per the author's experience, the low score isn't arbitrary. However, the emotional and social fallout is significant. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't ethically wrong for scoring based on their assessment of talent. The controversy stems from differing values between merit-based judging and valuing effort or inclusion. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuanced argument here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and if the competition's criteria are clear on judging talent, then the answer is B.\n"
