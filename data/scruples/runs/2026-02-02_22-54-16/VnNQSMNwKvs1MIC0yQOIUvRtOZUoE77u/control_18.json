There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about judging a talent competition where one participant has a disability. The author gave a very low score to the disabled kid, Ryan, because they felt he didn't deserve to win. The other judges and the audience were more lenient, leading to a backlash against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The competition is supposed to be judged based on talent and skill, right? The author claims that Ryan's performance was really bad, so they scored him accordingly. But the problem arises when others don't agree and the author is pressured to change their score. \n\nNow, the author's actions: they gave their honest opinion, which led to the deserving winner being booed. The organizer made them apologize, and they had to take the title away from the first place. The author's friends say they're not wrong but just an asshole. \n\nBut wait, even if the author did what they thought was right, is it fair to not give someone with a disability the chance they might need? The competition's purpose isn't just to find the most talented, but also to encourage participants. The crowd and the other judges were moved by Ryan's perseverance. The author might be accused of not considering the context of his disability, focusing solely on the technical performance. \n\nAlso, the author's comment that Ryan \"did NOT even deserve the 7 points\" suggests a harsh judgment. Maybe the author should have given a more respectful score, even if they thought he wasn't good, without being overly punitive. The way the author is described as an asshole by friends might be because they were too rigid in their scoring, not accounting for the emotional aspect or the spirit of the competition. \n\nHowever, the author's background in music theory and performance could make their assessment valid. But the conflict is between strict merit and compassion. The organizer's job is to maintain the event's integrity and the crowd's positive reception, so they might have felt forced to adjust the results to prevent disruption. \n\nThe author's response to Ryan's mom is direct and maybe lacking in empathy. Even if they believe in merit, the way they communicated their decision could have been more tactful. The fact that they called the other judges \"assholes\" might not help their case, but the main issue is whether it was wrong to prioritize technical skill over the participant's circumstances. \n\nIn the end, the organizer had to bend the rules to keep the event going, which might have been necessary. The author's stance might be seen as inflexible and not understanding the broader purpose of such events, which often aim to encourage all participants, especially those with challenges. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong from a technical standpoint, but their approach could be seen as insensitive. The question is whether that insensitivity makes them the asshole. \n\nGiven that the competition was for teenage kids and the presence of a disability, maybe the judges were expected to consider effort and participation alongside technical skill. The author might have failed to balance these aspects, leading to their being in the wrong. So, the answer might be A, but I need to check all angles again.\n"
