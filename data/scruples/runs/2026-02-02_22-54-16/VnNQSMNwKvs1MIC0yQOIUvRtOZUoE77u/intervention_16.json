There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a music competition where one of the contestants has a disability. The author, as a judge, gave a very low score to the disabled contestant, which led to controversy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The competition's purpose is to judge based on talent and performance. The author argued that the contestant with the disability (Ryan) performed poorly and that the other contestant deserved to win. However, there's a social aspect where the crowd and judges were swayed by the emotional aspect of Ryan's situation, possibly leading to sympathy votes. \n\nThe author's defense is that they followed the competition's criteria\u2014judging purely on skill. But maybe there's an expectation in such events to consider the contestant's circumstances, especially if they have a disability. However, competitions typically have rules that state judging is based on performance, not background. \n\nOn the other hand, the crowd's reaction and the fact that the organizer made the author retract their decision suggest that there was a conflict between objective judging and public sentiment. The author might have been right in their assessment but failed to handle the situation sensitively. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author was wrong for scoring based on performance. If the rules state that scores are based solely on talent, then the author isn't wrong. However, the backlash and the subsequent pressure to change the result might indicate that the author didn't consider the broader social context, which could be seen as a misstep in handling the situation, even if their initial judgment was correct.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends called them an asshole but still said they weren't wrong. This conflict between personal belief and public perception is a common theme in such scenarios. The author might not be ethically wrong for scoring honestly, but socially, they might have mishandled the situation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the competition was purely talent-based and if the author adhered to the rules. If yes, then not wrong. If the event expected judges to consider circumstances, then maybe they were. But since the author's background in music and previous experience is mentioned, it's likely they judged correctly, making the answer B.\n"
