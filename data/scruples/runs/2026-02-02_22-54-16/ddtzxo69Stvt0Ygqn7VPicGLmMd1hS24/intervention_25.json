My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about potentially lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, legal issues from past lies, and the author is frustrated. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. On one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history. The sister's pattern of lying and changing stories might make the author skeptical. On the other hand, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing it, even with skepticism, can be harmful.\n\nThe author chose to confront the sister in front of the entire family, which might have been public and potentially shaming. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author addressed it could have been hurtful. There's a line between expressing doubt and invalidating someone's trauma. Also, the author didn't take steps to support the sister, like encouraging her to go to the police or a counselor, which they might have done if they were concerned about her well-being.\n\nBut the sister's history is significant. The author might believe that their criticism is justified given the past incidents. However, even with that history, the public confrontation and outright accusation of lying could be seen as cruel, regardless of the truth. The sister might feel further isolated or discouraged from seeking help if she was telling the truth.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's history versus the seriousness of the current accusation. The author's approach might have been more about defending their past experiences than supporting their sister. The fact that the sister is refusing to go to the police and changing her story could indicate a problem, but that doesn't mean the author is right to accuse her publicly. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to handle sensitive issues with care. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the method of confrontation could have been more private and supportive. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of potential trauma, which is a serious issue. \n\nSo, even though the author has reasons to be skeptical, the way they handled it might be wrong. The answer here is tricky because both sides have valid points, but the act of publicly accusing someone of lying about a traumatic event, regardless of their history, could be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in how they approached the situation, even if their doubts are based on prior experiences.\n"
