My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying, including legal issues and making up stories for attention. The sister now claims she was raped, but her story keeps changing. The author publicly confronts her in front of the family, accusing her of lying. The sister's family is divided, and the author is second-guessing their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister's history of lying is significant. The author has evidence of past deceptions, so their skepticism isn't baseless. However, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing it outright can be harmful. Even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean a new claim is false. The author's public confrontation could have been more sensitive. Doing it in front of the family might have been harsh, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect the family from being manipulated and rightly concerned about the sister's potential to cause real harm. The sister's refusal to report to the police and changing details do raise red flags. But the author's approach could have been more private to address the issue without public shaming, which might exacerbate the situation.\n\nThe key here is balancing the sister's history with the gravity of the rape accusation. The author might have valid reasons to be skeptical, but how they expressed it could be problematic. The answer likely hinges on the method rather than the intent. So, the author isn't entirely wrong because their concerns are based on facts, but the public confrontation might have been unwise. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they acted on their beliefs based on evidence, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But publicly accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter. It's a tough call. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and the sensitivity of the issue. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they had reasons. I think the correct answer is A because even with evidence, the way they handled it was inappropriate.\n"
