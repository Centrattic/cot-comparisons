My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories, which the author mentions in detail. The sister's story about being raped keeps changing, and she's not reporting it to the police, which the author finds suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is publicly confronting their sister in front of the family, which might have caused a lot of emotional distress. Even if the sister has a history of lying, accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a heavy claim. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's account can have serious consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their sister's pattern of behavior. They\u2019ve provided examples of past lies that had real consequences, like being sued or getting kicked out of college. The sister's story inconsistencies might be a red flag, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying this time. People can have genuine trauma and still struggle to remember or recount events accurately. \n\nThe author's approach was to confront the sister in front of the family, which might have invalidated her feelings and caused further harm. Even if the author's intentions were to prevent the sister from lying again, the method used could be seen as cruel or dismissive. It's possible that the sister is genuinely a victim, and the author's public accusation could discourage her from seeking help in the future.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. Once you accuse someone of lying about such a serious issue, it's hard to rebuild trust. The author's sister might feel betrayed, especially if she was trying to seek support from her family. The family's mixed reaction suggests that the author's approach was divisive and possibly hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author might be in a difficult position, having dealt with years of lies. They might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated again. Still, the way they handled it\u2014public confrontation and a direct accusation without private discussion first\u2014might be the wrong approach. It's possible that the author should have talked to the sister privately first or advised her to report the incident rather than publicly accusing her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the sister is lying, the manner in which the author confronted her could be problematic. The author's statement about fearing jail time if the sister isn't careful might add pressure, which could be seen as coercive. Also, the author might be projecting past experiences onto this situation, which could cloud their judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's history of lying is a significant factor, the author's public accusation without considering the sensitivity of the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The right approach might have been to express concerns privately and encourage professional help or reporting, rather than making a public accusation that could harm the sister's mental health and family relationships. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their intentions were to prevent the sister from lying again.\n"
