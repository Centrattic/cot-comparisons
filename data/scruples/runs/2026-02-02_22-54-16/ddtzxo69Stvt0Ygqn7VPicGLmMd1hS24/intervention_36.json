My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her alleged rape. Let me start by breaking down the details given.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of making up stories for attention. She's been in legal trouble for lying, including suing others and filing false reports. The user is questioning her latest claim of being raped, pointing out inconsistencies in her story over time. The sister's story changed from one man in a park to two men kidnapping her, and the timeline shifted from \"spring last year\" to two years ago in December. Also, she's not going to the police, which adds to the user's suspicion.\n\nThe user confronted the sister in front of the entire family, which upset others and caused a rift. The user's reasoning is that the sister's history makes it likely she's lying again, and they wanted to prevent her from getting into legal trouble this time. But the user is now doubting if they handled it correctly, especially since the sister is avoiding them.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, the sister has a history of lying, which might justify the user's skepticism. On the other hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it without evidence can be harmful. The user didn't approach it privately first, which could have been a better step to verify the claims or support the sister if it's true. Publicly accusing her in front of family might have invalidated her feelings and made her less likely to seek help if it's true. Also, even if the sister has lied before, each situation is different, and assuming she's lying could prevent her from getting the support she needs.\n\nHowever, the user's concern about the sister's history is valid. If the sister is lying again, the user is trying to protect the family from being manipulated and prevent legal issues. But the method of confronting her publicly might be inconsiderate and harmful regardless of the truth. There's a balance between protecting against potential lies and not dismissing a real trauma.\n\nI think the key here is that the user didn't have concrete evidence to support their accusation of the sister lying. While the sister's past behavior is questionable, making a public accusation without proof could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if the user is right, the approach might have been wrong. The right course of action might have been to express concerns privately and suggest seeking help from authorities or a counselor to address the inconsistencies without public confrontation.\n\nSo, the user's intention was to prevent further harm from the sister's lies, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their skepticism is somewhat justified.\n"
