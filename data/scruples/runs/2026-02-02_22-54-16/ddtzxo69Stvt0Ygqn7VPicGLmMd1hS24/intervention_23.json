My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about lying about being raped. The sister in question has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from past lies. The author is questioning if they did the right thing by calling out their sister in front of the whole family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of lying, even leading to lawsuits and a false police report. The author has known this for years and is now confronting her about a new allegation of rape. The sister changes her story and avoids reporting it to the police. The author's main argument is that the sister's pattern of behavior makes her current claim suspect. However, the author is now facing backlash from family and feeling unsure if they were right.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is balancing the sister's potential trauma against the family's need to address her past dishonesty. On one hand, the author is trying to prevent their sister from causing more harm by lying again, especially since previous lies had serious consequences. On the other hand, publicly accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is extremely sensitive and could invalidate the survivor if they were telling the truth. Even if the sister has lied before, each case is unique, and the author's public accusation could be seen as dismissive of a genuine trauma.\n\nThe author's approach might be wrong because they didn't seek evidence or involve authorities before making a public accusation. They also didn't handle it privately first, which might have been a more supportive way to address concerns without shaming in front of others. Additionally, even with a history of lies, the current situation could still be a real incident. The author's public confrontation might have caused harm regardless of the truth, potentially alienating the sister further or discouraging her from seeking help if it were legitimate.\n\nHowever, the sister's repeated lies are troubling, and the author's concern is valid. The line between protecting the family from being deceived and supporting a potential survivor is thin. The author's actions might be seen as necessary in their eyes, but the method of confrontation was likely inappropriate. They should have perhaps documented inconsistencies, spoken privately first, or encouraged professional help rather than making a public accusation. The key issue is how the accusation was delivered and the lack of due process in their judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history, the way they addressed it publicly without evidence or a more private approach might make them wrong. The wrongness isn't in doubting the sister's claim necessarily, but in the manner and context of how they expressed their doubts.\n"
