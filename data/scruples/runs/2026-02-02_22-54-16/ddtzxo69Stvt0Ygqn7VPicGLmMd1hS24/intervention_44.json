My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The author's sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including multiple instances where she lied and ended up in legal trouble. Now, the sister is claiming she was raped, but the story details keep changing. The author publicly confronts her in front of family, says she's lying, and points out the inconsistencies. The family is split, and the sister is upset. The author is now doubting whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's history. The author mentions she's a compulsive liar with multiple legal issues from her lies. That's a significant point. People with a pattern of lying might be more likely to fabricate stories again, especially if they seek attention. However, rape is a serious accusation, and it's important to take it seriously regardless of a person's past. Even if someone has lied before, it's possible they might be telling the truth this time. But given the history, maybe the author has a reason to be skeptical.\n\nThe key issue here is how the author handled the situation. The author publicly called out the sister during a family gathering, in front of everyone. Public confrontation can be hurtful and may invalidate the person's experience, even if they are lying. It's possible the sister genuinely believes she was assaulted, but the author's public accusation could prevent her from seeking help or speaking up again. On the other hand, the author might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated again, given the sister's track record.\n\nAnother aspect is that the sister refuses to report to the police. If the author is right and the sister is lying, then the sister might end up in legal trouble. But if the sister is telling the truth, not reporting it could be because of fear, shame, or other barriers. The author's approach might have dismissed her potential trauma and pushed her further away from seeking help.\n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to publicly accuse someone of lying, even with their history of deception. Ethically, it's important to believe victims, especially in cases of sexual assault. But there's also the risk of being complicit in false accusations if someone has a history of lying. However, the method of confrontation matters. Publicly shaming someone can be counterproductive. The author could have chosen to talk to the sister in private first or approach the family more discreetly, rather than making a public accusation.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that despite the sister's history, rape could still have happened. But the author's public accusation might make it harder for the sister, regardless of the truth. Even if the author is right, the way it's handled can damage relationships and trust. The author might have been justified in their skepticism but not in the manner they expressed it.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the sister's history is a valid reason to be cautious, but the public confrontation and public shaming could be the wrong approach. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their belief, but the method of confronting the situation might be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled it, even if their doubts are based on facts.\n"
