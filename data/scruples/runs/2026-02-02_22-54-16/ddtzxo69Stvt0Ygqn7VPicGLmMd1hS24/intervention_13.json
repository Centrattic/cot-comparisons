My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author publicly confronting their sister about a potential rape accusation, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The sister has a documented history of compulsive lying, including legal consequences. The author is pointing out inconsistencies in her story and the refusal to report to the police. The author's main concern is that this is another fabricated story, similar to past instances.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is balancing belief in victims of sexual assault with the sister's pattern of deceit. On one hand, rape accusations are serious and should be taken seriously. On the other hand, the sister's history raises red flags. The author's approach, however, was to publicly call her out in front of family, which might have been harsh and could have caused harm if the sister was telling the truth.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted based on a history of deceit and tried to protect the family from being misled, maybe they're justified. But publicly accusing someone of lying in such a sensitive context could be seen as insensitive, especially if the sister is a victim. The author should have perhaps addressed it privately first or supported the sister in reporting it, rather than dismissing the claim outright in front of others.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that the sister could be telling the truth but is choosing not to believe her due to past patterns. This is a tough spot. However, the method of confronting the sister publicly and dismissing the claim without giving her space to share or seek help might have been wrong. The family's reaction shows division, which the author might have caused by not handling it more carefully.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intent might be to prevent being taken in by lies, but the execution could be seen as harmful, especially if the sister is genuinely a victim. The public confrontation and dismissal could invalidate her experience if she was truthful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, despite their reasoning.\n"
