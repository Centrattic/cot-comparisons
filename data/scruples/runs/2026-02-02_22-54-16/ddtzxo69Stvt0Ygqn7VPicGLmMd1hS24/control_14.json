My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for confronting his sister about her alleged rape claim, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author has a sister with a documented history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. He's concerned that this latest claim about being raped might be another lie, especially since the details keep changing and she's not reporting it to the police. He stood up to her in front of the family, which caused a rift.\n\nOn the other hand, rape is a serious allegation, and even if the sister has a history of lying, accusing someone of lying in such a context can be extremely hurtful and dismissive. The sister might genuinely be traumatized, and the author's public confrontation could have worsened her emotional state. There's also the risk of invalidating a real victim if she is telling the truth, though the author has his doubts based on her past behavior.\n\nI should consider the potential consequences of his actions. By calling her out publicly, he might have shamed her further, making her less likely to seek help or report if it's true. If she is lying, he might be protecting others from her false claims, but if she's telling the truth, he's adding to her trauma.\n\nThe key here is balancing the sister's history with the gravity of the current accusation. While the author's concerns are valid given her past, the way he addressed it\u2014publicly and confrontationally\u2014might be problematic. It's possible he should have approached it more privately, suggested seeking help, or encouraged her to report it to authorities, rather than publicly accusing her of lying.\n\nAlso, the fact that she hasn't reported it to the police could be due to fear, stigma, or other reasons, not just that it's a lie. The author's assumption that her not reporting it means she's lying is a leap. It's important not to dismiss someone's trauma based on their actions post-incident.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if someone has a history of lying, a serious allegation like rape should be treated with sensitivity. The author might not be in the wrong for having doubts, but publicly accusing her without evidence could be wrong. The method of confrontation might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions might be to prevent further lies, but the approach could be harmful regardless of the truth. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the public accusation and the potential harm caused, even if his skepticism is based on her history.\n"
