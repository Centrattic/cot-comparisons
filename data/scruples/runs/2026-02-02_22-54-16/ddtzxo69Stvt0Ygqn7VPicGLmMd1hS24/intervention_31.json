My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister for allegedly lying about being raped, given her history of compulsive lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of making up stories, including legal issues and past instances where her lies were proven false. The author is concerned because her story keeps changing and she's not reporting it to the police. The author publicly confronted her in front of the family, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The sister's history of lying, 2) The author's public confrontation, and 3) The sensitivity of the topic (rape). On one hand, the author is justified in being skeptical due to the sister's past behavior. On the other hand, accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a heavy accusation and can be extremely sensitive and hurtful, regardless of the person's history. \n\nThe author's approach\u2014publicly calling out the sister in front of family\u2014might have been harsh and could have caused additional trauma, even if the sister might be lying. The right approach might have been to address it privately, perhaps with support from other family members or professionals, rather than making a public accusation. Also, the author's tone suggests they're more focused on the sister's past lies than considering the possibility she might be telling the truth this time, which could be seen as dismissive of her actual trauma.\n\nHowever, the sister's pattern of behavior is significant. The author has a valid reason to be skeptical, especially when the story keeps changing. But the method of confronting her was confrontational and public, which might have been unhelpful. The line between being a concerned sibling and being dismissive of potential trauma is thin here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the sister is lying, publicly accusing her of lying in such a serious matter could be seen as wrong. It's important to handle sensitive issues with care, even if the person has a history of dishonesty. The author's intent might have been to protect the family from being misled, but the approach might have caused more harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and the handling of a sensitive issue, despite their concerns about the sister's history. But some might argue B (No), because the author is acting on a legitimate concern given the sister's past. It's a tough call, but the public accusation and the way it's handled could be seen as the mistake.\n"
