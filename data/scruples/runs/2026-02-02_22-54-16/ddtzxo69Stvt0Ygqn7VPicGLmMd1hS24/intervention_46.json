My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call them Person A, is talking about their sister who has a history of lying. The sister has been making up stories for attention, even to the point of being sued for slander and libel. She's also had legal issues for filing false police reports, like the time she claimed her roommate attacked her with a knife when she actually stabbed herself. The sister was kicked out of college for lying about a teacher, when she was actually plagiarizing. So, there's a clear pattern here of fabricating stories, especially in a way that could get others in trouble or gain sympathy.\n\nNow, the sister recently came forward saying she was raped. The story changes each time\u2014first one man in a park, then two men who kidnapped her. The timeline shifts from spring last year to two years ago. She's also refusing to go to the police. Person A, who's been through all these lies before, called out the sister in front of the family, saying they think she's lying again. The family is split, and the sister is upset.\n\nThe question is whether Person A is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the implications of calling someone a liar when they make a serious allegation like rape. Rape is a grave accusation, and even if there's a history of lying, it's possible the sister is telling the truth. However, the sister's pattern of behavior suggests that her past lies have been significant and harmful. \n\nOn one hand, Person A is in a tough spot. They have seen the sister lie multiple times before, each time with serious consequences. They might feel justified in expressing their skepticism, especially since the story is inconsistent and the sister is avoiding police involvement. They might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated or to prevent the sister from getting into legal trouble again.\n\nOn the other hand, making such an accusation in front of the entire family could be very hurtful. Even if there's a history of lying, it's a sensitive issue, and public confrontation might not be the best approach. The sister could genuinely be a victim, and Person A's public dismissal might prevent her from seeking help or being believed if she actually was assaulted. Also, the way Person A expressed their doubt in front of others could damage family relationships and might not be the most supportive approach, regardless of the sister's past behavior.\n\nBut considering the sister's history, Person A might not be wrong to have doubts. However, the method of addressing it\u2014publicly confronting her in front of the family\u2014could be inappropriate. Instead of calling her a liar openly, perhaps a private conversation or involving authorities might have been better. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The sister's pattern of lying, 2) the seriousness of the rape accusation, 3) the public nature of the confrontation. \n\nWhile the sister's history might give Person A some reason to be skeptical, the public confrontation and dismissal could be problematic. It's possible that Person A's approach is wrong, even if their doubt is based on the sister's past. The right thing to do might be to express concern privately, support the sister (if she's telling the truth) while also being cautious about the inconsistencies, but not making such a public accusation unless there's more evidence. However, if the sister's past is as clear as described, maybe Person A is justified in their skepticism. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the public confrontation was wrong. Even if the person has valid doubts, the way they expressed it caused family tension and possibly invalidated the sister's potential trauma. So maybe the answer is A\u2014Person A is in the wrong because they should have handled it more privately and with more care, regardless of their doubts.\n"
