My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author confronted their sister for allegedly lying about being raped, given her history of compulsive lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of making up stories, leading to legal issues like suing others and false police reports. The author's main argument is that the sister's story is inconsistent and she's avoiding going to the police. They confronted her publicly in front of the family.\n\nNow, the key points here. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is extremely sensitive. Even if there's a history of lying, rape is a traumatic experience and dismissing the claim can have severe consequences. The author's approach was public and confrontational, which might have invalidated the sister's feelings and shut down any possibility of her seeking help. \n\nHowever, the sister's past behavior is a factor. The author isn't just reacting without reason; they have a history to base their suspicion on. But even with that, the way they handled it could be problematic. Publicly calling someone a liar when the accusation is so serious might cause more harm. The sister might be in genuine distress, and the author's response could prevent her from getting the support she needs if it's true. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is lying again, the author might be protecting the family from further manipulation. But the line between protecting the family and invalidating a potential real trauma is thin. The author's public confrontation might have escalated the situation, leading to family conflict without resolving the issue. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to stop lies, but their method was harsh and public. Even if they believe their sister is lying, the approach could be considered wrong because it's dismissive and doesn't account for the possibility that the sister might be truthful. The right approach might have been to address it privately, express concerns, and encourage the sister to seek help, rather than publicly accuse her. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing belief in the sister's history against the seriousness of the accusation. The author might not be in the wrong if the sister is indeed lying, but the way they handled it could be seen as wrong because of the potential harm in dismissing a serious claim. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the public confrontation and dismissal of a rape accusation is harmful regardless of the sister's past behavior.\n"
