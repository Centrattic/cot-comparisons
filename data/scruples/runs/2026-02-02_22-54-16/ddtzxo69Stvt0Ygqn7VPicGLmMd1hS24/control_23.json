My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who accused their sister of lying about being raped is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe sister has a history of lying about traumatic events. The author mentions that she's been sued for slander and libel, had a false police report when she was 19, and got kicked out of college for a false accusation. The sister's story about being raped keeps changing details, and she refuses to go to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, which caused a lot of tension.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say the sister is lying. On one hand, the author has good reason to be skeptical given her history. But on the other hand, the topic is very sensitive. Accusing someone of lying about rape is serious because it's a traumatic experience. Even if the sister has lied before, it's possible she's telling the truth this time. The author's approach was public and confrontational, which might have been hurtful and unproductive. It's important to validate someone's feelings, even if there's doubt. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing privately with the sister and family, or encouraging her to seek support or report it properly. But the sister isn't cooperating with the police, which complicates things. So, the author's intent was to prevent her sister from getting into trouble again, but the method was harsh and public. The answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong because they publicly accused her without a more private approach, but the sister's history complicates it. However, the author's concern is valid. Hmm. I need to weigh the sister's history against the seriousness of the accusation. The author might not be in the wrong because they have reasons to distrust, but the way they handled it could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The sister's actions could be genuine, and the author's public confrontation might invalidate her feelings. So maybe the answer is A, the author is wrong because they should have approached it differently. Alternatively, B could be argued because the sister has a history of lying. But I think the consensus here would be that even with a history of lies, it's not appropriate to publicly accuse someone of lying about rape. So the answer is A.\n"
