My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her rape claim. The sister has a history of lying, so the author's skepticism might be understandable. But there are several factors to consider here.\n\nFirst, the sister's history. She's a compulsive liar with legal issues. That's a big part of the story. But past behavior doesn't necessarily mean this specific claim is false. Rape is a serious and sensitive issue, and accusing someone of lying can have severe consequences, especially if the claim is true. Even if there are inconsistencies, it's important to approach the situation with care.\n\nNext, how the author handled it. They publicly called out their sister in front of the family. That's probably not the best approach. Publicly shaming someone, even if you suspect they're lying, can be harmful. It might invalidate any real trauma she's feeling, even if the claim is false. Also, the author's approach could have caused emotional distress and damaged family relationships.\n\nThe sister's refusal to report to the police and changing her story could be red flags, but these are not definitive proof of lying. People who have been through traumatic experiences might have difficulty recalling events accurately or might not report due to fear or other reasons. The author's assumption that she's lying based on past behavior might be an overreach.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop their sister from lying again, but the method was confrontational and public. It might have been better to approach the sister privately, express concerns, and maybe suggest seeking help without publicly accusing her. Public confrontation can be seen as insensitivity, regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that rape is a serious matter and that they need to be taken seriously. However, their public accusation could discourage the sister from coming forward if the claim is true in the future. Even if it's a lie, the way it's handled can have lasting negative effects on the family dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's history is a valid concern, the author's public confrontation and accusation might have been wrong. The author should have handled the situation more sensitively, perhaps by discussing it privately and seeking support from authorities or professionals rather than making a public accusation. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
