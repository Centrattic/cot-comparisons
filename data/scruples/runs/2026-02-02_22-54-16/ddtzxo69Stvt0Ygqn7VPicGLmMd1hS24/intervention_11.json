My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author confronted their sister in front of the family, accusing her of lying about being raped, and they have a history of the sister making up stories for attention. The author's reasoning is based on the sister's past behavior and inconsistencies in her current story.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. On one hand, the sister has a history of lying, which makes the author question the validity of this new claim. On the other hand, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing someone's experience can be harmful. The author's approach was public and confrontational, which might have compounded the issue.\n\nThe key points here are: the sister's history of lies, the author's public confrontation, and the sensitivity of the topic. While the sister's past behavior is a valid concern, how the author addressed it matters. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue without providing support or private discussion could be seen as harsh and potentially invalidating. Even if the author's suspicions are correct, the method of confrontation might be inappropriate.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent the sister from getting into legal trouble again, which is understandable. However, the approach in front of the family might have been counterproductive. It's important to handle sensitive topics with care, especially when dealing with potential trauma. The author might not be entirely wrong in their suspicion, but the way they handled it in front of others without ensuring it was the right approach could be where they went wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, while the author might believe their sister is lying, publicly calling her out without giving her privacy to express herself and without considering the emotional impact is problematic. Even if the sister is lying, the author's method of confrontation might have been the issue here. The right approach would have been to address her privately, seek support from other family members in a non-confrontational way, or encourage her to seek help rather than publicly accuse her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's suspicion might be valid given the sister's history, but the manner in which they expressed it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because of the public and confrontational method, even if their concerns are somewhat justified.\n"
