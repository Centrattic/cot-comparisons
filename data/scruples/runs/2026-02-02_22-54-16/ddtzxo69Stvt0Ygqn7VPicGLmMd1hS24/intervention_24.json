My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for confronting their sister about a possible rape claim, considering the sister's history of lying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author's sister has a documented pattern of making up stories for attention. She's been in legal trouble for false reports in the past\u2014like a false knife attack and a fabricated plagiarism cover-up. Now, the sister is claiming she was raped, but the details keep changing. The author publicly confronted her in front of the family, accusing her of lying again. The family is divided, and the sister is upset.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're protecting the family from being manipulated by their sister's lies. They have a history of the sister lying, and the rape claim seems inconsistent. But on the other hand, accusing someone of lying about a serious allegation like rape can be very harmful. Even if there's a history of lies, rape is a traumatic event, and dismissing it out of hand could prevent the sister from getting the help she needs, or worse, reinforce her to lie again.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications. Publicly accusing someone, especially in a sensitive matter, can damage relationships and credibility. The author did this in front of the entire family, which might be seen as shaming the sister. Even if the sister has a history of lying, the approach taken here was confrontational and public. \n\nAlso, the author didn't go to the police or involve any authorities; they just made the accusation in front of family. That's different from reporting a possible false claim through proper channels. The sister's refusal to go to the police isn't a reason to accuse her publicly. \n\nAnother angle: the author acknowledges that even though the sister has lied before, she could still be telling the truth this time. However, the author's public confrontation might invalidate her experience, whether she's lying or not. If she's truthful, the author's actions could cause her further trauma. If she's lying, the author is protecting the family from being misled, but in a way that's not constructive.\n\nThe key points are: the sister's history, the inconsistency in her story, the author's intent to stop the lies, the public confrontation, and the potential consequences of both actions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent is to prevent being deceived again, which is understandable. However, the method of confrontation\u2014publicly accusing her in front of the family without supporting evidence\u2014might be considered wrong because it's a harsh and public shaming, which isn't the appropriate way to handle such a sensitive issue, regardless of the sister's history. \n\nAdditionally, by not giving the sister the benefit of the doubt and immediately dismissing her claim, the author might be contributing to a culture where victims feel blamed or not supported, even if the sister is lying. The author could have taken a different approach, like discussing privately, supporting the sister while verifying details, or encouraging professional help. \n\nSo, while the author's concerns might be valid, the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because publicly accusing someone of lying about a serious allegation without proper support is not the right approach.\n"
