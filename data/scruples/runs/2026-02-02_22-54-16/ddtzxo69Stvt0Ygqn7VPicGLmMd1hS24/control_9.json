My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying for attention, with legal issues from past false accusations. The author called her out in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's history of lying is significant, but rape is a serious allegation. Even with a history of lies, it's crucial to take such claims seriously because they can indicate real trauma. The author's approach was to publicly accuse the sister of lying without concrete evidence. Publicly confronting her might have caused further harm, especially if the sister is experiencing genuine distress.\n\nHowever, the sister's pattern of changing stories and not reporting to the police could be a red flag. But the author's reaction might have dismissed the sister's potential trauma and not provided support. The key issue here is validating the sister's experience versus protecting against potential lies. The author's method of confrontation might have been inappropriate regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n\nRape is a sensitive topic where the survivor's experience is paramount. Even if there are doubts, it's important to believe and support the survivor unless there's clear evidence of fabrication. The author's public accusation could be seen as invalidating the sister's feelings and potentially retraumatizing her. The correct approach might have been to express concerns privately, recommend professional help, or encourage legal steps without public accusation.\n\nSo, the author's actions were wrong because they publicly invalidated a serious allegation without proper support or evidence, which can be hurtful regardless of the truth. The answer is A.\n"
