My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues for false reports and plagiarism. The author's sister changed details about the alleged rape, refused to go to the police, and the author confronted her in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is dismissing a serious allegation based on the sister's past behavior. But rape is a severe crime, and even if the sister has lied before, it's important to take the claim seriously. The author publicly accused the sister of lying, which could have caused emotional harm. Even if the sister is lying, the author's method of confrontation might not be appropriate. It's possible that the author's public accusation could discourage the sister from seeking help if the claim is genuine, or it might escalate family tensions.\n\nHowever, the sister's pattern of lying is significant. The author has personal knowledge of her history, which might lead them to believe it's another lie. But the problem is that the author is making a judgment without evidence. Even if the sister has lied before, each situation is unique. It's possible this time is different, and the author's public accusation could have serious consequences regardless of the truth.\n\nAnother angle: the author should perhaps have discussed their concerns privately with the sister or encouraged her to report the incident without publicly accusing her. Publicly calling her a liar in front of the family might have caused additional trauma, especially if the sister was genuinely trying to seek support. The author's approach might have been confrontational rather than supportive, which is not the best way to handle sensitive issues.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between believing survivors and protecting against false claims, the method of confrontation, and the potential harm caused by public accusation. Even if the author's intentions were to prevent further lies, the approach may have been wrong. The correct course of action might have been to express concerns privately and suggest professional help or reporting, rather than publicly humiliating the sister.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's history is concerning, the author's public accusation without private discussion and support could be considered wrong. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and dismissal of a serious allegation, even if concerns are valid.\n"
