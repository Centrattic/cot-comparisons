My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, so the author is questioning her credibility. But the situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the sister has a pattern of making up stories for attention, as mentioned in the post. She's been sued for slander and libel, and even filed false police reports. The author is pointing out these past issues as a reason to doubt her current claim. However, the sister is now making a serious accusation of rape, which is a severe and sensitive matter.\n\nThe key here is balancing the sister's history with the seriousness of rape accusations. Even if someone has lied before, it's important not to dismiss their claims without evidence. Rape is a traumatic experience, and survivors often face disbelief or skepticism. The author's public confrontation in front of the family might have added to the emotional distress. The author's approach was direct but could have been more supportive. Instead of publicly calling her a liar, maybe they could have privately expressed concerns while still supporting her if the claim is true. \n\nAlso, the sister's changing story is a red flag, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. Trauma can affect memory, leading to inconsistencies. It's possible she's struggling to recount the event accurately. The author's public accusation might have invalidated her feelings and made her less likely to seek help or report the crime.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent potential legal trouble, but the method used could be seen as harmful. The right approach might be to encourage her to report the incident and offer support, while also discussing her history of lying in a private setting with the family or professionals. The author's public confrontation might have caused more harm than good, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons to be skeptical due to the sister's past, publicly accusing someone of lying about rape, regardless of their history, is generally considered wrong because it can retraumatize the person and discourage them from seeking justice. The author should have handled the situation with more care and sensitivity.\n"
