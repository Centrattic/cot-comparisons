My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for publicly confronting his sister about her alleged rape, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister has a well-documented history of making up stories for attention, including legal consequences. The brother has evidence of multiple instances where she lied, leading to lawsuits and other issues. The sister's current claim about being raped is inconsistent, with changing details and refusal to report to the police. The brother's reaction was to publicly confront her in front of the family, which caused a family rift.\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate are: 1) Did the brother have a valid reason to doubt the sister's claim? 2) Was his method of addressing it appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the brother has a history with the sister's lies, which might make him more cautious. He's not dismissing the seriousness of rape but is pointing out inconsistencies and her past behavior. On the other hand, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive topic can be harmful, even if there's a history of deceit. Rape is a severe accusation, and the brother's public confrontation might have caused emotional distress and potentially alienated the sister from support systems.\n\nThe brother's approach was confrontational in front of the family, which might have been impulsive. A more private and measured response could have been better. However, his concern stems from genuine experiences with the sister's past lies. The question is whether his actions, while perhaps poorly timed or public, were justified given the context.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often weighs intent and impact. The brother's intent was to stop what he perceives as lies, but the impact on the sister and family dynamics is significant. There's a balance between taking allegations seriously and acknowledging a history of deception. The sister's refusal to report adds another layer\u2014maybe she's scared or unsure, which could be valid reasons not to involve the police.\n\nHowever, even with this history, the brother's public accusation might be seen as invalidating her potential trauma. It's possible that despite the sister's past, this time she's telling the truth. The brother's public confrontation could prevent her from seeking help if she's actually been harmed. The key issue is that regardless of the sister's truthfulness, the brother's method of response was public and confrontational, which might be considered unkind or dismissive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the brother's skepticism is understandable given the sister's history, the way he addressed it in front of the family might be seen as unkind or dismissive of the sister's potential trauma. The answer might lean towards the brother being in the wrong (A) because of the public nature and the potential harm caused, even if his intentions were to prevent further lies.\n"
