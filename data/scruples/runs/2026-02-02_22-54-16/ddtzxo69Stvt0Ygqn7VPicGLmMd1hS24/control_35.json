My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's sister has made claims of being raped, and the author doesn't believe her, given her history of lying. The author confronts her in front of the family, accusing her of lying.\n\nFirst, the sister has a documented history of making false claims. She's been sued for slander and libel, had a false police report when she was 19, and was kicked out of college for lying. So, the author has valid reasons to be skeptical. However, the sister is making a serious allegation now\u2014rape\u2014which is a very sensitive and traumatic issue.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The sister has a history of lying for attention, 2) She's changing her story, 3) She's not reporting it to the police, and 4) The author publicly accuses her of lying in front of the family. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to do that. On one hand, the author might have a justified skepticism given the sister's history. But on the other hand, accusing someone of lying about a rape is extremely serious. Even if someone has a history of lying, making such an accusation in public could be seen as dismissive and harmful, especially when the sister might be genuinely traumatized. \n\nThe author's approach was confrontational and public. Even if their concerns are valid, the method of addressing it might not be the best. It could have been more appropriate to talk privately, perhaps involve authorities if there's a pattern of false reports, or support the sister if there's any chance she's telling the truth now. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police could be due to fear, shame, or other reasons, not just because she's lying. The author jumps to the conclusion that she's lying again without considering other possibilities.\n\nSo, while the author's skepticism might be understandable, publicly accusing the sister of lying without evidence (just the sister's history and changing stories) and in front of the family is likely damaging. The author should have handled it more sensitively. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they dismissed a serious allegation without proper evidence and in a way that could further traumatize the sister.\n"
