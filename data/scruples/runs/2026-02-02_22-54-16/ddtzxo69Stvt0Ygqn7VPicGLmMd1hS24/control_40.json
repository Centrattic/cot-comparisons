My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she's lying about being raped. Let me start by understanding the situation. The sister has a history of being a compulsive liar, with past incidents that led to legal consequences like lawsuits and a false police report. The author is concerned because the sister's current story about rape changes details over time and she hasn't gone to the police. The author publicly confronted the sister in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The sister has a documented pattern of lying, which is a significant factor. But rape is a serious accusation, and the author is dismissing it outright. Even if the sister has lied before, does that automatically mean she's lying now? The author's response was to publicly accuse her, which could be seen as dismissive and harmful. \n\nI remember that when someone shares a traumatic experience, especially something as serious as rape, it's important to believe them and offer support. This is because such accusations can be very sensitive, and people may not come forward easily. However, the sister's history complicates things. But the key point is that the author didn't support her and instead publicly doubted her, which can be retraumatizing if she's telling the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to protect the family from being misled, given the sister's past. But the way they handled it\u2014confronting her in front of the whole family and calling her a liar\u2014could be the wrong approach. Maybe the author should have encouraged the sister to seek support or talked to the family privately first, suggesting a cautious approach rather than publicly accusing her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that because the sister has lied before, this must be another lie. But that's a logical fallacy\u2014assuming past behavior dictates current truthfulness without evidence. Even with a history of lying, each situation should be considered on its own merits. The sister might have genuine reasons for not reporting the rape, such as fear, shame, or distrust in the system. The author's public confrontation could make her less likely to seek help if it's true.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could have serious consequences. If the sister is telling the truth, the author's doubt might prevent her from getting the help she needs. And even if she's lying, the way the author responded is hurtful and doesn't address the underlying issues. It's possible that the author should have discussed their concerns privately with the sister and maybe with a professional, rather than making a public accusation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. Even if the sister has lied before, the subject of rape is too serious to be dismissed so directly, especially in a public manner. The right approach would be to support the sister while also being cautious, maybe encouraging her to come forward to authorities or seek counseling, rather than publicly accusing her of lying without evidence.\n"
