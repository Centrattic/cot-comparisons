My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for confronting their sister about her alleged rape. The author claims the sister is a compulsive liar with a history of making up stories for attention. They provided examples of her past lies, including legal issues. The sister's story keeps changing, and she's not reporting it to the police. The author publicly accused her of lying in front of the family, causing tension. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of lying, which is significant. The author is concerned about her credibility, especially given the inconsistencies in her story. However, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing someone's trauma, even if they have a history of lying, can be harmful. The author's public confrontation might have caused additional harm to the sister, potentially discouraging her from seeking help if it's true. But on the other hand, the author might be trying to prevent a false accusation that could lead to real consequences.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event can be invalidating and damaging. Even if the sister has lied before, the author should approach the situation with sensitivity. The author's public condemnation could exacerbate the sister's trauma or push her further into denial. There's also the legal aspect; if the sister is lying, it's a felony, but the author isn't in a position to make that determination. The right course of action might be to advise the sister to report it through proper channels rather than publicly accusing her.\n\nHowever, the author's concerns are valid given the sister's history. The sister's refusal to provide consistent details and not involving the police raises red flags. The author's intention might be to prevent false accusations, but the method of addressing it was confrontational and public. This approach could have been more private to avoid further trauma and to allow for a more constructive conversation.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns, the way they addressed the issue in public and in front of the family might be considered wrong because it's dismissive of the sister's potential trauma and could hinder any real support she might need. It's a complex situation where both the history of lies and the seriousness of the accusation need to be balanced carefully.\n"
