My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for confronting his sister about possibly lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying for attention, legal issues from past false claims, and inconsistent stories. The author called her out in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past behavior is significant\u2014compulsive lying, multiple lawsuits, and previous false reports. The author's concern is understandable, given the potential legal consequences if the claim is false. However, the situation is sensitive because rape is a serious allegation and the sister might actually be a victim. \n\nThe author's approach was to publicly confront her, which could be unkind and damaging regardless of the truth. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author expressed his doubts in front of the family might have exacerbated the situation. It's important to validate the sister's experience if she is telling the truth, even while being cautious about her history. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent potential legal issues, but the method could be seen as dismissive. It's possible the sister is genuinely traumatized and using her past coping mechanisms. The author might have been better advised to approach this privately, perhaps contacting authorities or a professional instead of making a public accusation. \n\nThe family's mixed reactions suggest that while some agree with the author's concern, others might feel he was too harsh. The sister's refusal to engage with the police and changing stories are red flags, but without concrete evidence, the author's public confrontation could be seen as premature and hurtful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to prevent harm, the way he addressed the issue could be considered wrong due to the public nature and potential invalidation of a possible real trauma. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
