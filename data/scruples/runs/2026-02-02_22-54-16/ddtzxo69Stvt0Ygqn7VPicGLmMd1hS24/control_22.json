My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister is claiming she was raped, and the author is questioning her story because of her history of lying. The author publicly called her out in front of the family, and now they're asking if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. The author mentions that the sister is a compulsive liar, with multiple lawsuits and incidents where she lied, like the false police report and the college expulsion. These are serious points. The sister's pattern of behavior is a red flag. If someone has a history of making up stories for attention, it's reasonable to be skeptical when they make another serious claim, especially one as serious as rape.\n\nHowever, the author's approach here is problematic. Publicly confronting the sister in front of the family might not be the best way to handle it, even if there are doubts. Rape is a sensitive and traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim, even with skepticism, can be hurtful and invalidating. The author should consider that even if the sister has lied before, this could be a genuine case, and the way the author handled it could cause further harm.\n\nThe author's main concern is the sister's credibility due to her past lies. The sister has changed her story multiple times and refused to go to the police, which adds to the suspicion. But the author's public accusation could have serious consequences, like making the sister less likely to seek help if it's true. Also, by not approaching this in a private, supportive manner, the author might have made things worse.\n\nIt's a tough balance between being cautious about false claims and not dismissing someone who might genuinely need help. The author's intention might be to prevent future harm (like the sister getting in legal trouble), but the method of confrontation was harsh and public. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author handled it could be seen as wrong because it's not a constructive approach. The right thing would be to express concerns privately, perhaps encourage the sister to seek professional help, or involve a trusted authority figure without public shaming.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have valid reasons to be skeptical, the public confrontation and direct accusation, especially in a family setting, is likely the wrong approach. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their method of addressing the situation was inappropriate, even if their concerns have some basis.\n"
