My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accused their sister of lying about being raped, based on her history of making up stories. The sister has a pattern of compulsive lying, with multiple instances of legal issues due to false claims. The author is questioning if they were right to confront the family publicly about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a big deal. Even if the sister has a history of lying, rape is a traumatic and sensitive issue. The author might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated again, but their approach could be problematic. \n\nThe sister's refusal to report to the police and the changing story details might make the author's suspicion reasonable. However, publicly shaming the sister and dismissing her claims could prevent her from seeking help, especially if the abuse is real. There's a balance between protecting the family from false accusations and supporting someone if they are genuinely in need. \n\nThe author's public confrontation might have caused harm, regardless of the sister's truthfulness. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author addressed it in front of the family could have been more private or handled differently to avoid further trauma. It's important to consider the potential consequences of public shaming, especially in sensitive matters. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that rape is a serious issue and that their sister could be telling the truth. But given the sister's history, the author feels compelled to call out the lies. However, the method of confronting it publicly might not be the best approach. Maybe approaching the sister privately first or involving a professional could be more appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions might be to prevent future harm, but the action taken could be seen as dismissive and harmful. There's a risk of invalidating a real victim's experience, which is wrong. Even with the sister's history, the author should be cautious not to assume guilt but rather support a proper investigation or encourage her to seek help. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for how they publicly accused their sister without giving her a private chance to explain further or for not ensuring her well-being if the claim is true. The approach was confrontational and could have caused more harm, regardless of the sister's honesty.\n"
