My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer confronting their sister in front of the family, accusing her of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, including legal issues from false reports.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer is questioning if they were right to publicly call out their sister. The sister's credibility is in question due to past lies. The writer's main concern is that the sister's story keeps changing, and she's not cooperating with authorities. They also mention the sister's emotional display in front of family, which the writer then confronts.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethical angle. Accusing someone of a serious crime like rape is extremely sensitive. Even if the sister has a history of lying, the subject of rape is grave. Publicly confronting her in front of family could be seen as damaging her reputation, especially in a traumatic situation. The writer might have valid concerns about her history, but the method of confrontation might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is suspicious, and the writer might be trying to prevent her from causing more harm (like legal issues). But the way they handled it\u2014public confrontation without evidence\u2014could be seen as harsh. The writer should have perhaps addressed this privately first, maybe with the family, or encouraged the sister to seek help without public shaming. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police is a red flag. However, if the sister is lying, the writer's warning about legal consequences could be justified. But the public accusation in front of the family might have been too confrontational and hurtful, regardless of the sister's past.\n\nSo, the writer's intentions might be to protect the family from being manipulated, but the approach could be seen as tactless. The question is whether the writer was wrong in their actions. Considering the sensitivity of the issue and the public nature of the accusation, even with valid concerns, the method was likely inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the writer is in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and not handling it with more discretion, despite their concerns.\n"
