My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. Let me start by understanding the situation. The sister has a history of lying for attention and has been involved in legal issues because of her false claims. The author is saying that based on the sister's pattern of behavior and the inconsistencies in her story, they believe she's lying again.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The sister is a compulsive liar with a track record of making up serious allegations. The author is concerned that if they don't call her out, she might face legal consequences this time. But the issue here is that the author publicly confronted the sister in front of the family, which caused a family rift.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is it ever right to accuse someone of lying about rape, especially in public? Rape is a serious accusation and a sensitive topic. Even if someone has a history of lying, making such a public accusation could be harmful. However, the author is not making the accusation to the authorities but to their family, based on their knowledge of the sister's past behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect the family from being deceived and possibly prevent the sister from getting into more trouble. The author might feel that the sister's pattern of lying is a red flag. On the other hand, publicly accusing someone of lying about rape can be damaging, regardless of the truth. It could lead to the victim feeling blamed or not supported, which is a common issue in real-life situations. But the sister's history complicates things.\n\nThe dilemma here is between the right to question inconsistencies in a story (especially with a history of deception) and the potential harm in publicly calling out someone for lying about a traumatic event. The author's approach was confrontational in front of the family, which might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe a private conversation would have been better, as the author later considered.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The sister's past behavior is a major factor. If someone has consistently lied about serious matters, others might have valid reasons to be skeptical. However, assuming someone is lying without evidence can be problematic. The author is acting on their belief based on past experiences, but they might not have concrete proof this time. So, while the author's intent might be to prevent deception, the method of confrontation in a public setting could be seen as insensitive.\n\nIn some cases, even if someone has lied before, it's important to take their current claims seriously to avoid invalidating any real trauma. However, the sister's refusal to report to the police and the changing stories might indicate a lack of credibility. The author is in a tough spot between protecting the family from another lie and potentially missing a genuine case of assault.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong because of the sister's history, but the public confrontation and the manner in which it was done could be seen as inappropriate. The answer might depend on how one balances the sister's history with the sensitivity of the accusation.\n"
