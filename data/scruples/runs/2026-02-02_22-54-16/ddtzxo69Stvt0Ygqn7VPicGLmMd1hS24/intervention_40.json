My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, with multiple instances of filing false reports and legal issues. The author's main argument is that, given this history, they don't believe the current claim and confronted the sister in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. Accusing someone of a serious crime like rape is a huge deal, especially in front of others. Even with a history of lying, the author's public confrontation might have caused more harm. The sister is emotional and the situation is sensitive. The author might have valid concerns based on past behavior, but the method of addressing it was confrontational and in public.\n\nThen there's the legal aspect. The sister hasn't reported the rape to the police, which is a red flag. But the author isn't in a position to make that determination. They can express their skepticism, but publicly calling someone a liar, especially in such a serious context, could be seen as cruel and dismissive. It might also discourage the sister from seeking help if she was truthful.\n\nThe author mentions that they had private concerns and finally addressed it publicly. Maybe a private conversation would have been more appropriate. Public shaming, even if the intentions are to prevent future lies, can damage relationships and may not be the right approach. \n\nHowever, the sister's history is extensive, which complicates things. The author is protecting their family from lies but potentially invalidating a legitimate claim. The key question is whether the author has the right to make that judgment without evidence. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's skepticism might be understandable, the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. The public confrontation, especially in front of family, might be hurtful and inappropriate regardless of the sister's past. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation matters. The author might not be wrong in their doubt but is definitely in the wrong in how they expressed it publicly without a more private discussion first.\n\nSo the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because of the public accusation and the manner in which it was handled, despite their reasoning.\n"
