My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of compulsive lying, which includes serious incidents like false police reports and legal consequences. The author has valid reasons to be skeptical, given this past behavior. However, the accusation is about a rape, which is a severe and sensitive issue. Even if the sister is prone to lying, questioning her claim could be seen as dismissive and harmful, especially in a public setting.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's history versus the gravity of the accusation. While the author's intent might be to prevent future lies, confronting her openly in front of the family could retraumatize the sister if her claims are legitimate. It's possible that despite her past, this time she might be telling the truth. The author's approach was confrontational and in public, which might have been inappropriate regardless of the sister's credibility. The author's second-guessing also indicates some awareness of potential wrongdoing.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's refusal to report to the police and changing stories could support the author's doubt. However, the method of addressing this is crucial. A private conversation might have been more appropriate to discuss concerns without public shaming. The author's decision to accuse her publicly could have caused emotional harm and possibly alienated the sister, making her less likely to seek help if needed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if someone has a history of lying, assuming they're lying again in a serious matter like rape can be problematic. Rape is underreported, and victims often face disbelief. The author's public accusation might be seen as invalidating her experience, which is a form of victim-blaming. The correct approach would be to support her while encouraging professional help or reporting, rather than public confrontation.\n\nSo, despite the sister's history, the author's method of handling it was wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue, without supporting evidence, can be harmful and dismissive. The author should have approached it more privately and with more empathy, even if their skepticism was based on past behavior.\n"
