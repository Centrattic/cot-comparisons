My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says their sister is a compulsive liar with a history of making things up for attention. She's been sued for slander and libel, and even filed a false police report. Now, she's claiming she was raped, but her story keeps changing, and she won't go to the police.\n\nThe author's main argument is that because of the sister's past behavior, they don't believe her. They called her out in front of the family, which caused a big reaction. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Believing someone who's been accused of lying could be problematic, but accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious accusation. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim can have severe consequences. However, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history. The sister has a pattern of making up stories, so the author isn't acting without reason.\n\nBut the way the author confronted the sister in front of the family might be an issue. Publicly calling someone a liar, especially in a sensitive matter like rape, could be hurtful and potentially worsen the situation. However, the author might feel that this was necessary given the sister's past behavior and the potential legal repercussions if the false claim leads to charges.\n\nAnother angle: the sister might be in genuine distress, even if her story is inconsistent. The author's approach might have shut down any chance of her getting help. On the other hand, if the sister is lying, the author is trying to prevent further harm to others and avoid legal trouble.\n\nI need to weigh the sister's right to be believed against the author's duty to protect others from false accusations. The author isn't in a legal position to determine the truth, but their concerns are based on prior knowledge. However, the method of confrontation could have been inappropriate. Maybe a private conversation with the sister and possibly involving authorities if needed would have been better.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for their skepticism, the public confrontation and outright accusation might be wrong, especially without evidence. But given the sister's history, the author's intention might be to prevent harm. It's a tough call, but the approach taken might be problematic.\n"
