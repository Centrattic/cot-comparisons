My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister over a rape allegation, given the sister's history of lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points presented. The sister has a documented history of making up stories, including legal consequences like lawsuits and being kicked out of college. The author is concerned about her inconsistencies in the rape story\u2014changing details like the number of attackers and the timeline. The author publicly accused her of lying in front of the entire family, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether accusing someone of lying, especially in a sensitive matter like rape, is wrong. There are a few angles here. On one hand, rape is a serious issue and accusations should be taken seriously. However, the sister's history of lies is significant. The author might feel justified in their skepticism given the past behavior.\n\nBut even if the sister has lied before, making a public accusation of lying in a sensitive case like rape can be very harmful. It could discourage the sister from coming forward if it's true, or it could be seen as invalidating her experience. The approach the author took\u2014public confrontation without perhaps ensuring all the facts are in order\u2014might be seen as dismissive and hurtful. Even if the author's concerns are based on facts, the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister is not reporting it to the police could add to the author's suspicion, but not reporting doesn't necessarily mean it's a lie. People have various reasons for not reporting, such as fear, shame, or distrust in the system. The author's public accusation might not take that into account.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent potential legal trouble for the sister, but their approach might have been too harsh and public. A more private discussion or involving other family members in a different way could have been better. The fact that the sister is now not speaking to the author shows the emotional impact, which is significant.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the sister's history is a factor, the author's public accusation might be seen as damaging, regardless of their intentions. It's a balance between protecting the sister from potential false accusations and supporting her if she's genuinely a victim. The author's approach might be seen as crossing a line, even if their concerns are understandable.\n\nSo, even though the author might have valid reasons for their skepticism, the way they handled it could be considered wrong because it was public and confrontational without giving the sister the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
