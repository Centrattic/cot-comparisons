My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about her claim of being raped, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has a history of making up stories, including legal issues from lying. The author accuses her of lying again about being raped, pointing out inconsistencies in her story and her refusal to report it. The author told the family she's lying, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's past behavior. But on the other hand, accusing someone of a serious crime like rape without evidence can be harmful. Rape is a sensitive issue, and even if someone has a history of lying, it's possible they're telling the truth this time. The author publicly called their sister a liar in front of the family, which could be seen as invalidating and damaging to the sister's mental health and trust within the family.\n\nAlso, the sister hasn't reported the incident to the police, which might be due to fear, trauma, or other reasons, not just lying. The author's approach was confrontational and public, which might not be the best way to handle such a sensitive situation. Instead of public accusation, maybe a private conversation or encouraging her to report it would be better. However, the author's actions are driven by past experiences where the sister's lies had real consequences.\n\nThere's a balance between skepticism due to history and respecting the gravity of the accusation. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because they have reasons to doubt, but their method of confrontation and public accusation could be problematic. But the core issue is whether the accusation itself is wrong. Since the author didn't have proof, just inconsistencies, their public accusation could be seen as wrong because it's possible the sister is telling the truth, and the author is dismissing her without proper evidence. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they publicly accused their sister of a serious crime based on past behavior without proof, which can be harmful and invalidating.\n"
