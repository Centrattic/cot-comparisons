My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about a rape allegation, given the sister's history of lying. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's sister has a documented history of lying, including legal consequences. The sister's current story about being raped has inconsistencies, like changing the number of attackers and the timeline. The author, in front of the family, accuses the sister of lying, which led to family conflict.\n\nNow, I have to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Rape is a serious crime, and false accusations are also serious. However, the sister's pattern of behavior complicates things. The author might be protecting their family from being manipulated again. But by publicly accusing the sister, the author could be invalidating her experience, regardless of the truth. It's a sensitive issue because if the sister is telling the truth, the author's public accusation could be harmful and traumatic.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's history is significant. The author has evidence that the sister has lied before, which might make them more cautious. The author's approach, however, was in front of the family, which might have been harsh. Maybe a private conversation would have been better to address concerns without public shaming.\n\nI should also consider the potential consequences. If the sister is genuinely a victim, the author's accusation could discourage her from seeking help. If the sister is lying, the author is protecting others from being misled. But the method of confronting her in front of family might not be the best approach, regardless of the intent.\n\nAnother angle: the importance of believing victims. Society often advises people to believe victims, but there's also a need to be cautious with accusations. The author is caught in a tough spot between these two perspectives.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether the approach was appropriate. The author's intent might be valid (protecting family from lies), but the method (public confrontation without evidence) could be harmful. Even with the sister's history, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue can be damaging, especially if the person is a victim.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister refuses to go to the police. That's a red flag for a false accusation, but it's not conclusive. The author's decision to call out the sister in front of the family might have been based on past experiences, but it's possible that the sister is telling the truth this time. The author's approach could be seen as dismissing her trauma, which is wrong regardless of the sister's history.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent might be understandable, but the action taken (publicly accusing without evidence) is problematic. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation could be considered wrong because it's public and potentially traumatic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their skepticism has some basis.\n"
