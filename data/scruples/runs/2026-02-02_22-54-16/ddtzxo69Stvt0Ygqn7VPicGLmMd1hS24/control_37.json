My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is questioning whether it was right to accuse their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal consequences. The author points out inconsistencies in her story and her refusal to report the rape to the police. But the sister is in a lot of emotional distress, and the author's public accusation caused family conflict.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author was justified in publicly confronting their sister. On one hand, the sister's history of lying is significant, with multiple lawsuits and criminal charges. The author might genuinely believe she's lying again. But on the other hand, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing it outright could be harmful. Even if there's a history of lies, accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event can be very damaging, especially in front of family.\n\nThe author mentions that the sister changes her story details, which is a red flag. However, trauma survivors often have fragmented memories and might not remember events exactly as they happened initially. The author's public confrontation could invalidate the sister's experience, regardless of the truth. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author handled it might have been unhelpful and hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author didn't take steps to support the sister, like encouraging her to seek help or report the incident privately. Instead, they made a public accusation. That could have made the sister feel more isolated and less likely to come forward with the truth later, especially if she was actually a victim. The author's motivation might be to protect the family from what they see as the sister's manipulation, but their approach might have caused more harm.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If the sister did fabricate the rape claim, the author's accusation could potentially be seen as defamatory, but since it's within the family context, maybe not. However, the emotional impact on the sister is significant. The author is in a tough spot between protecting the family's trust and respecting the sister's potential trauma.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author believes the sister is lying, the method of confronting her in front of the family without giving her privacy to explain might be wrong. It's important to handle sensitive issues with care, especially when there's a power dynamic within a family. The author could have taken a different approach, like speaking to the sister privately first or involving a professional to mediate.\n\nSo considering all this, the author might be in the wrong not because they don't believe the sister, but because they didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it requires. Even if their conclusion about the sister's truthfulness is correct, the harsh public confrontation could be seen as inappropriate.\n"
