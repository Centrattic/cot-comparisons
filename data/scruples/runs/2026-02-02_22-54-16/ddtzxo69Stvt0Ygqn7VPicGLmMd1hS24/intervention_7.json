My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about accusing rape, given her history of lying. \n\nFirst, the sister has a documented history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. The author is skeptical because the stories keep changing, which is a red flag. The sister refuses to report to the police, which is another concern.\n\nThe author's main point is that the sister's behavior is consistent with her past lies, so they publicly called her out in front of family. The family had mixed reactions, and the sister is now upset. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants to know if others agree.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author's intent was to address a pattern of behavior that has caused legal and personal issues. However, the method\u2014publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter\u2014could be problematic. Even if the sister has lied before, rape is a traumatic experience, and the approach taken might have been dismissive or hurtful. The author might have handled it better by addressing it privately first to avoid shaming her in front of others, which could have exacerbated the situation. \n\nBut given the sister's history, the author's actions might be seen as a protective measure, trying to prevent her from causing more harm. However, the public confrontation could be seen as invalidating her potential trauma, even if the sister has lied before. The key issue is whether the author's method was appropriate, not just the intent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the public accusation in front of the family might be considered wrong because it doesn't take into account the seriousness of the accusation and the emotional impact on the sister. Even if the author believes their sister is lying, the manner of confrontation could be harmful regardless of the sister's past behavior.\n"
