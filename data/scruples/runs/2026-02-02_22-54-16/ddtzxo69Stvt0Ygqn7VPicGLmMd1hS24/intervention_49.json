My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is questioning if they did the right thing by publicly telling their sister they don't believe her when she claimed to be raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention and has been involved in legal issues due to lying. The author points out specific past instances where the sister lied, like faking a knife attack and accusing a teacher when she was caught plagiarizing. The sister's current rape claim has inconsistent details and she's not going to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, which caused a big reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. On one hand, the sister has a documented history of lying, which might lead the author to be skeptical. But on the other hand, making an accusation of rape is extremely serious. Even if someone has a history of lying, it's possible they are telling the truth this time. Dismissing such a serious claim without proper investigation could be harmful.\n\nThe author's approach was to publicly confront the sister, which the sister found hurtful, and the family had mixed reactions. The author's intent was to prevent the sister from lying again and facing legal consequences. But accusing someone of lying about rape, especially in front of others, can be seen as invalidating their experience and potentially re-traumatizing them. Even if the sister has lied before, the author's public confrontation might have been inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the family. The author might have a valid concern about the sister's pattern of behavior, but how to address it. Instead of publicly accusing her, maybe a private and compassionate approach would have been better, perhaps involving authorities or support groups. The author's method, while coming from a place of trying to protect the family and the sister from legal issues, might have been too harsh and dismissive.\n\nAlso, considering the potential consequences: if the sister was actually raped, the author's public accusation could prevent her from seeking help in the future. The author's motivation to prevent her from getting in trouble is there, but the method used could backfire. The sister might feel betrayed and stop trusting the family, making it harder for her to get support if she's telling the truth.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a strong emphasis on believing survivors of sexual assault. However, the author is in a position where they have evidence of the sister's past lies. This creates a complex situation where the author is caught between their knowledge of the sister's history and the need to take rape claims seriously.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's history of lying, the inconsistency in her story, the author's method of public confrontation, and the potential harm of dismissing a possible true claim. The question is whether the author was wrong in their approach.\n\nI think the author made a mistake in how they addressed the situation. While the sister's history is a factor, the author's public accusation could be seen as invalidating and harmful regardless of the sister's past. A more appropriate approach might have been to express concerns privately, seek professional advice, or support the sister while encouraging her to report the incident if it's true. Publicly confronting her in front of the family might have caused more harm than good, even if the author's intentions were to prevent further lies.\n"
