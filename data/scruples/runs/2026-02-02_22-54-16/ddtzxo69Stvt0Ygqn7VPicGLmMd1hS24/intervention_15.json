My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is a sibling who openly accused their sister of lying about being raped in front of the family. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, including past incidents where she lied about being attacked or plagiarizing. The author's reasoning is that given the sister's pattern of dishonesty and inconsistencies in her story, they don't believe her this time either.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the author is pointing out the sister's history of lies, which might make them question the validity of the new claim. On the other hand, accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter as rape is incredibly serious. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim, even if they have a history of lying, can be harmful and discouraging for victims.\n\nBut the sister has been known to lie before. The author mentions that the sister has been successfully sued for slander and libel, and has a history of false police reports. This history complicates things because it's not a simple case of someone making up a story out of nowhere. The author is acting based on prior knowledge of the sister's behavior. However, even with that history, the author should be cautious. Publicly accusing someone of lying in front of the family could further isolate the sister and prevent her from seeking help if the claim is true. Also, the author's approach might come off as insensitive, regardless of their intentions.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's history of lying versus the seriousness of the current claim. The author might be right to be skeptical, but the way they handled it\u2014publicly accusing her in front of the family\u2014could be seen as wrong. The author should have considered the potential consequences, like the sister not coming forward if the story is true, or the family dynamics being strained. Even if the author's intentions were to prevent the sister from getting in trouble due to false accusations, the method of confronting her publicly might not be the best approach.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of believing victims. There's a societal tendency to not believe survivors of sexual assault, which can lead to them not receiving the support they need. While the sister has a history of lying, the author's public accusation could perpetuate that harmful tendency. It's possible that this time, despite the sister's past, she is telling the truth, and the author's response might have prevented her from getting the help she needs. \n\nHowever, the sister's refusal to report the incident to the police and the inconsistencies in her story are red flags. The author's concern about her getting jail time if she's lying is valid in this context. But again, the method of confrontation matters. The author might have been better off discussing their concerns privately with the sister or perhaps with a trusted family member who could mediate, rather than making the accusation in front of everyone.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, despite their valid concerns. Accusing someone of lying about rape is a heavy accusation, and doing so publicly without sufficient evidence (even if there's a history of lying) can be damaging. The appropriate course of action would involve a more private and supportive approach to address the sister's behavior while still considering the possibility that she might be genuine this time.\n"
