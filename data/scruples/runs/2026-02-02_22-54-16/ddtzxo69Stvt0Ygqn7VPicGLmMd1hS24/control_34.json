My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of being a compulsive liar. She's had legal issues from making up stories, like false police reports and plagiarism. The sister's latest claim is about being raped, but the story keeps changing. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the sister's history. If she's known for lying and manipulating, maybe the author has a reason to be skeptical. However, the subject here is a serious accusation of rape. Even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean their current claim is false. Rape is a traumatic event, and people might have different reactions or memory inconsistencies due to trauma. The fact that the sister changed her story could be a red flag, but it's also possible that the trauma affects how she recounts the event.\n\nNext, the author's approach. Publicly calling out the sister in front of the family might have been harsh and could have caused further harm. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the method of confrontation could be seen as dismissive and invalidating. The sister might be in a vulnerable state, and the public confrontation might prevent her from seeking help if she actually was assaulted. The author mentions that the sister refuses to go to the police, which might be genuine fear or another lie. Either way, the author's response could be counterproductive.\n\nEthically, believing someone about a serious crime like rape is important, regardless of their past behavior. However, the author is also protecting their family from potential false claims. There's a conflict between trusting the sister's claim due to its gravity and considering her history of deceit. The author's intentions might be to prevent future harm (like legal trouble for the sister if the claim is false), but the way it was handled could be problematic.\n\nI should also think about the societal implications. If someone who has been a victim of a serious crime is not believed due to their past behavior, that's a problem. The author might be in the wrong for dismissing a serious claim based on the sister's history, even if there's a pattern of lying. But the sister's refusal to report and inconsistent stories add complexity.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, publicly accusing someone of lying about rape is a very sensitive issue. Even if there's suspicion, the appropriate approach might be to handle it privately, offer support, and encourage the sister to seek help or report it to authorities if she chooses. The author's public confrontation could have invalidated the sister's feelings and potentially worsened the situation for both the sister and the family.\n\nSo, considering the balance between protecting the family from false claims and respecting the sister's potential trauma, the author might be in the wrong for their public accusation. The approach taken could have been more supportive and less dismissive. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author handled it might have caused unnecessary harm and dismissed the sister's possible genuine distress.\n"
