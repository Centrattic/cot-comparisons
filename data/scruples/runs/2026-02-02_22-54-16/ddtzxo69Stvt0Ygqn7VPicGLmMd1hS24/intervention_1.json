My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for confronting their sister about potentially lying about being raped. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, including legal issues from false reports. The author publicly called her out in front of the family, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The sister's history of lying is significant. The author mentions multiple instances where the sister fabricated stories with serious consequences, leading to legal actions. The sister's current story about being raped has inconsistencies in details and timing, and she's not reporting it to the police, which raises red flags.\n\nHowever, the core issue is about the author's approach. The author publicly accused the sister of lying in front of the family. Even if the author's suspicions are valid based on past behavior, the method of confrontation might be problematic. Public shaming can be harmful and may not encourage the sister to be honest. It could also damage family relationships irreparably. \n\nThe author's concern is valid\u2014someone who has a pattern of lying might be fabricating another story. But the way they addressed it could be seen as harsh. Even if the sister is lying, the author's public accusation without evidence might be considered insensitive. The right approach might involve more private communication, perhaps suggesting seeking professional help or involving authorities if there are reasonable grounds for belief.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's claim is about a serious crime\u2014rape. Even with a history of lying, it's important to take such claims seriously to avoid dismissing genuine trauma. There's a risk that the author's public accusation could prevent the sister from coming forward in the future if the story is true, though the sister's pattern suggests otherwise. However, the author's own family is divided, indicating that their approach might not have been the best.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of concern and past experiences with the sister's lies, the method of confrontation in a public setting with the family is likely inconsiderate and could be seen as wrong. The balance between truth and the manner of addressing it matters here. So, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but with the nuance that their suspicions might have merit. However, the way they handled it is problematic.\n"
