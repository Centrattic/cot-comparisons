My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that their sister has accused someone of rape, but the author doesn't believe her because she has a history of lying. The author confronted her in front of the family, which caused some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. On one hand, rape is a serious accusation and should be taken seriously. Victims might not come forward immediately, and their stories might change due to trauma. It's important not to dismiss someone's suffering, especially in such a sensitive matter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister has a documented history of lying, including legal consequences. The sister's story is inconsistent, which the author points out. The author's concern might be valid in terms of preventing false accusations, which can have severe consequences for the accused.\n\nHowever, accusing someone of lying without concrete evidence can be harmful. The author's public confrontation in front of the family might have been inappropriate. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author addressed it could have caused emotional harm and potentially discouraged the sister from seeking help if she was genuine.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between skepticism due to past behavior and the gravity of the accusation. The author might be in a tough spot, but dismissing a rape allegation without thorough investigation is risky. The method of confrontation is also questionable\u2014maybe a private discussion would have been better to avoid public shaming.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, if there's a chance the sister is lying, the author should perhaps encourage her to report it through proper channels while expressing concerns privately. But if the sister is indeed a victim, the author's public accusation could be seen as harmful and insensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, there's a lot to unpack. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the public confrontation and the potential harm to the sister's well-being, even if the author's intent was based on prior experiences.\n"
