My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting his sister about claiming she was raped, given her history of lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. The author is skeptical because her story keeps changing, and she's not reporting it to the police. He publicly called her out in front of the family.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong. On one hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing someone's trauma can be hurtful and invalidating. Even if someone has a history of lying, it's not right to accuse them of lying without evidence. The author's public confrontation might have caused harm, and he should have handled it more privately. Also, the sister might be in genuine distress, and his response could prevent her from seeking help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about his sister's pattern of deception and the potential legal consequences if she continues. He might feel that the family needs to be aware of the possibility that she's lying again. However, even with a history of lies, each situation should be evaluated on its own merits. Publicly accusing her could have been done in a better way.\n\nBut the main issue here is the public accusation without evidence. The author didn't provide evidence or support his sister if she was telling the truth. He dismissed her claims in a way that could be harmful, even if his intentions were to prevent her from lying again. The right approach would be to express concerns privately, encourage her to seek help, and support her if she's genuine without making public accusations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he publicly accused his sister of lying without evidence, which can be harmful and invalidates her potential trauma. Even with her history, the method and timing of his response were inappropriate.\n"
