My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about possibly lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, which has led to legal issues in the past. The author is now telling the family they don't believe the sister's claim, which has caused a family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. Rape is a serious and sensitive issue. Even if the sister has a history of lying, accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic experience can be very damaging. The author's approach\u2014confronting the sister in front of the entire family\u2014might have been harsh and public, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. Regardless of the sister's past, the author's method of addressing the situation is questionable.\n\nThe key points are: the author's sister has a documented history of lying, but the author's public confrontation might not have been the right approach. The author's intention might be to prevent future harm if the sister is lying, but the execution could have been more private and supportive. The sister's refusal to report the rape and the changing details are red flags, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive, especially given the seriousness of the accusation.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If the sister is telling the truth, the author's public accusation could further traumatize her and discourage her from seeking help. Even if the sister is lying, the author's approach might have been unkind and could worsen family dynamics. The right approach might involve private discussion, seeking counseling, or encouraging the sister to report it if it's true, rather than publicly calling her out.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the method of confronting the sister was inappropriate, even if the underlying concern is valid. The author should have handled it with more care and privacy to avoid causing additional harm, regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n"
