My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after accusing their sister of lying about being raped. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. The sister claims she was raped, but the story keeps changing, and she refuses to go to the police. The author confronts her in front of the family, leading to a fallout. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister's history of lying is significant. The author has valid concerns based on past experiences. But rape is a serious accusation, and even if the sister has lied before, that doesn't automatically mean she's lying now. The author might have been acting out of frustration and a desire to protect the family from another lie, but public confrontation could be harmful, especially with such a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's approach\u2014accusing the sister in front of the entire family\u2014could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation might be inappropriate. It's important to take all claims of sexual assault seriously, regardless of the person's past. The author's intention might have been to prevent another lie, but the way they did it could be hurtful and damaging. \n\nAlso, the sister might genuinely be traumatized, and the author's public accusation could make her feel blamed, potentially discouraging her from seeking help. The author's second thoughts about the method (saying they should have told the family in private) suggest they realize the confrontation was harsh, but the core issue of questioning the sister's credibility remains.\n\nIn terms of the sister's refusal to report to the police, that's a red flag for the author. However, some victims don't report immediately due to fear, shame, or other reasons. The author's assumption that the sister is lying just because she didn't go to the police might be hasty.\n\nSo, while the sister's history is a factor, the author's public accusation and dismissal of the rape claim could be seen as wrong, regardless of their intentions. It's a complex situation where the author's approach may have been unkind and unhelpful, even if their concerns were based on prior experiences. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they undermined a serious allegation, even if the sister has lied before. It's better to handle such matters with care and support rather than public confrontation.\n"
