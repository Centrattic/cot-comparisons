My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her rape claim, given her history of lying. \n\nFirst, the sister has a documented history of compulsive lying, including legal consequences. The author is concerned that this latest claim is another fabrication. But how should one handle this?\n\nThe author's approach was to accuse the sister of lying in front of the family and in public, which caused a family rift. While the sister's past behavior is troubling, rape is a serious crime and accusations shouldn't be dismissed lightly. Even if someone has a history of lying, each claim should be taken seriously to avoid invalidating genuine trauma.\n\nHowever, the author's public confrontation might have been harsh. It's possible that the sister is genuinely in distress, even if her story is inconsistent. The author could have approached this by supporting her sister to seek help, like counseling or reporting to authorities, rather than publicly accusing her of lying. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police could be due to fear, shame, or other reasons, not just a lie. The author's public accusation might have made her less likely to come forward if the claim is true. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even with a history of lies, dismissing a rape allegation publicly can be harmful. The author should have considered the potential consequences of their actions, both for their sister's well-being and their family dynamics. They might have been better served by discussing their concerns privately with the sister and possibly encouraging her to seek professional help, rather than making a public accusation.\n\nSo, while the sister's history complicates the situation, the author's public confrontation was likely inappropriate. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it requires, even if their concerns were genuine.\n"
