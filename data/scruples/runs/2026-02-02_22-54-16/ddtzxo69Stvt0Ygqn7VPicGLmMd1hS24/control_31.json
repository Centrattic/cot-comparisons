My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is questioning if they were wrong to accuse their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal consequences. The author confronted the sister in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the seriousness of the accusation. Rape is a severe crime, and making false accusations can have serious legal and emotional consequences. However, the sister has a documented history of lying, which the author is using as context. But even with that history, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue could be harmful. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the sister from lying again, but confronting her in front of the family might not have been the best approach. The sister's story changing multiple times and her refusal to report it to the police are red flags, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. It's possible she's in a situation where she's afraid to come forward or is struggling with trauma, which can affect her ability to recall details accurately. \n\nAlso, the author's public confrontation may have invalidated her feelings and could have discouraged her from seeking help if she was actually a victim. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the way they handled it could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The family's mixed reactions and the sister's distress suggest that the approach might have been too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the sister's pattern of lying, which has real-world consequences. They might feel that they're protecting the family from being manipulated again. However, the method of confrontation is crucial. Instead of publicly calling her out, maybe approaching a trusted family member or a professional to mediate would have been better. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, everyone deserves to be heard and believed, but the author is in a position where they have information that could indicate a false claim. However, the author's right to voice concerns must be balanced with the potential harm their words could cause. If the sister is indeed lying, the author is protecting others from being misled. But if the sister is telling the truth, the author's accusation could be causing further harm. \n\nSo, considering all aspects: the sister's history, the author's intent, the method of confrontation, and the potential impact on the sister's well-being, it seems that the author's approach was flawed. Even if their intent was to stop lies, the way they did it could be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their concern was valid.\n"
