My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for accusing his sister of lying about being raped. The scenario involves a sister with a history of lying, and the brother publicly confronting her in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of making up stories, including legal issues from false claims. She's been sued for slander and libel, and even filed a false police report. The brother believes her latest claim about being raped is another lie because the story keeps changing and she's not going to the police. He publicly called her out in front of the family, which led to a fallout.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, the brother's intent was to prevent her from lying again, but the method of confronting her publicly might be problematic. Rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing it outright, even with prior history, can be harmful. The sister's credibility is an issue, but accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event can have severe consequences. It might discourage her from seeking help if it's true, or it could be valid if she's lying again.\n\nLegally, if the sister is lying about being raped, that's a different matter, but the brother isn't in a position to determine that. Publicly accusing her without evidence could damage their relationship and potentially lead to legal issues for him if she decides to take action. Also, the brother's approach might not have been the best\u2014private discussion with family or encouraging her to seek help might be better than public confrontation.\n\nHowever, the brother's actions are driven by past experiences with the sister's lies, and he's trying to protect the family from being manipulated again. But the way he handled it might have been inappropriate, especially given the sensitivity of the topic. The line between protecting the family and causing harm is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the brother's intentions are understandable, but his public confrontation and public accusation might be inconsiderate of the sister's potential trauma and the serious nature of the accusation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" because of the method used and the potential harm caused by publicly accusing someone of lying about rape without due process.\n"
