My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author publicly confronting their sister about possibly lying about being raped, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of making up stories, including serious ones like false police reports and being sued for slander. She's an adult with a documented pattern of deceptive behavior. The author is skeptical because the story details keep changing, and she's not cooperating with the police. The author's main argument is that the sister has a history of lies, so this might be another one. \n\nBut here's the catch: rape is a serious allegation, and even if there's doubt, the appropriate response is crucial. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a trauma could have severe consequences. The author did this in front of the family, which might have added to the sister's distress or silenced her if she were telling the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the sister's pattern and the inconsistencies. They might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated. However, the method of confrontation\u2014publicly and bluntly\u2014could be problematic. Even if the author's skepticism is based on past behavior, the way they expressed it could be harmful, regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report might be for valid reasons (like fear of not being believed, trauma, etc.), but the author assumes it's part of the lie. The author's action might prevent her from seeking help if she's genuinely a victim. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's approach was wrong. While their skepticism might be based on facts, the way they handled it\u2014public confrontation without evidence and dismissing her potential trauma\u2014could be seen as wrong. It's possible that the sister is lying, but the author's response could exacerbate the situation, whether she's truthful or not. The right approach might be to encourage her to report the crime while supporting her privately rather than publicly calling her out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because publicly accusing someone of lying about rape, especially without evidence and in a way that could hinder her from seeking help, is inappropriate regardless of the sister's history.\n"
