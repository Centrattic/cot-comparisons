My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about possible false claims of being raped. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories for attention, leading the author to publicly accuse her of lying in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of compulsive lying, including legal issues from past false reports. The author is concerned because her current story is inconsistent, changing details each time, and she's not reporting it to the police. The author's main issue is that they publicly called out the sister in front of the family, which caused a family rift.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in their skepticism given the sister's history. However, the sister is making a serious allegation\u2014rape\u2014which is a grave accusation and requires careful handling. The author's public confrontation could have invalidated the sister's feelings and potentially discouraged her from seeking help if it's true. There's also the risk that even if the sister is lying now, her past behavior doesn't automatically make this claim false. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive and harmful, especially given the sensitivity of the topic.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's pattern of behavior is concerning and could indicate a pattern of manipulation. The author might feel they're protecting the family from being misled again. However, the method of addressing it in a public setting without giving the sister privacy could be problematic. It's possible that the sister might genuinely be in need of support, even if her past is problematic. The author's public accusation might have caused more harm than good, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, considering the balance between protecting against false claims and supporting someone who might be a victim, the author's approach might be seen as wrong. The right approach would involve addressing the sister's history privately, seeking evidence, supporting her if she's a victim, and maybe involving appropriate authorities rather than public confrontation. The author's actions could be harmful in either case\u2014whether the sister is lying or telling the truth. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
