My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying. She's been in trouble for making up stories for attention, even to the point of being sued and charged with false reports. The sister is now claiming she was raped, changing details each time, and refusing to go to the police. The author, in front of their family, told the sister they don't believe her and called out the inconsistencies, comparing it to her past lies. Now the family is divided, and the author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the sister's history. If she has a documented pattern of lying and being legally punished for it, that's a significant factor. The author might be justified in being skeptical because of this history. However, rape is a serious accusation, and there's a risk of dismissing a genuine victim if someone has a history of lying but this time is telling the truth.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's history of false accusations and the author's public confrontation. The author did bring up valid concerns about inconsistencies in the story and the sister's refusal to report to the police. However, the method of confronting her in front of the family might have been harsh. Even if the author is correct in their suspicion, the way it was handled could have caused additional trauma if the sister is telling the truth this time.\n\nBut given the sister's past, the author might have a reasonable basis for their skepticism. However, the issue is whether calling someone a liar in a public setting is appropriate, regardless of the justification. There's also the ethical consideration of potentially invalidating a real trauma, even if the person has lied before.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent their sister from possibly committing another false accusation. On the other hand, if the sister is being truthful this time, the author's public accusation could be harmful and damaging to the sister's mental health and credibility.\n\nThe dilemma here is between protecting the family from another lie and respecting the sister's potential need for support. The author's approach might have been confrontational and public, which isn't ideal, but their concerns are based on real evidence. It's a tricky situation. The answer could depend on whether the author acted with malicious intent or just a desire to prevent further harm from the sister's lies.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they had reasons based on the sister's history, but the way they handled it might be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong at all. Since the sister's history is substantial, the author's skepticism could be seen as justified, but the public confrontation might not be the best approach. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
