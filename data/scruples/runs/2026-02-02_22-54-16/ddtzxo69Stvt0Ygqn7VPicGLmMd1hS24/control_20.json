My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's sister is accusing someone of rape, but the author doesn't believe her, given her history of lying. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Rape is a serious accusation, and in most places, it's a criminal matter. The author is publicly questioning the credibility of the accusation, which could potentially interfere with any legal process if the sister decides to report it. Even if the sister hasn't gone to the police yet, the author is making a public statement that she's lying. That could be problematic because it might discourage her from coming forward if it's true, or it could damage her credibility if she does.\n\nThe sister's history of lying is presented as evidence, but past behavior doesn't necessarily predict the current situation. The author is dismissing the current claim based on past incidents. However, even compulsive liars can have true stories once in a while. The problem is that the author is publicly accusing the sister without any investigation, which could be seen as harmful regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the author confronted the sister in front of family during an emotional moment. This approach might not be the best way to handle a sensitive issue. It's possible that a private conversation would have been more appropriate, even if the author's conclusion was the same. Publicly shaming someone for a serious accusation like rape is risky and could be considered emotionally abusive, especially if the sister is telling the truth.\n\nThere's also the aspect of due process. The author is taking it upon themselves to judge the sister's credibility without any formal investigation. The legal system is designed to handle such accusations with proper procedures. By making a public accusation, the author might be violating their sister's rights, even if their intent was to prevent false claims.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the sister's history is a valid reason to be skeptical. But even with that, the manner in which the author addressed the situation is questionable. The author could have approached the family privately first or advised the sister to report the incident properly. Publicly confronting her in this way, especially in front of others, could be seen as invalidating her experience, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely caused harm and could be seen as wrong. The way they handled the situation\u2014public confrontation without a private discussion, dismissing a serious allegation based on past behavior, and potentially discouraging the sister from seeking help\u2014are all problematic. Even if the sister is lying, the approach taken by the author isn't appropriate.\n"
