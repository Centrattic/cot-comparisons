My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after confronting their sister about allegedly lying about being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports and lawsuits. The author is skeptical because the story keeps changing and the sister isn't reporting it to the police. The author publicly called out the sister in front of family, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethical aspects. On one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's past behavior. They're trying to prevent potential harm if the sister's story is false, maybe even legal consequences. But on the other hand, making such an accusation in public, especially about a serious crime like rape, could be harmful if the sister is telling the truth. Even if the sister has lied before, it's possible she's genuinely a victim this time. \n\nRape is a sensitive issue, and victims often don't report it immediately due to trauma. The author's approach might have been confrontational and dismissive, which could prevent the sister from getting the support she needs if it's true. The author did have reasons to be cautious, but the way they handled it\u2014publicly calling her out without private discussion first\u2014might be seen as insensitive or invalidating. \n\nThe sister's refusal to report could be due to fear, shame, or other reasons, not necessarily that she made it up. The author's assumption that she's lying again might be projecting past behavior onto a new situation without giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even if the sister has lied before, each situation is different. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might have caused emotional harm, regardless of the truth. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can damage relationships and trust. The author's intention was to stop the sister from lying, but the method could be considered harsh and lacking in empathy. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, there's a balance between skepticism and support. While the author's concerns are understandable, the public confrontation and dismissal might have crossed the line. The correct approach might have been to express concerns privately, seek evidence, or encourage the sister to report the incident without publicly invalidating her experience. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they publicly doubted the sister's claim without a less confrontational approach, potentially disregarding the possibility of genuine trauma and causing harm regardless of the truth.\n"
