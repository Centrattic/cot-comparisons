My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister has a history of making up stories, including some serious ones like false police reports and being sued for lying. Now the sister is claiming she was raped, and the author doesn't believe her and told the family she's lying. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. The author mentions that the sister has a pattern of compulsive lying, with legal consequences and multiple instances of fabricating stories. That's a strong background. However, even with a history of lying, the current claim is about a serious crime\u2014rape. It's important to note that rape is a grave accusation, and the response to such a claim needs to be handled with care.\n\nThe author confronts the sister in front of the entire family, accusing her of lying. While the author might have valid concerns based on the sister's past, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly and confrontationally\u2014might not be the best approach. Public shaming could prevent the sister from seeking help if she was genuinely assaulted. Also, even if the sister has lied before, it's possible that this time could be real, and dismissing it outright could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is worried about the sister's tendency to lie and the potential for this to lead to further legal issues. The author is trying to protect the family from being deceived again. But the key point is that the author is making a judgment without evidence. The sister hasn't provided consistent details, and while that's suspicious, it doesn't necessarily prove she's lying. People who have experienced trauma might have fragmented memories, so changing stories can be a sign of distress rather than deceit.\n\nThe author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the method was harsh and public. It's possible that a more supportive approach, like encouraging the sister to seek professional help or involving a counselor, would have been more appropriate. The author's words might have invalidated the sister's feelings, regardless of the truth, which could cause further harm. Also, the sister's refusal to report the incident to the police is a red flag, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. There are many reasons someone might not report a rape, including fear, shame, or distrust in the system.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is in a difficult position. They have to balance their sister's history with the gravity of the current accusation. However, the public confrontation and the direct accusation of lying might be considered wrong because they don't take into account the possibility that the sister could be telling the truth this time, even if unlikely. It's also important to consider the impact on the sister's mental health and the family dynamics.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for suspicion, the way they handled the situation could be seen as wrong. They should have approached it more sensitively, perhaps by discussing it privately or involving professionals who can assess the situation without judgment. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter, especially in front of family, can be hurtful and may prevent the person from seeking the help they need if they are genuinely a victim. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their concerns are based on the sister's past behavior.\n"
