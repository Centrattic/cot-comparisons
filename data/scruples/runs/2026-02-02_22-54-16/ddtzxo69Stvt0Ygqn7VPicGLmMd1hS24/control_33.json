My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author publicly confronting their sister for allegedly lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false claims. The author is now questioning their approach after causing a family backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's history of lying is significant\u2014suing others for slander, false police reports, etc. But the author publicly accused her of lying about a serious allegation like rape. Even if the sister has a pattern, calling someone a liar in front of family, especially regarding such a sensitive issue, could be seen as harmful. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim, even if they have a history, can be very damaging. It might prevent her from seeking help if it's true, or worsen her mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. They've been dealing with the sister's lies for years, and the sister's inconsistency in the story is troubling. The author is worried about the sister getting into legal trouble again. However, the method of confrontation\u2014publicly shaming her in front of the family\u2014might not be the best approach. It could make the sister feel attacked, leading to further emotional harm. The author might have a point in suspecting a lie, but the way they expressed it could be considered inconsiderate and hurtful, regardless of their intentions.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of believing survivors. Even if someone has a history of lying, it's important not to dismiss their claims without evidence. The author didn't provide evidence of the sister lying in this case, just past behavior. Assuming the worst could be harmful. The author's approach might have been too harsh, lacking support for the sister if she's telling the truth this time.\n\nBut then again, the sister's refusal to report to the police and changing stories might justify the author's skepticism. However, it's crucial to handle such situations with care. Maybe the author should have discussed it privately with the sister or a trusted authority instead of making a public accusation. Publicly calling someone a liar, especially regarding a serious allegation, is likely to be seen as the wrong approach, regardless of the sister's history.\n\nIn terms of the family's reaction, some agreeing with the author and others not suggests there's no clear right answer. However, the key point is the method used. Public confrontation in sensitive matters is often counterproductive. The author might not be in the wrong for their concerns but is definitely in the wrong for how they expressed those concerns.\n"
