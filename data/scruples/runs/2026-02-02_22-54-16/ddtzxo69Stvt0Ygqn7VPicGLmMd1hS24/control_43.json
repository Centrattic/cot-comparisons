My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her alleged rape, given the sister's history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all the details provided. The sister has a documented history of lying, including legal consequences. She's been sued for slander and libel, and has false police reports on her record. The author is concerned because the sister's story keeps changing, and she's not reporting it to the police.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's public accusation that the sister is lying. The sister's claim is a serious one\u2014rape. Even if there's a history of lies, accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event in front of family could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The author might not be wrong in their skepticism, especially with the sister's past, but the way they handled it\u2014publicly calling out the sister in front of the family\u2014could be damaging. It might invalidate the sister's experience if she is telling the truth, and even if she isn't, the public confrontation could exacerbate family tensions and harm the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is protecting their family from what they perceive as repeated manipulation. They might feel that the sister is using the rape claim as another attention-seeking ploy. However, even with the sister's history, it's important to approach such sensitive issues with care. The author could have chosen a more private and supportive method to address their concerns, perhaps speaking to the sister alone or involving a professional.\n\nThe key here is that regardless of the sister's past, the author's public accusation without providing a safe, private space for discussion might be considered wrong. The sister's claim, even if likely false, deserves sensitivity. The author's approach could have been better, so the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, in terms of right or wrong, publicly denouncing someone's trauma, regardless of context, is generally considered wrong because it can retraumatize the victim and discourage them from seeking help.\n"
