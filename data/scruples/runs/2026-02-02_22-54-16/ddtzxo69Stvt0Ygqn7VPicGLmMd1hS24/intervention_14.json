My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about possible lying regarding a rape claim. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, legal issues, and inconsistencies in her story. The author's main concern is that the sister is making up stories again, but the family is upset because the author called her out in front of everyone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the sister's history of lying might justify the author's skepticism. However, accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a heavy charge, especially in a public setting. The author's approach could be seen as confrontational and potentially harmful, regardless of the sister's past behavior.\n\nNext, the legal angle. Even if the sister is lying, the author's public accusation might have legal repercussions if the sister sues for defamation. The author's statement in front of the family could be used as evidence in a lawsuit, especially if the sister takes it to court. The author's justification based on past incidents might not hold up legally, as each situation is unique.\n\nThen there's the emotional impact. The sister is already in a vulnerable state, and the author's public accusation might exacerbate the trauma if the story is true. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation\u2014publicly shaming her in front of family\u2014could be damaging. It's possible that the sister might feel even more isolated and less likely to seek help if she's being dismissed outright.\n\nThe inconsistency in the sister's story is a red flag, but it's important to note that trauma can cause memory gaps or inconsistencies. The fact that the sister refuses to report to the police is concerning, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. There are many reasons someone might not come forward, including fear, shame, or distrust in the system.\n\nThe author's intention was to call out a pattern of behavior, but the method was confrontational and public. Maybe a more private approach, involving family members or professionals, would have been better. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might not be the most constructive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author has valid reasons to be skeptical, making a public accusation without proper evidence or support could be seen as crossing a line. The sister's history doesn't automatically invalidate her current claim, and the author's approach might have dismissed her potential trauma without due consideration.\n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014ethical, legal, emotional\u2014the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might indeed be in the wrong because of the public confrontation and the potential harm caused, regardless of their suspicions about the sister's truthfulness.\n"
