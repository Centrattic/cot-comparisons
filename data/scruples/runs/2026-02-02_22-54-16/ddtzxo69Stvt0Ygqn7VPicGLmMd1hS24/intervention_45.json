My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about possibly lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories to gain attention, including legal issues from false reports. The author publicly called her out in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. On one hand, the author is pointing out the sister's pattern of lying, which has real consequences. The sister's past behavior, like false police reports and lawsuits, gives the author some grounds to be skeptical. The author is also concerned about potential legal trouble if the sister's claim is false. However, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright can be harmful and invalidating. Even if there's a history of lies, assuming someone is lying about such a traumatic event can cause further trauma and prevent them from seeking help.\n\nThe author's approach was public confrontation, which might have been hurtful and not the best way to handle the situation. Maybe a more private discussion with the sister and family, or involving authorities if there's evidence of falsification, could be more appropriate. But the author's intent seems to be protecting the sister from getting in trouble and preventing family from being misled. However, the method used might be wrong, even if the concern is valid.\n\nThe key points are: the sister's history of lies, the seriousness of the accusation, and the public confrontation. The author's actions might have been wrong because they invalidated the sister's claim in a public setting, which can be damaging. But if the sister is indeed lying, the author's skepticism is understandable. However, even with the sister's history, accusing someone of lying about rape is a heavy claim that needs careful handling. The author might not be in the wrong in intent but perhaps in the method. The answer hinges on whether the approach was appropriate given the context.\n"
