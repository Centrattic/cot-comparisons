My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about the person publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped, based on her history of compulsive lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister has a history of making up stories, even to the point of legal consequences. The author is skeptical because the story details keep changing and she's not reporting it to the police. However, the main issue is that the author publicly called out the sister in front of the family, which caused a family rift.\n\nNow, I need to weigh the ethical aspects. On one hand, the sister's history is significant\u2014multiple lawsuits, false police reports, etc. The author's concern is that the sister is fabricating another story. On the other hand, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing someone's claim, even if they have a history of lying, could be harmful. The author did confront the sister publicly, which might have been unkind regardless of the truth.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as wrong because even if the sister is lying, the method of confronting her in front of the family could be considered cruel. Also, while there's a history of lying, it's possible the sister is telling the truth this time. The author didn't take steps to verify or offer support, just publicly accused her. That could be seen as invalidating her experience and adding harm. \n\nBut then again, the author's concern is valid given the sister's past. However, the way it was handled might have been inappropriate. The author should have perhaps discussed privately or advised the sister to report it officially. Publicly calling her out, even with justification, might be seen as inconsiderate and damaging.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public confrontation and not handling it more sensitively, despite the sister's history. Even if the author's intent was to prevent another lie, the method was harmful. It's important to validate someone's experience unless there's clear evidence, and public accusation can exacerbate trauma if the person is telling the truth.\n"
