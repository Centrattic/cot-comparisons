My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after accusing their sister of lying about being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, including legal issues from false reports. The author is skeptical because the story keeps changing and the sister won't report it to the police. They confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are about supporting a family member's trauma and respecting their autonomy. Even if the sister has lied before, the author's public accusation might be harmful. It's important to note that rape is a serious crime, and dismissing someone's claim can be extremely damaging. The sister might be in genuine distress, and the author's approach could prevent her from seeking help if it's true. \n\nThe author's intention was to expose the lie based on past behavior, but the method\u2014calling her out in front of the family\u2014lacks support and could invalidate her feelings. The right approach might have been to express concern privately and encourage her to seek help, rather than publicly accusing her. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to go to the police and changing stories could have legitimate reasons. Maybe she's scared, traumatized, or doesn't know the exact details. The author might be jumping to conclusions based on past behavior without considering the current situation's nuances.\n\nSo, even though the sister has a history of lying, the author's public confrontation and dismissal of the claim without proper support or verification is problematic. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with the necessary care and respect for their sister's potential trauma.\n"
