My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author's sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from lying. Now the sister is claiming she was raped, but the story keeps changing, and there's no police report. The author confronted the sister in front of the family, accused her of lying, and caused a big reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. On one hand, rape is a very serious and sensitive issue. If someone is a victim, they need support, not accusations. The author's public confrontation could be seen as validating the sister's trauma or attacking her credibility. Even if the sister has a history of lying, the author's approach might have been harsh and public, which could be harmful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister's pattern of compulsive lying is well-documented, with multiple legal consequences. The author might be trying to prevent the sister from causing further harm, like getting in legal trouble again. The author's concern is that the sister's false claims could lead to real consequences this time, especially with the ongoing #MeToo movement. The sister's inconsistency in her story adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe author's method of confronting her in front of the family might be where they went wrong. Even if the sister has a history of lying, addressing it publicly could be seen as shaming her and not taking her potential trauma seriously. It's possible that the sister is genuinely in distress, and the public accusation could have made her feel isolated or dismissed.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect their family and prevent potential false accusations. The key point is whether the author had a right to publicly accuse their sister without evidence. While the sister's past behavior is a factor, the author's response might have been too confrontational and public. A more private approach, perhaps suggesting legal steps or seeking professional help, might have been more appropriate.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the situation is complex. The author might be justified in their skepticism given the sister's history, but the way they addressed it could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the public confrontation was the right approach, regardless of the sister's past behavior. So, the author could be in the wrong because of how they handled the situation, even if their concerns were valid.\n"
