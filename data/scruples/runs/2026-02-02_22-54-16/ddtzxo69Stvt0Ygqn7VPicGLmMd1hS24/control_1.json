My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, which is a key point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape can be extremely damaging. Even if the sister has a history of lies, the author's approach might be problematic. Publicly confronting her in front of the family could have added emotional harm, especially during a vulnerable moment.\n\nThe sister is not reporting this to the police, which might make the author think she's fabricating the story. But there are reasons why someone might not report a rape, such as fear, trauma, or distrust in the system. The author's sister might have valid reasons, even if the timeline is inconsistent. However, the author brings up past instances where their sister's lies had real consequences, including legal ones. That complicates things because there's a documented pattern.\n\nBut the issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the sister has lied before, it's not fair to assume she's lying now without evidence. The author's public accusation could be seen as dismissing a potential serious claim and contributing to a hostile environment. Support is crucial in such cases, and the author's reaction might have shut down any possibility of support if the sister is being truthful this time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the sister's history and the inconsistencies in the story. They might be trying to prevent a false report from causing more damage. However, the approach of directly confronting her in front of the family without seeking other avenues first (like counseling or involving a professional) could be unwise. \n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between protecting against false claims and supporting a possible victim. Even with a history, it's important to take the claim seriously and not make public accusations that could invalidate her experience. The author might have acted out of frustration, but the method and context of the accusation are crucial. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
