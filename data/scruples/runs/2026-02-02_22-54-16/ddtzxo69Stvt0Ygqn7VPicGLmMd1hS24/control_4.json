My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, even being sued for slander and libel, and has a pattern of making up stories for attention. The author points out inconsistencies in the sister's story\u2014like the number of attackers and the timeline\u2014and her refusal to report to the police. The author called her out in front of the family, which caused a big reaction. Now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's history. If she's been a compulsive liar with legal issues because of her lies, that's a significant point. But rape is a serious accusation, and even if someone has lied before, that doesn't necessarily mean they're lying this time. The author is taking a public stance, which could be harmful if the sister is actually a victim. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue could be retraumatizing and might discourage her from seeking help if it's true. On the other hand, if the sister is indeed lying again, the author might be trying to protect the family from being deceived.\n\nThe key here is the approach. The author confronted the sister in front of the entire family, which could be seen as harsh and dismissive. Even if there's reason to suspect the sister is lying, the method of addressing it might be inappropriate. The author should have considered private discussion first, perhaps involving authorities or professionals, rather than making a public accusation. Also, the sister's refusal to report could be for various reasons\u2014fear, shame, or uncertainty\u2014not necessarily because it's a lie. The author is assuming bad faith without conclusive evidence.\n\nAnother angle is the societal context. There's a tendency to disbelieve victims of sexual assault, which can be part of the problem. The author's public skepticism might contribute to that environment, making it harder for the sister to come forward if she was genuinely assaulted. Even if the sister has lied before, it's important not to invalidate potential trauma. The author's approach might be seen as invalidating the sister's feelings and experiences, regardless of the truth.\n\nHowever, the author isn't in a position to judge the sister's credibility definitively. They're making assumptions based on past behavior, but each situation is different. The sister might have valid reasons for changing her story (like trauma affecting memory) or not reporting immediately. The author's public confrontation could have caused further harm, regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n\nSo, even if the author believes the sister is lying, the way they handled it\u2014publicly accusing her without allowing for private discussion or professional involvement\u2014might be wrong. The wrong isn't necessarily in doubting the sister's story but in the method of addressing it. The author should have approached it more sensitively, perhaps by expressing concerns privately and suggesting professional help or reporting, rather than outright public accusation.\n"
