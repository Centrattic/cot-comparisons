My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including serious ones that led to legal consequences. The sister now claims she was raped, but her story has inconsistencies in details and she's not reporting it to the police. The author confronts the sister in front of the family, accusing her of lying, which causes a family uproar.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's history of lies leading to legal issues, the author's concern about the sister making up another story, and the author's public confrontation. The author justifies their actions by pointing out the sister's pattern and the inconsistencies in the new claim.\n\nNow, considering potential ethical angles. On one hand, the author is trying to prevent the sister from potentially creating more legal trouble by lying again. They're based on past behavior. On the other hand, making such an accusation publicly, especially in a sensitive matter like rape, is a serious thing. Rape is a grave issue, and even with a history of lies, the author's public accusation could be seen as dismissive and harmful, regardless of the sister's past.\n\nBut the author also mentions that the sister's story changes and she refuses to report it, which might be red flags. However, in real-world terms, even if someone has a history of lying, it's not ethical to publicly accuse them of lying without concrete evidence, especially in a sensitive context. The author's approach may have caused more harm by invalidating the sister's possible trauma, even if the sister might be lying.\n\nAnother angle: the author's method. Confronting in front of the entire family might not be the best approach. It could have been handled privately first. But the author's reasoning is that they've put up with it for so long and wanted to address it head-on.\n\nLegal vs. moral wrongs: The sister's past actions are legally documented, but the author's public accusation could be a moral issue. Even if the sister is lying, the author's response might not be appropriate. Supporting someone's claim without evidence is different than publicly accusing them of lying without evidence. The author's action could be seen as inconsiderate and harmful, regardless of their intentions.\n\nAlso, the author's own history of the sister's lies doesn't give them the right to make such a public accusation. Even if the sister might be lying, the way the author handled it could be wrong. It's possible that the sister is genuinely traumatized, and the author's public confrontation is dismissive of that trauma.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they publicly accused their sister without evidence, potentially invalidating her experience, even if there were concerns. The method and context of the accusation matter a lot here. Even if the sister has lied before, the author's approach was confrontational and public, which is likely to be damaging regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n"
