My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being a compulsive liar. She's been in legal trouble for things like slander, libel, and filing false police reports. That's a lot of red flags. The author's sister has changed her story multiple times about the rape, which is a big deal because consistency is important in such serious claims. Also, she's not going to the police, which is another concern. The author, knowing the sister's history, decides to confront her in front of the entire family, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to do that. The key points here are about how to handle someone else's possible false claims, especially when the topic is as sensitive as rape. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the family from being manipulated and prevent potential legal issues if the sister's story is a lie. On the other hand, accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can be damaging, even if there are reasons to doubt the claim.\n\nRape is an extremely traumatic experience, and survivors might not report it immediately or might have inconsistent stories due to trauma. However, in this case, the sister's pattern of lying and changing stories complicates things. The author's approach was to publicly accuse the sister, which could be seen as invalidating her experience if she's telling the truth. That's a problem because it's important to support victims, even while being cautious about the possibility of a false claim.\n\nThe author's method of confrontation in front of the family might have been harsh. Even if the sister is lying, calling her out publicly without private discussion first could be unkind and harmful. The author's intention might have been to prevent further lies, but the way they did it could have made the sister feel shamed or disbelieved, which is not helpful regardless of her truthfulness.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own judgment. While the sister has a history of lies, that's not definitive proof this time is a lie. The author should probably consider the possibility that, despite the sister's past, this could be a genuine case. However, given the sister's history, the author might have a reasonable suspicion. The problem is how to handle that suspicion appropriately.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to balance belief in victims with awareness of potential manipulation. The author's public accusation might have crossed a line, even if their concerns were valid. A better approach might have been to discuss privately with the sister and maybe the family first, rather than making an outright public accusation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were likely wrong because they publicly accused their sister without a more measured approach, which could have hurt her even if she's lying. It's possible they have valid concerns, but the method was inappropriate.\n"
