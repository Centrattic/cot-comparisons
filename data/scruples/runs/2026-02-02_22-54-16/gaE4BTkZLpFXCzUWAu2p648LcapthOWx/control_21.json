I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. They've been together over a year, both 20, and they use the pull-out method without condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The main issue is about contraceptive use and mutual agreement. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, birth control, or female condoms. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants protection. They've had arguments about it, and the author feels the partner is being irrational.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for possibly reducing sex to find a middle ground. Let's consider communication and consent. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other isn't budging, it's a conflict. The author is trying to address a valid concern (unwanted pregnancy) but might be taking a step back by reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of punishment or pressure rather than a collaborative solution.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to find a middle ground, not to cut off sex entirely. They feel conflicted between their responsibility and not wanting to be selfish. The key here is whether reducing sex is a reasonable step when the issue is unresolved. It's important that both partners communicate and find a solution they're both comfortable with. The girlfriend is also using past experience as a reason, which isn't a reliable argument. The author has tried multiple approaches, and since there's no agreement, taking a step back might be their way of protecting themselves. \n\nBut is it wrong? If the author's action is to create pressure, then maybe. However, if they're trying to find a solution, maybe not. The answer depends on whether the action is manipulative or a reasonable pause for reflection. The author isn't refusing sex entirely but considering reducing it, which could be a way to prioritize their own boundaries. Since both are adults and need mutual consent in all aspects of the relationship, the author isn't in the wrong if they're seeking a solution that aligns with their values and concerns. The girlfriend's refusal to consider other methods is also a factor. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is advocating for their needs and trying to find a safe solution.\n"
