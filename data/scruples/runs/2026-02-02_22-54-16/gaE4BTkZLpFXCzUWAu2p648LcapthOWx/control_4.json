I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection except the pull-out method, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the couple has been together over a year, both 20, no protection except pull-out. The author has tried to push for condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, citing past relationships and dislike of condom feel. They've also discussed other methods like birth control and female condoms, which she's against. The author is conflicted between wanting to prevent pregnancy and feeling it's selfish to limit sex.\n\nNow, the ethics here. The author's main concern is responsible behavior regarding potential pregnancy. The girlfriend is relying on pull-out and her past luck, which is risky. The author is trying to communicate his concerns and safety needs. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering reducing sex to find a compromise.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, both have the right to sexual autonomy. However, the author is prioritizing safety, which is valid. The girlfriend isn't using any method except pull-out, which isn't reliable. The author's actions (reducing sex) might be seen as a way to enforce safety without forcing her to use methods she's against. But does that make him wrong?\n\nAlternatively, could the author be wrong? If he's pressuring her to use methods she's uncomfortable with, that might be an issue. But since they've discussed alternatives and she's unwilling, the author is asserting his needs. It's a balance between mutual respect and individual safety. The author isn't trying to control her, just to find a middle ground. The fact that he's considering reducing sex to avoid conflict while seeking a solution might be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
