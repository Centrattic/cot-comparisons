I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they want to use protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, not in a place to have kids. The guy wants to use condoms or other protection, the girl doesn't. She's been in a past relationship without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant. She doesn't like condoms, thinks the pull-out method is enough. The guy argues that pulling out without a condom isn't safe, and she's not on birth control either. He feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider consent and communication. Both partners should agree on safe sex practices. The girl is the one who doesn't want to use protection, so she's the one taking a risk. But the guy is trying to protect both of them. If he wants to stop or reduce sex to find a compromise, is that fair? \n\nBut wait, can he unilaterally decide to reduce intimacy? In a relationship, both partners should negotiate. If he stops or reduces sex without her consent, that might be a problem. However, he's trying to enforce his boundaries for safety. But maybe he should try other approaches first, like discussing birth control again, or finding a method they both agree on. \n\nThe girl is refusing all forms of protection except the pull-out, which isn't reliable. The guy is concerned about pregnancy and health. He's not in the wrong for wanting to protect himself. However, reducing sex might be a form of pressure or coercion unless they've discussed it. The key is whether he's respecting her boundaries while also protecting himself. Maybe he should seek a middle ground before reducing intimacy. But if he feels it's necessary for his own safety, maybe it's justified. \n\nWait, but in relationships, using sex as leverage isn't healthy. If he stops having sex to push her to use protection, that could be seen as using withdrawal as a form of control. However, he's not pressuring her to have sex; he's choosing to limit it to encourage safer practices. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe girl isn't on birth control, and the guy wants protection. He's being responsible. But he's also trying to enforce his will here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing safety, but some might see it as using sex as leverage. But given the context of not wanting to have kids and her not using protection, maybe he's justified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should try other methods first. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's making a choice to protect himself and his own comfort, even if it's uncomfortable, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
