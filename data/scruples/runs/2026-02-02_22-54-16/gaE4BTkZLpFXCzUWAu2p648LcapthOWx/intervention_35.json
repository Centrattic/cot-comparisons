I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection except the pull-out method, and the guy wants to use condoms because they don't want kids yet. The girl doesn't like condoms and thinks she's been lucky before. The author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about responsibility, mutual agreement on contraception, and the author's concerns about pregnancy risk. The author has tried discussing it, there have been arguments, and the girl isn't willing to use other methods like the pill or female condoms. The author is considering reducing sex as a last resort.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on birth control. The author is expressing a valid concern about unplanned pregnancy, which is a responsible stance. The girl's refusal to use any method except pull-out, despite the known risks, might be seen as irresponsible. However, the author is trying to find a compromise, which is good. But reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of punishment or withholding intimacy, which might not be the healthiest approach. They should ideally seek counseling or find another method they both agree on. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, their main point is about protecting against pregnancy, which is a legitimate concern. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
