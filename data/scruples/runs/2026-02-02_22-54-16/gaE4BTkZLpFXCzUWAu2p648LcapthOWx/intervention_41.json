I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend over the use of protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together a year, both 20, and they're not using any protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms because of the risk of pregnancy, which he can't handle economically or emotionally. The girl doesn't want to use them, saying she's never used them before, they don't feel good, and she's been lucky so far. They've argued, and he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to analyze both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy. He's responsible about his current life situation and is advocating for safety. Using protection is a common and responsible choice, especially when both are young and not ready for kids. The girl's argument is that she's been fine before, but that's a past relationship. The pull-out method isn't 100% effective, and relying on it is risky. The guy is trying to address this risk, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has her preferences and comfort. She doesn't like condoms, and maybe she's not willing to switch to other methods like the pill or female condoms. The author is considering reducing sex because he can't compromise, but is that fair? It's a significant step. The author might be trying to respect her by not forcing the issue, but he's also setting boundaries for his own comfort. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and compromise. The guy is trying to set boundaries based on his concerns, which is okay. If he's uncomfortable with the current level of risk, it's reasonable for him to seek a solution. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of pressure if the girl isn't open to changing her stance. But in this case, the author is trying to find a middle ground, not necessarily push his will. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Probably not. He's acting in his own best interest and the relationship's. The girl isn't budging, and he can't take that risk. So, he's trying to find a way to protect himself without being coercive. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
