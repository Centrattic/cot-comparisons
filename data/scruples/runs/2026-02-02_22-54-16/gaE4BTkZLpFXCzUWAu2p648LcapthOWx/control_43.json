I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. The main issue here is about consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together over a year. They're both 20, not using protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to get her to use condoms before, but she's resistant. Now he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't want to risk an unintended pregnancy, but he also doesn't want to impose his will on her. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual consent and compromise. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on the level of risk they're comfortable with. The author is concerned about not using protection, which is a valid health and financial concern. His girlfriend, on the other hand, is not willing to use condoms due to preference and past experiences. She might be relying on luck, which is risky.\n\nThe author is considering reducing sex to push for a compromise. But is that fair? If they can't reach an agreement, then maybe the author is within his rights to set boundaries that protect his own interests. However, communication is crucial. Has he tried other methods of birth control that she might be open to? The scenario mentions female condoms and the pill, but she's against those. Maybe there's another method they haven't discussed?\n\nBut if she's not willing to use any form of protection, the author has the right to prioritize his own well-being. Stopping sex could be a way to enforce his boundaries, especially if he's not comfortable with the current arrangement. However, it's important that this decision is made through open dialogue, not just unilaterally. If the author communicates his reasons clearly and they still can't agree, then his decision to limit sex might be justified.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's reasons for not using condoms are personal. If she's not willing to budge, maybe the author is right to reconsider their physical relationship. It's a balance between respecting her autonomy and his own needs. But is he in the wrong for wanting to protect himself? Probably not. The wrong would be if he forced her to use protection against her will without mutual agreement. Since he's considering reducing sex as a middle ground, he's trying to find a compromise. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
