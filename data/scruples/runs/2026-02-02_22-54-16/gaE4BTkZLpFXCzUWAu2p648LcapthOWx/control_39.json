I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend refused. She argues she's never used condoms before, didn't get pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. The author feels she's being irrational and is now considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants to use protection. The girlfriend is against it, citing past experience and comfort. The author is considering reducing sex to push for a compromise. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author has tried discussing it, but there's been no resolution. The girlfriend isn't open to alternatives like the pill or female condoms. The author's main concern is about being responsible and avoiding pregnancy. They feel it's a safety issue, while the girlfriend values pleasure and past experiences. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The author isn't using coercion or violence. Ethically, it's about mutual consent and shared decisions. The author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure if the girlfriend isn't in agreement. But since they haven't reached an agreement, the author is taking steps to prioritize their own comfort and safety.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they reduce sex to encourage a compromise, it's a form of non-physical pressure. In some views, this could be manipulative. However, the author is trying to address a real concern. The girlfriend isn't compromising either. It's a tough spot. The author isn't forcing her to use protection but is using their own actions to push for a safer approach. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should have mutual respect and compromise. The author's actions are a response to their partner's unwillingness to find a middle ground. Since the girlfriend isn't open to alternatives, the author is left with options like reducing sex to avoid risk. It's a difficult situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to make a decision that protects them from potential pregnancy, especially if they feel the current method is too risky. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting in their own best interest and trying to resolve a conflict that the girlfriend isn't addressing.\n"
