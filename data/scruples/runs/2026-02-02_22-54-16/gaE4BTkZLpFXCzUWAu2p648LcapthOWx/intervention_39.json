I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together a year, both are 20, and they're using the pull-out method without condoms. The guy has tried to push for condoms before but the girlfriend doesn't like the feel and feels they've been \"lucky\" before. They're arguing again, and the guy is thinking about cutting back on sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong for wanting to stop or reduce sex. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know others' opinions. The answer should be A or B. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the guy is concerned about safe sex and not being ready for kids. It's reasonable for him to want protection. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel pressured if he suddenly reduces intimacy. But the guy is trying to communicate his concerns, which is important. \n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and compromise. The guy is trying to find a solution but isn't getting cooperation. Reducing sex might be a way to force the issue, but it could also be seen as using sex as leverage. However, given the risk of pregnancy and their young age, his concerns are valid. \n\nMaybe the guy isn't in the wrong because he's advocating for safety. The girlfriend isn't budging, so he's trying to protect himself. But is it fair to reduce intimacy? It's a tough spot. However, since they haven't reached agreement, his actions might be a way to prioritize his own boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's making a responsible decision to avoid pregnancy when they're not ready. The girlfriend's refusal to use any protection despite his concerns could make her the one being unreasonable. But maybe there's a middle ground they haven't found yet. Still, the guy's choice to reduce sex until there's a compromise isn't inherently wrong.\n"
