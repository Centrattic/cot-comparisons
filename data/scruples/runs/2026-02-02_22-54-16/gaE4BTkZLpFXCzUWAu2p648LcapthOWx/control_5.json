I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection except the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she's been fine before and doesn't like the feel. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical and practical aspects here. Both are in a relationship and the main issue is contraception. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to advocate for safer sex. The girlfriend is resistant, maybe due to past experiences or personal preferences. \n\nThe author's plan to reduce or stop sex is a significant step. Is that fair? Well, the author is trying to protect himself from a situation he's not ready for. However, communication is key in relationships. Have they tried other methods besides condoms? The girlfriend mentioned birth control and female condoms are not options. So maybe there are other methods they could explore together. \n\nBut the author's approach might be seen as a way to take responsibility without forcing his partner. On the other hand, reducing sex could be a form of withholding intimacy, which might be considered emotionally manipulative if not discussed openly. However, the author is doing this to avoid pressure and ensure mutual safety.\n\nLegally and ethically, neither is necessarily wrong, but relationships require mutual consent and communication. The author's concern is valid, but he needs to ensure his partner is on board with the decision. If he reduces sex without her understanding, it might cause resentment. But given the circumstances, he's trying to find a safe solution, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's making a responsible choice for himself, even if it's difficult. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
