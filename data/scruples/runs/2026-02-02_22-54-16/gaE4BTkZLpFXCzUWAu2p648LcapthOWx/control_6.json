I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and doesn't want to have kids right now due to economic and emotional reasons. They've tried discussing using condoms or other methods, but the girlfriend isn't in favor. She argues that she's been fine in the past and doesn't like condoms, preferring the pull-out method. The author feels it's unsafe and wants to find a middle ground but is conflicted about imposing their will on their partner.\n\nNow, is the author wrong to consider reducing sex? Well, they're making a decision based on their values and safety. It's their right to set boundaries regarding their sexual health. However, communication is key. The author should make sure they've discussed this thoroughly. The girlfriend's refusal to consider other methods like the pill or female condoms might be a problem. \n\nBut the crux is whether the author is wrong. The author isn't forcing the issue; they're trying to find a solution. Since both partners have different views on contraception, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own safety. They might need to take a step back to protect themselves, especially if their partner isn't willing to compromise. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
