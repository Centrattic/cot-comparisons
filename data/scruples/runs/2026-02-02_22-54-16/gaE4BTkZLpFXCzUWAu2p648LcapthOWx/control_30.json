I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year. They're both 20, young, and living with parents, so financial stability isn't there. The guy has tried to use condoms, but the girlfriend resists. She doesn't like the feel, says she's been fine without them before, and even if they use pull-out with condoms, she thinks it's pointless. The guy feels she's being irrational and is worried about the risks. Now he's thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the main issue is about consent and mutual agreement in their sexual relationship. The girlfriend is not willing to use any protection except the pull-out method, which he argues isn't reliable. He's concerned about both unintended pregnancy and STIs. He's considering cutting back on sex to avoid the risk. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. They've had arguments before about this. The question is, is he in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex to protect himself? Legally and ethically, both partners should agree to the terms of their sexual activity. If one partner feels the other is not meeting their boundaries, it's reasonable to adjust the relationship until there's mutual agreement. \n\nHowever, there's a line between protecting oneself and being controlling. If he reduces sex without discussion, it might come off as manipulative. But since he's tried to communicate and the other party isn't budging, his actions could be seen as self-protective. The key is whether he's giving her a chance to change her mind or if he's just imposing his will. The scenario mentions he's looking for a middle ground, which suggests he's still open to compromise. \n\nAlso, considering their age and living situation, the risk of unintended pregnancy is higher for him financially. His stance is about responsibility. The girlfriend's resistance to any protection, even if she's had luck before, is risky. So, he's acting in his own interests here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. Both have different needs. The guy isn't wrong for trying to set boundaries he feels are necessary. But he should ensure that the reduction in sex is done with mutual understanding, not just unilaterally. However, since they haven't reached an agreement yet, his actions are within his rights. So, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
