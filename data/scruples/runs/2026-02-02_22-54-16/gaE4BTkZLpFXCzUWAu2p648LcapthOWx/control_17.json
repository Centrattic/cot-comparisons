I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, and they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend refuses, citing past relationships and personal preference. Now, the author feels it's unsafe and wants to set boundaries, possibly reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for taking this step. Let's consider the key points. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and is taking responsibility by wanting to use protection. The girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, and the author feels it's irrational. The author's plan is to reduce or stop sex until they can agree on a safer method.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should be on the same page regarding contraception. The author isn't forcing the issue but is trying to set boundaries for their mutual safety. The girlfriend's refusal to use any method besides pull-out could be seen as risky, especially given their age and financial situation. The author's approach is to communicate their needs and seek a compromise, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, reducing or stopping sex might be a form of withholding intimacy as a tactic, which can be problematic in relationships. But given the potential consequences of pregnancy, it's a serious matter. The author is prioritizing their well-being and future, which is valid. The girlfriend's stance might be contributing to the issue, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to address it.\n\nSo, considering the risks and the author's communication efforts, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
