I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The situation is that both are 20, living with parents, and they're using the pull-out method. The author wants protection, the girlfriend doesn't, and they've had arguments about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author has tried discussing it multiple times and there's been arguments. The girlfriend is resistant to condoms, birth control, and female condoms. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and feels it's irresponsible. The question is whether it's wrong for him to reduce sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual consent and the author's right to safety. The author isn't forcing anything; he's trying to communicate his concerns. Since they aren't on the same page about protection, continuing sex without it might be a risk he's not comfortable with. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a way to protect himself, which is his right. The girlfriend's refusal to use any method might mean the author isn't comfortable proceeding without protection, so taking a break isn't selfish but a responsible decision. \n\nBut I should check if there's a lack of negotiation. The author is trying to find a middle ground, so taking a step back until they can agree isn't wrong. It's about respecting his boundaries. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
