I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they're considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The couple has been together over a year, they're both 20 and living with their parents. The author wants to use condoms but the girlfriend doesn't, preferring the pull-out method. He's concerned about pregnancy and feels she's being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is trying to protect himself from an unwanted pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend is not willing to use any form of protection except the pull-out method, which is less effective. The author is frustrated and wants to reduce sex until they find a middle ground. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex? Well, the question is about responsibility and communication. Both partners have rights to their sexual health. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, but they haven't reached an agreement. The key here is mutual consent and compromise. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the girlfriend to stop; he's considering reducing sex. That gives them time to discuss and find a solution. The girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't like condoms and feels lucky before. But the author is concerned about the risks. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel safe and respected. The author's actions are to protect his own interests, which is understandable. However, the decision to reduce sex might be a way to push for a compromise. But is it fair? It depends on whether it's a reasonable step given the lack of agreement. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because the author is trying to address a legitimate concern and is seeking a solution. However, there's a need for mutual respect. If the author reduces sex unilaterally without discussing it fully, that could be problematic. But he's already stated he wants to find a middle ground, so maybe it's a valid approach. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's taking responsibility for his health and trying to address a serious issue. The girlfriend isn't open to other methods, so the author is within his rights to adjust their sexual activity until they can agree on a safe method. So the answer is B.\n"
