I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who have been having sex without protection except the pull-out method. The author (a guy) wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend doesn't. They've argued about it, and the guy is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. Condoms are a standard method of preventing pregnancy and STIs. The girlfriend is resistant, citing past relationships without issues and disliking the feel. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the financial/emotional readiness. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex until they agree on a safer method.\n\nThe key points: Both are 20, living with parents, not ready for kids. The author is trying to communicate his needs. The girlfriend is not open to condoms or other methods. The author is considering reducing sex to push for a safer solution. \n\nIs it wrong to reduce sex for this reason? In relationships, both partners need to agree on boundaries. If one partner is uncomfortable with the risk, it's reasonable to seek a compromise. However, using the threat of reducing sex might be seen as a form of pressure. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but the girlfriend is not budging. \n\nThe author's intention is to prioritize safety, which is responsible. However, the approach of reducing sex without a mutual agreement could be seen as a power play. It's important to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual activity. If the girlfriend is not willing to use protection, the author has a right to set boundaries to protect himself. But doing so by reducing sex might be a way to encourage discussion rather than a way to force compliance. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend is not using contraceptive methods he's suggested, which he feels is risky. The author's stance is about protecting both of them from an unintended pregnancy. The alternative methods she's not open to (pills, female condoms) are also options. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, but she's not flexible. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is trying to communicate his needs and set boundaries that are reasonable, he's not in the wrong. However, if he's using the threat of reducing sex as a manipulative tactic, that could be problematic. The question is whether his actions are a reasonable boundary or a form of coercion. \n\nSince the author is trying to find a middle ground and hasn't outright stopped sex but is considering reducing it to push for a safer method, it might be a way to encourage the girlfriend to reconsider. However, the girlfriend is also in a position where she's not budging on her end. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether setting such a boundary is acceptable. In many cases, setting boundaries around sexual activity for health and safety is not in the wrong. So the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to make sure there's no element of coercion or disrespect for her autonomy. The author is trying to negotiate, so B is likely correct.\n"
