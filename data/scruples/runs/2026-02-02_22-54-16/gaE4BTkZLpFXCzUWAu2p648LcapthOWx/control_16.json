I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The guy has tried to use condoms before, but she didn't want to. They use the pull-out method. He brings it up again, she argues against using protection, says she's been fine in the past, doesn't like condoms. He feels she's being irrational.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong if he tries to reduce sex until they find a middle ground. The possible answers are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). \n\nI need to think about consent, mutual agreement, and responsibility. In a relationship, both partners need to agree on sexual health. The guy is concerned about pregnancy and doesn't want to use a method he finds unsafe. If they can't agree, maybe reducing sex is a way to avoid pressure and ensure both are comfortable. However, could this be seen as using his needs to control the situation? \n\nBut he's not pressuring her to use a specific method; he's trying to find a middle ground. He's also considering her feelings by acknowledging condoms don't feel as good. If she's not willing to compromise, maybe reducing sex is his way to stay responsible financially and emotionally. It's about protecting both of them. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should explore other options, like non-hormonal birth control methods, but the girlfriend isn't open to that. If she's not willing to use any method he's comfortable with, then reducing sex might be a valid choice to prevent potential pregnancy. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's trying to find a solution that works, and if that means reducing sex until they can agree, that's his right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
