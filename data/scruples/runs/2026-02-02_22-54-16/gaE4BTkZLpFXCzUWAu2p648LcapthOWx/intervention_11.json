I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for Attempting...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author's main concern is about the risk of unintended pregnancy, especially since they're both 20 and not ready for children. They've tried discussing condoms and other methods, but the girlfriend is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Both partners have the right to express their boundaries and safety concerns. The girlfriend argues she's never used condoms before and hasn't gotten pregnant, and she prefers the pull-out method despite the author's push for it. The author feels it's unsafe and is worried about both economic and emotional readiness for kids. \n\nThe author is thinking about reducing sex to find a middle ground. Is this a reasonable step? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author has tried discussing it, and there's been some pushback. If they feel that their needs for contraception are not being met, and they're genuinely concerned about the risks, then prioritizing their own safety and the relationship's stability by stepping back from sex until they can agree might be a valid choice. \n\nBut I should also consider if this is an overreaction. The pull-out method isn't 100% effective, but it's a mutual decision. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being controlling or not respecting her past choices. However, the author is setting a boundary for a legitimate reason, not out of malice. They're also open to other methods like birth control or female condoms, which the girlfriend is against. So the author is trying to find a solution, but the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have a say in their sexual health. The author's action is about protecting their own interests as well as the relationship's future. If the girlfriend is unwilling to meet halfway, then the author has a right to step back and not engage in a situation that makes them uncomfortable or poses a risk they aren't willing to take. \n\nI think the key here is mutual consent and the right to set personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves; they're making a responsible choice. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
