I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she refuses to use condoms. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year. They're both 20, living with parents, and not in a place to have kids. The guy wants to use condoms, the girl doesn't. She's been in a past relationship without condoms and never pregnant. She doesn't like how they feel. They've tried discussing it, had arguments. The guy is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let me think. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and responsibility. They're both adults, and they need to agree on safe practices. The guy is concerned about pregnancy and is advocating for protection. The girl is not willing to use condoms or other methods. \n\nThe author is considering reducing sex to push for a compromise. Is that fair? Well, communication is important. They've tried discussing it, but haven't reached an agreement. The guy is trying to protect both of them, especially since they can't handle a child right now. \n\nBut reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure. Maybe the girl feels forced, but the guy is also trying to avoid an unwanted pregnancy. It's a tough spot. \n\nThe girl's stance is that she's been fine before, but that's not a guarantee. The guy is right to be cautious. However, the solution of reducing sex might not be the best approach. Open communication and maybe counseling could help. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy is trying to avoid a risky situation. The girl isn't budging. He's not wrong for wanting protection. But using a reduction in sex as a tactic could be problematic. However, given the high stakes of pregnancy, maybe his actions are justified. \n\nSo, based on the options A or B, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's acting in both their interests to prevent an unintended pregnancy, even if the method (reducing sex) is a bit of a conflict point. The core issue is the refusal to use protection despite the risks, so his concern is valid.\n"
