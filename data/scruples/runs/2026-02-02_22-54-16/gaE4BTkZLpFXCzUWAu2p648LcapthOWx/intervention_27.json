I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, not ready for kids. The author wants to use condoms, the girlfriend doesn't. They've argued before, and she's used the pull-out method, which isn't reliable. The author is frustrated because she's being inconsistent with previous relationships and not considering the risks. Now, he's thinking about cutting back on sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about unintended pregnancy, which is a valid health and financial concern. He's trying to communicate his needs and boundaries, which is responsible. On the other hand, reducing sex might affect the relationship, but it's about mutual respect and safety. The girlfriend is being resistant, not listening to his concerns, and not open to alternatives like other protection methods. The author is trying to protect both of them, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this step. Since he's trying to address a serious issue and the girlfriend isn't compromising, it's about setting boundaries. It's not about being selfish in the wrong way, but about health and responsibility. So the answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
