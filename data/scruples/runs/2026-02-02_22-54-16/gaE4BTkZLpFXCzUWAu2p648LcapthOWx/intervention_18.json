I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're not in a place financially or emotionally to have kids. They use the pull-out method, which the author has tried to change with condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't want to. She's been in a previous relationship without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she feels the pull-out is enough. The author is concerned about the risks and feels she's being irrational.\n\nThe author is now considering reducing their sex until they find a middle ground. The question is if he's in the wrong for that.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is trying to be responsible, given their age and situation. He's expressed his concerns and the girlfriend isn't budging. He's not forcing her to use something she doesn't want, but he feels uncomfortable without protection. The girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't like condoms, and she's had sex without them without issues before. She might feel pressured if he suddenly stops or reduces sex, which could affect the relationship.\n\nBut then, the author is trying to prevent a situation that could lead to unintended pregnancy. His argument is that the pull-out method isn't reliable, and he's taking it seriously. The girlfriend's argument is that she's been lucky before and doesn't like condoms. So, there's a conflict here between his risk assessment and her comfort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his boundaries. If they can't agree on protection, he might feel that continuing sex without it is a risk he can't take. However, reducing sex could be seen as a way to pressure her into changing her stance. But if he's done that after previous attempts and she's not budging, maybe he's just setting a boundary for himself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a middle ground they haven't found yet. But the author says they've tried birth control pills and female condoms, which she's against. So maybe he's at a point where he can't compromise further. \n\nI think the key here is about mutual consent and boundaries. If the author is setting a personal boundary for his own comfort and responsibility, that's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's using the reduction in sex as a form of coercion, that could be problematic. But based on the post, it seems like he's trying to find a middle ground and not being coercive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to protect himself from an unplanned pregnancy and has expressed his concerns, and if the girlfriend isn't budging, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries.\n"
