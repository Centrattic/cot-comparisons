I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together over a year, both 20, and they use the pull-out method without condoms. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but the girl refuses, saying she's never used them before, doesn't like the feeling, and thinks the pull-out is enough. They've argued a couple times. The guy is concerned about pregnancy and feels she's being irrational. He's thinking about reducing their sex life until they find a middle ground, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for that.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, mutual agreement on protection methods, and the potential consequences of not using protection. The author is trying to protect himself from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend isn't willing to use any form of protection, which he finds risky. He's considering reducing sex until they can agree on a method, which might be a way to de-escalate the conflict without forcing her.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. In a relationship, both partners should have consent and mutual agreement on such matters. If the author feels uncomfortable with the current method and the risks involved, it's his right to express that. However, if he's going to reduce or stop sex, that's a significant step that affects both partners. It's a form of withholding affection, which can be seen as a form of pressure.\n\nBut is it wrong? Well, the author is trying to find a solution that works for both. He's not just stopping without communication; he's looking for a middle ground. The girlfriend, on the other hand, isn't open to alternative methods like the pill or female condoms, which might be a deal-breaker. The author is prioritizing his own comfort and safety, which is understandable. However, if the reduction or stoppage of sex is a tactic to pressure her into changing her stance, that could be problematic. But given the context, he's trying to find a compromise, not just shut things down without discussion.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a duty to each other to ensure they're comfortable with the risks. The author is taking responsibility for his own limits, which is a mature approach. The girlfriend's stance is risky, but she's making her own choices. The author is trying to balance his needs without being controlling. So, I think he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
