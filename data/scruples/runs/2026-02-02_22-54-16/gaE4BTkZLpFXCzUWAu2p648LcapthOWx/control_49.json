I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection. The main issue is the use of the pull-out method without condoms or other contraception.\n\nFirst, the author has valid concerns about unplanned pregnancy and the financial/emotional readiness. He's tried to bring up using condoms before, but she's resistant. She argues that she's been fine in the past and doesn't like condoms. The author is now considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety? Well, in relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author is trying to protect himself from a situation he's not ready for. However, the way he's handling it could be problematic. Abruptly reducing sex without communication might hurt her feelings or be seen as a punishment. He should probably try to communicate more effectively, maybe explore other contraceptive options she's open to, or seek counseling. But is he in the wrong for having these concerns? Probably not, because he's prioritizing his own well-being. However, the method he's considering (reducing sex without discussing it thoroughly) might be where he's making a mistake. The key is whether his approach respects her autonomy and their mutual goals. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex. Since he's not forcing her and is trying to find a middle ground, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
