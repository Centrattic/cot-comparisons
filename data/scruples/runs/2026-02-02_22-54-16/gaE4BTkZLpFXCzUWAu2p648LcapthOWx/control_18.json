I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, the girlfriend refuses, saying she's never used them before and doesn't like the feeling. She argues she's lucky so far and that the pull-out is enough. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for considering this. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider consent, communication, and mutual agreement. The author is trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, which is a responsible move. However, reducing sex without mutual consent could be seen as controlling. But the girlfriend is not willing to use any protection, and the author feels it's unsafe. The key points are: both are adults, making their own choices, but the author is concerned about risks they're not willing to take. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is unwilling to compromise, the other has the right to set boundaries. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect themselves, even if it means reducing intimacy. The girlfriend's refusal is a valid choice, but the author's decision to adjust the relationship dynamics to avoid risk is also their right. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
