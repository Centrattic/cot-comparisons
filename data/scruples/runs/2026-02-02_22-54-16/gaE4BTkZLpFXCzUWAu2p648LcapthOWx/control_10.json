I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to her not using protection. The main issue is the use of condoms and the pull-out method. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are 20, living with parents, not ready for kids. The guy has tried to use condoms, but the girlfriend resists because she doesn't like how they feel and claims she's been fine in the past. She's arguing it's not necessary, but the guy is worried about the risk of pregnancy. He's thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are mutual consent, health risks, and communication. The girlfriend is refusing protection, which the guy sees as irresponsible. However, the decision to have sex without protection is mutual to some extent, as he hasn't stopped despite the arguments. The question is whether reducing sex is a valid step here.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners have the right to set boundaries. If the guy is uncomfortable with the current situation and feels it's unsafe, he's entitled to express that. However, the approach of reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure or punishment, which might not be constructive. On the other hand, if he's genuinely concerned about his future and the risks, it's his right to prioritize his well-being.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's trying to find a solution through communication, then maybe not. However, reducing sex unilaterally without resolving the issue might not be fair, especially if it's a sudden change. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's been using pull-out before, and the guy is now pushing for condoms. There's a conflict in priorities here. The ethical standpoint would consider both sides: the guy's economic and emotional readiness, and the girl's comfort and past experiences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong (answer A) or not (B), I need to decide. The guy is trying to protect himself from a situation he's not ready for. While he could be more proactive in finding a solution, like exploring other contraceptive methods together, reducing sex might not be the best approach. However, he's not entirely wrong because he's asserting his boundaries. But maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because he's making a responsible choice based on his needs. Alternatively, A might be if reducing sex is seen as a selfish move. Hmm, this is tricky. I think it's more about whether his actions are justified. Since he's trying to communicate and find a middle ground, and the problem stems from her refusal to use protection despite his concerns, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
