I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person from the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because they want to use protection. The girlfriend is against using condoms or other methods, relying on the pull-out method and her past experience. The author feels she's being irrational but doesn't want to be selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man wants to prevent pregnancy and feels the current method isn't safe. The woman is resistant to using condoms, which are a common form of protection. The key issue here is consent and mutual agreement on contraceptive methods. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on how to prevent pregnancy or STIs. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other isn't budging, the person advocating for safety isn't wrong. The man is trying to protect both himself and his partner, which is responsible. The woman's past experience doesn't guarantee future results, and relying solely on pull-out has a higher failure rate. \n\nReducing or stopping sex until they reach a compromise could be a reasonable step if communication isn't working. It's about setting boundaries for his own peace of mind and safety. However, it's important that he's not using this as a way to control the situation without dialogue. Since he's trying to find a middle ground, his actions might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if he stops sex abruptly without discussion, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But the scenario says he's trying to find a middle ground, so his intention is to reach a mutual agreement. Therefore, he isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize safety and for seeking a solution that both can agree on.\n"
