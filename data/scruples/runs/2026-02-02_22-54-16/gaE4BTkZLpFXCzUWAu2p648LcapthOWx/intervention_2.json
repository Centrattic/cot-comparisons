I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The main issue is about unprotected sex and differing opinions on contraception.\n\nThe author and girlfriend have been together over a year. They don't use condoms, just the pull-out method. The author wants protection because they're young and can't handle kids financially or emotionally. The girlfriend disagrees, says she's been fine before, doesn't like condoms, and thinks pull-out is enough. They've had arguments about it.\n\nThe author is thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground. They feel it's selfish to impose but also want to be responsible. The user thinks the author is right but wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are consent, shared responsibility, and health. The author is trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy. The girlfriend isn't willing to use any method she's comfortable with. The author is not forcing her but considering reducing intimacy to avoid risk. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're advocating for safety. The girlfriend is in a position where she's not using any method, which is her choice, but the author is concerned. The author isn't pressuring her to use something she's against, but wants a compromise. If they can't agree, reducing sex to avoid risk isn't wrong. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
