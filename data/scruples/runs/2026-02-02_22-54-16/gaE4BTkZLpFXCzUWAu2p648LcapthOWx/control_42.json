I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she won't use protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're not using any protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms because they can't handle kids right now. The girl refuses, saying she's never used condoms before, doesn't like how they feel, and claims she's been lucky so far. She also argues that condoms can break, but the guy points out that without condoms, the risk is higher. They've discussed other methods like the pill or female condoms, but she's not interested.\n\nThe author is conflicted: he feels it's unsafe but doesn't want to be selfish by cutting down on sex. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. In relationships, communication is key. The guy has tried multiple times to discuss safe sex, and the girl is resistant. He's concerned about an unplanned pregnancy, which is a valid risk. The girl's stance seems to ignore the potential risks, relying on past luck and the pull-out method, which isn't very effective. The guy is trying to protect both of them, not just himself. \n\nBut is it his place to reduce sex? Well, consent and mutual agreement are important. If they can't agree on protection, then having sex without it might be a risk he's not comfortable taking. However, reducing or stopping sex is a significant step. He needs to consider if this is a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIn ethical terms, the guy isn't wrong for prioritizing his own and their shared future. He's not being coercive; he's setting boundaries based on his values. The girl's refusal to use protection despite discussions might indicate she's not prioritizing his concerns. So, if he's unwilling to take the risk, it's reasonable for him to take steps to protect himself, even if it affects their sexual activity. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Could they explore other birth control methods together? The girl is resistant to pills and female condoms. Maybe more discussion is needed. However, the author has tried that. If he can't convince her, then his decision to reduce sex to avoid compromising his values isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking responsible steps to protect himself and the relationship from potential future issues.\n"
