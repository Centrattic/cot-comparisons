I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been together over a year. They've been having sex without protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on using condoms because they're both young (20), living with their parents, and not ready for kids economically or emotionally. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, says she's never used them in her past relationship and hasn't gotten pregnant. She argues the pull-out is enough and doesn't like the feel of condoms. The author thinks she's being irrational and is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not wrong (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's concern is valid because not using protection does carry risks, especially pregnancy and STIs. The girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't want to use condoms, perhaps due to personal preference or past experiences. She also mentions she's been lucky so far, but luck can change. The author is trying to protect both of them but is facing resistance.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about reducing the frequency of sex until they can agree. Is that a selfish move? On one hand, he's prioritizing safety, which is responsible. On the other hand, maybe he's imposing his will on her, which could be seen as controlling. But given the potential consequences of pregnancy, which could severely impact their lives, his concern is justified. The girlfriend is not willing to consider alternatives like birth control or female condoms, which might be a problem. \n\nAnother angle: communication. They've had arguments about this. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is good. The girlfriend is not budging. Is it fair for the author to ask for a compromise? Maybe. If they can't agree, then maybe the author is within his rights to set boundaries to protect himself. Reducing sex might be a way to encourage her to reconsider or find a solution they can agree on.\n\nBut is reducing sex the right approach? It might lead to resentment. Alternatively, maybe the author should seek a professional's advice or set firm boundaries without reducing intimacy in a way that's harmful. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to prevent something that could have serious consequences, then maybe he's not wrong. The girlfriend's stance puts both at risk, so the author's actions could be seen as responsible.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not wrong) because he's acting in their best interest to prevent an unintended pregnancy, which is a major issue. The girlfriend is not willing to take necessary precautions, so the author's desire for a safer approach is understandable and responsible.\n"
