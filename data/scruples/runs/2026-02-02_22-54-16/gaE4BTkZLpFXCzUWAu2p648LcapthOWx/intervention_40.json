I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they can't agree on using protection. The situation is that they're both 20, living with parents, and don't want kids now. The girlfriend doesn't like condoms, has used the pull-out method before, and refuses other forms of birth control. The author is conflicted between their safety concerns and not wanting to impose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about unprotected sex leading to unintended pregnancy, which is a valid health and financial risk. The girlfriend is resistant to using condoms or other methods, citing past experiences and personal preference. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to protect themselves from a situation that could have serious consequences. The girlfriend's stance is risky, and the author has a right to feel uneasy. However, the author is thinking about reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of pressure or manipulation if not communicated properly. But given their reasons are about safety, maybe it's justified. They're seeking a compromise, not cutting things off completely. It's a difficult balance. The question is whether imposing their safety measures is selfish. Since they've discussed it before and she's being resistant, the author has a valid concern. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
