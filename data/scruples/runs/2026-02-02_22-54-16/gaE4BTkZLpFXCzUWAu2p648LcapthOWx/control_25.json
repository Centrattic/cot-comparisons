I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together over a year. They're both 20, living with their parents, and not ready for kids. The guy wants to use condoms, but she insists on the pull-out method. He's tried to reason with her, but she's resistant, saying she's been fine with pull-out before and doesn't like the feel of condoms. They've discussed other options like the pill or female condoms, but she's against those too. Now, the guy is considering reducing their sex until they find a middle ground and is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. He's concerned about unintended pregnancy and the financial/emotional readiness. That's a valid concern. She's not using any protection except pull-out, which he knows isn't reliable. He's trying to compromise by suggesting condoms, which she resists. He's not forcing her but is pushing for safety. \n\nIs he being selfish? He's trying to protect both of them from an unplanned pregnancy. His argument is that it's a compromise for safety. She's dismissing his concerns, relying on luck. From a health and safety standpoint, using protection is responsible. The pull-out method has a high failure rate compared to condoms. So, his stance is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for reducing sex. If communication isn't working and he's not comfortable with the risk, then setting boundaries makes sense. But is it wrong to reduce intimacy? It depends on mutual consent and communication. He's tried discussing it, and she's not budging. If he's uncomfortable continuing without protection, then adjusting the frequency of sex is a personal choice. He's not forcing her; he's adjusting his behavior based on his comfort level.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's preferences matter too. If she's unwilling to compromise, he might feel that respecting her choice means accepting the risk. But he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being. The key here is whether he's acting unilaterally without considering her feelings. He has discussed it, and she's resistant. So, his decision to reduce sex could be seen as a last resort after trying to communicate.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, both parties have the right to set boundaries. The author isn't being coercive; he's trying to negotiate a solution. Since she's not open to any form of protection, he might not have a middle ground to reach. Therefore, his decision to reduce sex isn't necessarily wrong because he's prioritizing his own safety and the relationship's future. \n\nHowever, another angle is that reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure, but given the context, it's more about self-responsibility. The answer here would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a responsible choice after failed communication attempts. He's not imposing but adjusting to his comfort level regarding the risk of pregnancy.\n"
