I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she doesn't use protection. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, and they don't use condoms except the pull-out method. The guy wants protection because he's not ready for kids financially or emotionally. The girlfriend doesn't want to use them, citing past relationships and preference. They've argued about it, and he's feeling conflicted about imposing his will on their sex life.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The guy's perspective is about responsibility and safety. He's trying to avoid an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's stance is about personal preference and past experiences. She's not using protection and feels the pull-out method is sufficient, even though it's less effective than condoms. \n\nNow, the ethical angle: Is it fair for him to reduce sex to enforce his boundaries? Communication is key in relationships. He's tried discussing it and there's been arguments. If she's not willing to compromise, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary to protect himself. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of punishment or withholding intimacy, which might be unhealthy. \n\nBut the alternative is accepting the risk of pregnancy without being on the same page. If he's uncomfortable with the risk, then finding a middle ground is necessary. The article mentions birth control and female condoms, but she's against those too. So maybe there's no middle ground. \n\nIs he selfish for wanting protection? Arguably not, since he's being responsible. But is he in the wrong for reducing sex? It depends on how he approaches it. If he's communicating his needs and trying to find a solution, maybe not. However, if he unilaterally stops without discussing, that could be problematic. The article says he's considering doing so until a middle ground is found, which suggests he's still trying to negotiate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both are at fault. The girlfriend isn't taking his concerns seriously, and the guy is trying to protect himself. So, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his well-being and seeking a compromise.\n"
