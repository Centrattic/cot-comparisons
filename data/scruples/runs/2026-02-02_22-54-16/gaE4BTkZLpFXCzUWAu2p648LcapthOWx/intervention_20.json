I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection except the pull-out method, and the author wants to reduce or stop having sex until they can find a middle ground. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or birth control and feels it's unnecessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is concerned about the risk of unintended pregnancy and the financial and emotional readiness. He's tried to communicate his concerns, but the girlfriend isn't budging. Now he's considering reducing sex to push for a compromise.\n\nIs it the author's place to impose his preferences? In a relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their bodies and choices. However, the author is also responsible for his own well-being and future. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's trying to set boundaries for himself. Communication is key here. The author has discussed the issue before, but they haven't found a solution. Maybe reducing or stopping sex is a way to signal his non-negotiable boundaries. But is that fair? It could be seen as a form of pressure, even if passive, to make her comply. Alternatively, it's his right to prioritize his own comfort and safety. \n\nThe key factors are mutual respect and consent. The author isn't forcing her to use protection; he's choosing to adjust his behavior to align with his values. However, if the reduction in sex is a punishment or ultimatum without agreement, that could be problematic. But given the context, he's trying to find a middle ground, not just stop entirely without discussion. \n\nI think the author is in the right because he's making a choice that protects his interests while trying to be reasonable. But there's a nuance here. If he's not communicating clearly or considering her feelings, that's an issue. However, the scenario shows he's tried to discuss it, so maybe it's justified. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
