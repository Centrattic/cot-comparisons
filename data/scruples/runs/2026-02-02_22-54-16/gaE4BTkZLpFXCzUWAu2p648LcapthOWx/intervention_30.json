I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who are in a year-long relationship, having sex without protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms because they're young, not ready for kids, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she's had unprotected sex before without getting pregnant and doesn't like condoms. He's considering reducing sex unless they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects. The man is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and wants to use protection. The woman isn't using contraception other than the pull-out method, which isn't as effective. The man's position is about responsibility and safety. He's trying to communicate his needs, which is important in a relationship. The woman's resistance might be based on past experiences and personal preference, but she might be underestimating the risks.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex. The key points are consent, mutual agreement, and health. The author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, the woman might feel that her needs and comfort are being prioritized over hers. In healthy relationships, both partners' needs should be considered, but when there's a significant risk involved, especially to one's health or future, the person advocating for safety isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nThe author hasn't forced the issue yet but is contemplating reducing sex to find a middle ground. This could be seen as a reasonable step to avoid a potential crisis. However, communication is crucial. If he communicates his concerns clearly and respectfully, trying to find a compromise, he's acting responsibly. The woman might feel pressured, but the author's intention is to protect both of them.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is imposing his will on the relationship, which could be seen as controlling. But since they're in a committed relationship, discussing and agreeing on contraception is part of mutual responsibility. The woman's autonomy is important, but so is the man's right to feel safe. The author might be in the right for trying to ensure both parties are protected.\n\nAnother angle: The woman's refusal to use any contraception except pull-out could be risky. The man's decision to reduce sex until they find a solution might be necessary for his peace of mind and to prevent potential unwanted pregnancy. It's a difficult situation, but the author's actions are aimed at preventing a negative outcome, so he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
