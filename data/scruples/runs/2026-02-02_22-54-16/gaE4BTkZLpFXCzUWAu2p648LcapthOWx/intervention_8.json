I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Arguing That...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they're not using protection except the pull-out method, and the girlfriend isn't willing to use condoms or other birth control.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risk involved. They've tried discussing it before, and the girlfriend is resistant, arguing that she's been fine in the past and doesn't like condoms. She's not willing to take other birth control methods either.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because they don't want to impose, but they think it's the responsible choice. Now they're considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to verify.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to protect both of them from a situation they're not ready for. The girlfriend is being dismissive of the risks, relying on past luck. The author's approach of reducing sex could be seen as a way to prioritize their own and the relationship's well-being. However, communication is key in relationships. The author is making their concerns known and seeking a compromise. They haven't forced anything, just considering adjusting their behavior to align with their boundaries. That seems reasonable. The girlfriend's resistance might be seen as not taking the partner's concerns seriously enough. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
