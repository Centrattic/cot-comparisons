I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author is 20, in a one-year relationship, and the girlfriend refuses condoms, birth control, and female condoms, citing past relationships and preference for the pull-out method. The author feels it's irresponsible but also doesn't want to be selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions would be justified. The main issue here is the use of protection. The girlfriend isn't using any method that the author is comfortable with, and the author is concerned about unintended pregnancy. The pull-out method isn't reliable, so the author is trying to find a compromise, which the girlfriend isn't accepting. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to consider reducing sex to find a middle ground. In relationships, communication is key. The author has already tried to discuss it and face resistance. If both partners can't agree on a method, it's a valid concern. The author has the right to set boundaries for their own comfort and safety. However, suddenly reducing sex might be seen as a punishment or a lack of compromise. But the author is trying to find a middle ground, not cutting it off entirely. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is also important. If she's not open to any alternative methods, she's not taking the author's concerns seriously. The author is trying to prioritize their future, which is responsible. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves, but the approach might need to be more collaborative. Still, the core issue is the lack of mutual agreement on protection, which is a significant factor. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is acting in their own best interest and has communicated their concerns. However, it's important that they do this in a way that's respectful and continues to work on finding a solution with their partner.\n"
