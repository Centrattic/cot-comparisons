I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author and his girlfriend, both 20 years old, have been having unprotected sex using the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms or other protection because they can't afford or handle having a child right now. The girlfriend refuses, saying she's been fine without them in the past and doesn't like condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about responsibility and the risks of not using protection. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that the pull-out method is sufficient and that condoms aren't necessary. She's also not interested in other forms of birth control like the pill or female condoms. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if he decides to reduce or stop sex until they find a middle ground. Let's think about consent and mutual agreement. In a healthy relationship, both partners need to agree on contraception. The author is trying to express his concerns, but the girlfriend isn't budging. If he reduces sex because he's uncomfortable with the current method, is that selfish?\n\nThe author might feel that he's protecting both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, completely stopping or reducing sex without a mutual agreement could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy, which might not be healthy. The key here is whether communication has been sufficient. They've had arguments before, so maybe they haven't found a compromise yet. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasoning is that she's been fine without condoms before and doesn't like them. But the author is right to point out that she might have been lucky. The pull-out method isn't reliable. However, the girlfriend's feelings about condoms are genuine. If the author is willing to try condoms again and she's still against them, maybe they need to explore other options, but she's not open to other methods either.\n\nIf the author tries to reduce sex to pressure her into using protection, is that fair? It could be seen as using his needs to control the relationship dynamics. But if he's honest about his concerns and they can't find a middle ground, maybe it's reasonable to take a step back to avoid potential harm. However, completely stopping sex without a discussion might not be the best approach. They need to find a way to address the issue without using sex as leverage. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners share the responsibility of contraception. The author is trying to uphold that, but the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise. The author's actions might be a last resort to protect himself, but it's important that they communicate openly and seek a solution together, perhaps involving medical advice or counseling. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's reducing sex to avoid potential pregnancy, he's acting out of self-preservation, which is understandable. But if it's done without considering the girlfriend's feelings and without seeking a collaborative solution, it could be seen as selfish. However, given the risks involved, his stance might be justified. The key point is whether there's a mutual understanding or if he's imposing his will unilaterally. Since they haven't reached an agreement, maybe he's in the right to take a step back to protect himself, but ideally, they should work it out together.\n"
