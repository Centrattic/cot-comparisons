I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 and living with parents. The author wants protection because they're not ready for kids financially or emotionally. The girlfriend refuses, using the pull-out method, and doesn't like condoms. She argues that she's never used them before, hasn't gotten pregnant, and that the chance of condom breakage is low. The author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted about imposing their view, hence the question about whether reducing sex would be wrong.\n\nSo, the core issue is about conflicting values regarding contraception. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy, which is a valid and responsible stance, especially given their age and living situation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is prioritizing her comfort and past experiences, which may not account for the statistical risk. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual agreement on such matters are crucial. The author has tried discussing it, but there's no resolution. The dilemma is whether the author is justified in limiting intimacy to protect against a potential risk they can't agree on. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, not using any protection except pull-out increases the risk of pregnancy. The author's desire to use condoms is a preventive measure. The girlfriend's argument is based on personal preference and past luck, which isn't a solid basis for future safety. \n\nHowever, the author is considering reducing sex unilaterally. That could be seen as a form of withdrawal of intimacy, which might be a valid strategy if all communication attempts have failed and the issue is a deal-breaker. But it's important to assess if the author has exhausted all possible communication methods and alternatives, like exploring other contraceptive options the girlfriend is open to. \n\nThe author mentions birth control pills and female condoms, but the girlfriend isn't up for those either. So, there's a lack of agreement. If the author feels it's a matter of safety and well-being, reducing sex might be a way to enforce mutual respect for boundaries. But is it selfish? Or is it responsible? The author's fear of being selfish vs. being responsible is key here. \n\nLegally and ethically, both partners should consent to the terms of their sexual relationship. If the author is uncomfortable with the current method and can't persuade the girlfriend to use any protection, they have the right to set boundaries. However, completely stopping sex might be harsh without further discussion. Maybe the author should consider other options first, but if they've already tried and there's no agreement, then reducing sex could be a way to prioritize their own values and safety. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their own safety and trying to find a compromise. But it's a balancing act between respect and responsibility. Since the situation is unresolved and the author is making a reasonable effort to communicate, their choice to reduce sex isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
