I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. The situation is that both are 20, not ready for kids, and there's disagreement on using condoms. The girlfriend has past experience without them and feels the pull-out method is enough. The author is conflicted between his responsibility and not wanting to be selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent, shared responsibility, and communication. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, and the author is concerned about the risks. They've discussed birth control and female condoms, but she's not interested. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual agreement on such matters. If one partner is insistent on protection and the other isn't, it's a valid concern. However, the author is contemplating withholding sex if they can't reach an agreement. That raises questions about whether it's his right to do so. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is based on past experience and preference, while the author is focused on risk. They both have valid points but from different perspectives. The author's intent is to avoid an unintended pregnancy, which is responsible. But reducing or stopping sex unilaterally might be seen as a conflict in the relationship dynamics. \n\nIt's important to consider if there's a way to compromise. The author suggests using condoms despite her discomfort, but she resists. Maybe exploring other contraceptive methods they both agree on could help. However, given the information, the author feels stuck. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he takes a stand for his values, that's his right, but he must also respect her autonomy. However, if he unilaterally decides to reduce sex without mutual agreement, could that be seen as controlling? Alternatively, if he's trying to protect both from a risky situation, maybe he's justified. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's autonomy versus his own responsibility. Since both partners need to consent to the terms of their sexual activity, the author might not be wrong in seeking to protect himself, but he should communicate better and seek a compromise that both agree on. However, reducing sex without agreement might not be the best approach. But given the context, maybe he's not wrong because he's prioritizing safety.\n"
