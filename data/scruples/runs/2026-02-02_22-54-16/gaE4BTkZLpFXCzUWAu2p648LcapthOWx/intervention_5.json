I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, use the pull-out method, and he wants to use condoms. She's resistant, saying she's never used them before, doesn't like the feel, and claims she's been lucky. The author is conflicted but wants to prioritize safety.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspect here. The key points are consent, mutual agreement, and health. Using the pull-out method isn't very effective, and he's concerned about unintended pregnancy. She's not willing to use any protection, which he sees as risky. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to protect himself and his future, which is responsible. But he's also considering imposing his preference, which could be a point of contention. However, if he's not comfortable with the current arrangement, it's okay to set boundaries. The question is about whether it's wrong to reduce sex to avoid risk. Since both need to agree on the terms of their sexual relationship, his approach might be justified. He's not forcing her but adjusting his behavior to align with his comfort level. So, answer B (No) makes sense because he's acting in his own responsible interest and seeking a compromise without coercion.\n"
