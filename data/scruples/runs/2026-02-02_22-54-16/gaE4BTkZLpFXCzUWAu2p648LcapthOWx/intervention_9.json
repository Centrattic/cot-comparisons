I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection beyond the pull-out method. The girlfriend has a history of not using condoms in previous relationships and is against using them now, citing how they feel. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and the responsibility, especially since they're both 20 and not ready for kids. They tried discussing it, but there's no agreement, so now they're considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The author is trying to communicate their boundaries and concerns. It's important in a relationship for both partners to respect each other's needs and values. The girlfriend is being resistant to using protection, which the author sees as necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their well-being. But is it fair to reduce intimacy as a result?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to express their needs and make decisions based on their comfort with the risk. If they feel the current situation is unsafe and they can't compromise, then taking a step back from sex might be a way to prioritize their own values and future. It's not about being selfish, but ensuring they're both on the same page regarding safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is rejecting her or the relationship because of her preferences. However, her argument is based on past luck and personal discomfort, which the author rightly points out might not be reliable. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, which is reasonable. Since the girlfriend is against all forms of protection, the author's action to reduce sex could be a way to enforce their boundaries without being coercive. \n\nI should also think about consent and mutual agreement. Both partners need to consent to the terms of their sexual activity. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current setup, they have the right to voice that. The author isn't forcing the issue but is trying to find a middle ground, which shows they're trying to be respectful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex to address their concerns. They're acting in their own best interest and the relationship's best interest by pushing for safer practices. The answer should be B.\n"
