I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms anymore, even though the author has concerns about pregnancy and responsibility. They've discussed alternatives like the pill or female condoms, but she's against those too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author wants to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, which is understandable, especially since they're both young and not in a position to handle parenthood. The girlfriend seems to be relying on the pull-out method, which is known to be less effective than condoms. Her argument is that she's been with others before without issues and likes the feel without protection. But the author feels it's irresponsible and wants to use condoms, even if she finds them less pleasurable.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex until they find a middle ground. The user is asking for a judgment based on the situation. From a relationship ethics standpoint, communication and mutual consent are crucial. The author has already tried to discuss it multiple times, and the girlfriend is not willing to compromise. The author is prioritizing their own and their partner's well-being by avoiding potential pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, making a decision to reduce sex without agreement could be seen as imposing their will, which might be selfish or controlling. But if the girlfriend is unwilling to budge, and the author is trying to protect both of them, maybe it's a justified stance.\n\nBut here's the thing: both parties need to be on the same page regarding contraception. If the girlfriend is not open to any method the author prefers, the author has a right to express their boundaries. However, the author should ensure that their actions are not being coercive. Maybe suggesting alternatives, like a different birth control method she might be open to, could be a middle ground. If she's resistant to all forms of protection, the author might have a valid reason to reconsider the physical intimacy they engage in. That said, completely stopping or reducing sex without her consent could affect the relationship negatively. It's a balance between personal responsibility and respecting the partner's autonomy. I think the author is not in the wrong because they're standing up for their values and safety, but they should approach it with empathy, not just abruptly. So the answer might be B, but I need to check if there's a wrong angle. The girlfriend's argument is based on past experience and preference, but that doesn't negate the author's valid concerns. The author's intention is to protect both, so it's not about being in the wrong, but about differing priorities. Therefore, B is the answer.\n"
