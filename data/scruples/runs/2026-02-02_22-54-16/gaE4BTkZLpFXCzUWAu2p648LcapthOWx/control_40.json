I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong if they decide to reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because they want to use protection and she doesn't. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend have been together over a year. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't want to. They had arguments, and now the author is reconsidering because they see it as irresponsible. The girlfriend's arguments are that she's never used condoms in the past, hasn't gotten pregnant, she doesn't like how they feel, and she thinks the pull-out method is enough. The author is conflicted between imposing their preference and feeling it's the right thing to do. They're considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and mutual agreement on contraceptive use. Both partners should agree on how to prevent pregnancy and STIs. The author is concerned about not wanting children yet and the risks involved. The girlfriend is against using any protection, which is her right, but the author feels it's irresponsible. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong if they reduce or stop sex? Well, if the author is trying to influence the situation without finding a compromise, maybe. But the author is trying to communicate their concerns. The problem is that the girlfriend isn't willing to use any form of protection, including birth control or female condoms. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. \n\nBut is that fair? If the author is uncomfortable with the current arrangement, it's their right to set boundaries. However, the author needs to consider that the decision to have sex involves both partners' consent. If one partner is uncomfortable with the method, they can choose to not engage in sex. However, the author should be mindful of not pressuring the other or making unilateral decisions. \n\nBut in this case, the author is considering reducing sex until they reach a middle ground, which is a way to express their concerns. The girlfriend isn't budging, and the author is trying to prioritize their own values. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not, because they're acting on their own boundaries. However, if the author were to completely stop sex without trying to communicate further, that could be seen as abrupt. But the question is about reducing or stopping until a middle ground is found. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is taking responsibility for their own comfort and health, and trying to find a solution. The girlfriend is not willing to compromise, so the author has the right to set boundaries. However, there's a need for mutual respect, and the author should not force their will. But since they're trying to find a middle ground, it's reasonable.\n"
