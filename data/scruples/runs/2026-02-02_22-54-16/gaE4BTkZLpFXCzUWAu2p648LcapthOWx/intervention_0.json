I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with the girlfriend because they're not using protection. The main issue is the use of the pull-out method without other forms of contraception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has brought up using condoms and other methods, but the girlfriend is resistant. She's had luck before, doesn't like condom feel, and argues that the pull-out is enough. The author feels she's being irrational, but maybe he's overstepping by possibly reducing sex as a consequence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, he's trying to protect them both from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, using sex as a lever in the relationship could be seen as manipulative or withholding intimacy, which might be considered wrong. But the author hasn't acted yet, just considering it. Also, communication is key here. They've had arguments, so maybe there's a lack of effective communication.\n\nI need to check if reducing sex is a reasonable step. The author is trying to find a middle ground, which suggests he's being responsible. However, if he stops or reduces sex unilaterally without mutual agreement, it might be seen as controlling. But since they're both young and not in a position for kids, the author's stance is about safety. However, the girlfriend's right to bodily autonomy and preferences also matter. There's a balance between personal responsibility and respecting partner's choices.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to avoid pregnancy. But using sex as a punishment or leverage might be problematic. However, he's not acting yet, just considering it. The question is whether the thought of doing so makes him wrong. Since he's trying to find a middle ground, perhaps he's not wrong. The answer might be B (No). But need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe he should seek counseling or find alternative solutions instead of reducing sex. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best solution. So, the answer is B.\n"
