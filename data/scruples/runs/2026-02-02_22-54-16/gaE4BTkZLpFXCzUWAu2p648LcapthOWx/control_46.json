I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend due to unsafe sex practices. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're using the pull-out method without condoms. The author has tried to introduce condoms before but faced resistance. The girlfriend argues she's never used condoms in the past, hasn't gotten pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. She also points out that condoms can break, and she's against other forms of birth control like the pill or female condoms.\n\nThe author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted about imposing his preferences. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The key here is whether his actions are wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. The author has tried discussing the issue multiple times, so he's not ignoring the problem. He's concerned about their economic and emotional readiness for children, which is valid. The girlfriend's resistance might stem from personal preference or past experiences. However, her argument relies on past luck and convenience, which isn't reliable for preventing pregnancy.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong to reduce intimacy. If he's honest and communicates his reasons, it's not necessarily wrong to set boundaries for his comfort. However, making unilateral decisions without mutual agreement could strain the relationship. The right approach would involve continued dialogue and exploring all options together. Since the author is seeking a middle ground rather than forcing his will, he's acting responsibly. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but only if he's handling it respectfully and collaboratively.\n"
