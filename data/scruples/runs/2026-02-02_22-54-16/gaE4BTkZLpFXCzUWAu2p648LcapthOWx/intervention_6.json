I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to her not using protection.\n\nFirst, the context: They're both 20, in a year-long relationship, not using condoms except the pull-out method. The guy wants protection for economic and emotional reasons. The girl argues that she's never used condoms before, doesn't like how they feel, and relies on luck. She's resistant to other methods like birth control or female condoms. The author is conflicted between imposing his preference and feeling it's the responsible choice.\n\nNow, the key points. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, which is good. He's trying to find a middle ground, even suggesting condoms if she's uncomfortable but willing to compromise. She's not open to alternatives. The question is whether reducing sex to find a middle ground is wrong.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, he's prioritizing avoiding unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. He's not forcing her but trying to set boundaries for mutual safety. She's being dismissive of his valid points (condoms reduce risk, relying on luck isn't safe). If he reduces sex to protect both, is that selfish? Or is he just setting a boundary for his own comfort and safety?\n\nEthically, it's about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. He's not pushing for unprotected sex; he's trying to get her to agree on a method. If she won't budge, he's within his right to adjust his behavior to align with his own risk tolerance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
