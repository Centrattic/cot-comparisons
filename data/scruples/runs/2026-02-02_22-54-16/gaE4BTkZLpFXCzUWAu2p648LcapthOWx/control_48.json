I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to her not using protection.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the use of protection. The girlfriend doesn't use condoms or other methods, relying on the pull-out method. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the economic/emotional readiness. The girlfriend argues she's been fine in the past and doesn't like condoms.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual agreement in relationships. Both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activities. The author is trying to protect himself from a situation he's not ready for. However, reducing or stopping sex without mutual agreement might be seen as a form of coercion or pressure. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she's made this choice before and is comfortable with it. The author feels she's being irrational, but her reasons (past experience, preference) are valid from her perspective. The key here is communication and compromise. The author has tried discussing alternatives like female condoms or birth control, but she's not open to them. \n\nIs the author wrong to want to reduce sex until a middle ground is found? It's a tough spot. On one hand, he's prioritizing his own boundaries and safety. On the other, the decision to have sex should be mutual. If he's not comfortable with the current setup, he has the right to express that. However, using the threat of withholding sex to enforce his preference might not be fair unless they can find a compromise. \n\nBut in the scenario, he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground, which shows he's trying to find a solution. The question is whether this action is wrong. Since he's communicating his concerns and seeking a compromise, it's more about the method. If he's not pressuring her but setting boundaries for himself, then he's not in the wrong. However, if it's a manipulative tactic, that's different. The post suggests he's trying to find a solution, so likely answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
