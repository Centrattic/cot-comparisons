I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. The couple hasn't used condoms except for the pull-out method. The guy has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't agree, leading to arguments. She says she's never used condoms in past relationships and never got pregnant, so she thinks pull-out is enough. She dislikes the feel of condoms. The guy brings up the risk and suggests compromise, but she resists, even saying there's no point in using them if they might break. Now he's thinking about reducing sex until he finds a middle ground.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, the key points here are consent, shared responsibility, and health risks. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and wants protection. His girlfriend is against using any method except the pull-out. He's feeling conflicted between his desire to be responsible and his fear of being selfish by cutting back on sex. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to sexual health and contraception, both partners should agree on the method. The fact that she's resistant to all forms of protection (condoms, pills, female condoms) and he's not comfortable with the current method without backup is a problem. He's trying to communicate his concerns, which is good. But if she's not willing to budge, he has to consider his own boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to reduce sex to find a compromise? Well, if they're both okay with the current method, maybe not. But the author feels it's unsafe. If he's not comfortable with the risk, then setting boundaries is reasonable. However, the pull-out method is known to be less effective than other methods. So, the girlfriend's approach is risky, and the author is trying to protect both of them. \n\nHe's not being selfish if he's considering their future and the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy. But he needs to approach this in a way that's respectful. Reducing sex might be a way to get her to reconsider, or maybe to find a mutually agreeable solution. However, it's also possible that he's pressuring her by implying he might reduce intimacy if she doesn't comply, which could be seen as a form of manipulation. \n\nBut given that he's already tried discussing it and she's not willing to change, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary. The alternative is to continue without protection, which he's not comfortable with. So, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
