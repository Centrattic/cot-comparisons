I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection beyond the pull-out method. Both are 20, living with parents, not ready for kids.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend seems to be against using condoms, citing past relationships and personal preference (not liking how they feel). The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy, especially since they're not financially or emotionally ready. They've had arguments about this, and he's feeling she's being irrational.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author is trying to express his concerns and wants to protect both of them. He's even suggested alternatives like condoms or birth control, but she's not open to them. \n\nNow, the question is whether reducing sex is the right move. It's important to consider if this decision is communicated respectfully. The author isn't forcing her; he's trying to find a middle ground. If he's clear and compassionate, he's not wrong for prioritizing safety. However, if he stops communication or makes unilateral decisions without discussion, that could be an issue. But based on the scenario, he seems to be seeking a solution, not just cutting things off abruptly. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. If one partner's needs aren't being met, it's reasonable to adjust the relationship dynamics until a solution is found. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect both of them. Answer B.\n"
