I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the condom issue. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over a year, both 20, no protection except pull-out. The guy wants condoms because they can't handle kids right now. The girl refuses, says she's never used them before and feels the pull-out is enough. He's worried about her being lucky, she's not interested in other methods like birth control or female condoms. Now he's thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to stop sex to enforce safer practices. Let's consider consent and communication. Both partners need to agree on sexual boundaries. The guy is trying to protect himself from an unplanned pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, the girl isn't on board, and he's not forcing her but considering reducing intimacy to push for his terms. \n\nIs it his right to do that? Well, if consent requires mutual agreement, then if she's not willing to use protection and he's not comfortable without it, the decision to reduce sex could be his way of setting a boundary. But does that make him in the wrong? Or is it about respecting each other's boundaries? If he's not pressuring her into unsafe sex, but is choosing to decrease intimacy to protect himself, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the girl's choice to not use condoms might be her personal decision, but he has the right to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety. However, reducing sex might be a form of coercion unless they can communicate and find a solution together. But the user isn't forcing her; he's considering reducing it to find a middle ground. So maybe it's a reasonable approach. \n\nThe key is whether both are respecting each other's limits. If he's not pressuring her into unsafe sex, but is adjusting his intimacy to align with his safety needs, then he's not wrong. The girl's stance is risky, but he's taking steps to protect himself without coercion. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
