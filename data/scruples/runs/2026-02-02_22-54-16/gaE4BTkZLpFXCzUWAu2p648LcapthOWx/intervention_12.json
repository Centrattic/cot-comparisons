I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in relationships.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year. The author has tried to use condoms but the girlfriend refused, preferring the pull-out method. They've had arguments about this. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and feels the current method is unsafe. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels it's sufficient and doesn't like condoms. \n\nNow, the author is thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether this is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on safety measures. The author is taking responsibility for their own comfort and safety. The girlfriend isn't willing to use protection, which the author finds risky. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, showing they're considering both their needs and theirs. \n\nReducing sex could be a way to avoid pressure and find a compromise. But is it wrong? Well, the author isn't forcing the issue but is trying to address their own boundaries. The girlfriend isn't budging, so the author is left with difficult choices. \n\nHowever, reducing sex without discussing it might not be the best approach. Open communication is key. The author should talk to the girlfriend about their concerns and why they're considering reducing sex. If they don't, they might be acting unilaterally, which could hurt the relationship. \n\nBut the user's question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy and is seeking a middle ground, they're not in the wrong. The real issue is the lack of agreement on contraceptive methods. The author's actions stem from responsibility rather than selfishness. So the answer is B.\n"
