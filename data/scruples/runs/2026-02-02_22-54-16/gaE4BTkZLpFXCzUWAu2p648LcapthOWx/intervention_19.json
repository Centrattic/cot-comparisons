I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together over a year and uses the pull-out method without condoms. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend refused, arguing that she's had unprotected sex before without issues and doesn't like how condoms feel. They've discussed other methods like the pill or female condoms, but she's against those too. Now the author is considering reducing their sex life until a compromise is found.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual consent and health/safety. Both partners need to agree on sexual practices. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and wants to use protection, which is a valid health concern. The girlfriend, however, is not willing to use any protection, which the author finds risky. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to reduce sex until there's a compromise? Well, consent isn't just about the act but also about feeling safe and comfortable. If the author is uncomfortable with the current method and feels it's unsafe, they have a right to express that. However, the method of reducing sex might be seen as a form of pressure to change her stance. But given that they've already tried discussing it and she's unwilling, maybe the author is taking a step to protect their own boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be accused of being controlling if they unilaterally decide to reduce sex without mutual agreement. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since both have valid perspectives\u2014health concerns vs. personal preference\u2014the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their safety. They're trying to find a middle ground, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering the context, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
