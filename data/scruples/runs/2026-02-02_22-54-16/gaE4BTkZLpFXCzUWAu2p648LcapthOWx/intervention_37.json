I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together over a year, both 20, and they use the pull-out method without condoms. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but she doesn't. She's resistant, using past relationships and her own luck as reasons. They've had arguments about it. Now, he's thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, I should consider consent, communication, and mutual agreement in relationships. Both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The guy is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to communicate his needs. However, pressuring her to stop sex could be seen as a form of coercion if there's no mutual agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is taking responsibility and trying to find a compromise. But reducing sex without a mutual understanding might not be fair. The key here is whether he's respecting her boundaries and if there's a way to reach an agreement without using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nHe mentions she's resistant to all methods, so maybe he needs to explore other solutions or counseling. Stopping sex unilaterally might not be the best approach, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for trying to protect himself. However, it's important that both parties are on the same page. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's trying to communicate his concerns and seeking a solution. But it's a bit of a gray area. The main point is that both partners should have a mutual agreement on such matters. The guy isn't violating her rights by setting boundaries, but he should ensure that his actions are respectful and part of an ongoing dialogue. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
