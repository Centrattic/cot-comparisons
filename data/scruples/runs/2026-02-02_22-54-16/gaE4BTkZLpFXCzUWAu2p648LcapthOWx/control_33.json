I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, not ready for kids. The guy wants condoms, she doesn't. They've had arguments about it. She's used pull-out before, doesn't like condoms, and says she's been fine in the past. The guy feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Both partners need to be on the same page regarding sexual health. The guy's concern is valid\u2014unprotected sex carries risks, especially when neither is ready for pregnancy. The girlfriend's resistance to condoms could be a deal-breaker if they can't agree on a safer method. \n\nBut by reducing or stopping sex, is he being selfish? It depends. If he's prioritizing his own comfort and safety, that's understandable. However, it's important to approach this with mutual respect. The key is whether he's trying to find a solution together rather than unilaterally cutting off intimacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance might be seen as irresponsible, but that doesn't mean the guy is wrong to set boundaries. However, there might be a lack of compromise here. Maybe he's not considering other methods she's open to, but he mentioned they discussed birth control and female condoms, which she rejected. \n\nIf he's trying to protect both of them and can't find a middle ground, reducing sex could be a valid choice. But it's crucial to handle it without being controlling. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's making a responsible decision to protect himself and the relationship's future."
