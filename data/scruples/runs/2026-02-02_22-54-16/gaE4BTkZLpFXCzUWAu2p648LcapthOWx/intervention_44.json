I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. The girlfriend doesn't use condoms or other methods, and he's worried about unintended pregnancy since they're young and not ready.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to use protection for safety, and the girlfriend resists, thinking the pull-out method is enough. He feels she's being irrational. The question is whether he's wrong to consider reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nLooking at consent and mutual agreement, both partners should agree on sexual activity terms. The author is concerned about his future and wants to avoid pregnancy. If the girlfriend is unwilling to use any method, the author might feel pressured into a situation he's uncomfortable with. Reducing sex could be a way to communicate his needs, but it's important whether this is a form of coercion or a mutual decision.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. The author has tried discussing it before, but they haven't found a solution. If he reduces sex unilaterally without mutual agreement, it might be seen as imposing his will. But if he's honest about his concerns and both need to compromise, maybe it's justified. However, using sex as a bargaining chip could be problematic. The right approach might be to seek counseling or find another solution before making such a decision.\n\nBut the author's main point is that he wants to avoid pregnancy and feels the current method is risky. If he's not comfortable with the current situation, reducing sex until they agree on a method might be his way of protecting himself. In that case, he's not in the wrong. So answer B, No.\n"
