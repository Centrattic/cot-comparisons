I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and they use the pull-out method without other protection. The guy wants to use condoms because they can't handle children right now. The girlfriend refuses, argues that she's been fine without them before, and doesn't like the feel. They've had arguments, and he's feeling conflicted about imposing his will.\n\nThe main issue is about responsibility and mutual agreement on contraception. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. However, the girlfriend isn't willing to use any method except the pull-out, which he finds risky. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page regarding safe sex. The author is advocating for a method he believes is safer. But he's also considering reducing sex, which could be seen as a power move if not discussed properly. However, he's trying to find a compromise, not force his will. The girlfriend isn't open to other methods like the pill or female condoms, so maybe there's a communication issue. The key is whether the author is taking responsibility for his concerns without being coercive. Since he's trying to find a middle ground and not just stop sex abruptly, he's probably not in the wrong. But the situation needs mutual respect and understanding. The answer might be B.\n"
