I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend over the use of protection. \n\nFirst, the context: both are 20, not in a position for kids. The guy wants condoms, she doesn't. They've had arguments about it. She's used pull-out before, doesn't want to use condoms or other methods. The author is conflicted between not wanting to impose but also feeling it's irresponsible.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, he's trying to protect both of them from an unwanted pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend is being resistant, maybe even a bit irrational, according to him. But he's considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. \n\nBut wait, relationships require compromise. If he's okay with not having sex as much to avoid conflict and risk, does that make him wrong? Or is he just prioritizing safety? On the other hand, withholding sex as a means to force her to agree might not be fair. However, he's not threatening; he's saying he might reduce it himself until they find a solution. \n\nThe key here is whether his actions are manipulative or self-preservation. Since he's not pressuring her but setting boundaries for himself, it's more about personal responsibility. The girlfriend is the one not using protection, so he's trying to protect himself. The author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to ensure safety, even if it affects their intimacy. So answer B.\n"
