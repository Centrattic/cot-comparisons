I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe couple has been together over a year, both are 20, living with parents, and not in a place to have kids. The guy has tried to use condoms before but the girlfriend didn't want to. Now the guy is concerned about the pull-out method being unsafe. The girlfriend argues that she's never used condoms before and never got pregnant, and she doesn't like how they feel. She's also against other methods like birth control or female condoms. The guy feels she's being irrational and is thinking about reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I should consider the guy's perspective. He's responsible, aware of the risks, and wants to prevent pregnancy. He's tried to communicate his concerns but isn't getting through. The girlfriend's stance is that she's comfortable with the current method, even if it's less safe. She might feel that the guy is being controlling or not respecting her preferences. \n\nThe question is whether the guy is in the wrong for potentially reducing sex. If he's trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, it's a valid concern. However, using the threat of reducing intimacy as leverage could be seen as manipulative. Healthy communication is key in relationships. The guy hasn't given up trying to find a compromise, like suggesting male condoms again, but she's resistant. Maybe there's another solution, like discussing emergency contraception if needed, but that's not a regular method.\n\nThe guy's actions are driven by his responsibility and fear of consequences. But changing the frequency of sex based on this disagreement might be a form of pressure. It's a tough spot because both parties have valid points. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined, while the guy is trying to ensure safety. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the approach. If he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe there's a way to negotiate without reducing sex. However, if he's making a decision unilaterally, that could be problematic. The question is whether reducing sex is a fair response. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's trying to protect himself, but he should consider if there's a better way to communicate without using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's refusal to use protection might be a dealbreaker for him. If they can't find a solution, maybe the relationship isn't compatible in this aspect. But reducing sex without a clear compromise could strain trust. The guy's intention is to avoid pregnancy, which is reasonable, but his method of achieving it might be seen as coercive. \n\nI think the key is whether he's respecting her autonomy while also standing by his own needs. If he's open to exploring all options, including alternatives she's willing to try, then maybe it's not his fault. But since she's resistant to all methods, he might need to consider if staying in the relationship is viable if this issue isn't resolved. However, the immediate question is whether he's in the wrong for reducing sex. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, both share some. The guy is prioritizing safety, which is reasonable. The girlfriend is prioritizing her comfort. Reducing sex could be a last resort, but it's a significant step. If he's transparent about his concerns and they can't reach an agreement, maybe he's justified. But using sex as a control mechanism is usually frowned upon. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both have valid points. His actions are driven by responsibility, but the method might need adjustment.\n"
