I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they can't agree on using protection. The main issue here is the use of the pull-out method versus condoms or other forms of contraception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are 20 and not ready for children. The author has tried to push for condoms, but the girlfriend is resistant. She argues that she's never used condoms in her past, hasn't gotten pregnant, and doesn't like the feeling. The author feels it's unsafe and is considering reducing sex to find a compromise.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author has tried discussing it, there have been arguments, and they're at an impasse. The author's main concern is the risk of pregnancy without proper protection. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels the pull-out method is sufficient and is not willing to use other methods. \n\nLegally and ethically, it's about consent and mutual agreement. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to do anything; they're considering personal choices based on their own comfort level. If the author feels uncomfortable continuing without protection, it's their right to set boundaries. However, the decision to reduce or stop sex might affect the relationship dynamics. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being selfish or acting in their best interest. The author argues it's for safety, while the girlfriend feels the current method is enough. Since they can't reach a middle ground, the author is trying to find a solution that works for them. The author isn't pressuring the girlfriend to use methods she's against but is considering their own limits. \n\nIn such cases, it's often advised to seek a compromise or counseling. If that's not possible, individuals have the right to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their own interests, especially regarding potential parenthood they're not ready for. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
