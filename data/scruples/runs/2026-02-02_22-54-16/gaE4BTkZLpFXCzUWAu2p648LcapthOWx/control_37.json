I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop or reduce sex with his girlfriend because she doesn't use protection. The situation is that they're both 20, in a year-long relationship, and they're using the pull-out method without condoms. The author wants to use condoms for safety, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she's never used them before, they don't feel good, and she's been lucky. The author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners should agree on the level of risk they're comfortable with. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and economic/emotional readiness, which are valid concerns. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is resistant to using condoms and other methods, which she might feel is her right.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex to address his safety concerns? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author has tried discussing it multiple times, and there's no resolution. If they can't agree, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries to protect himself. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of coercion if it's used as punishment, but here it's framed as a way to find a middle ground. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but is trying to find a compromise.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is risky from a health and pregnancy perspective, but she has her own preferences. The author isn't forcing her to use protection, just expressing his need for it. It's a matter of balancing personal boundaries. Since the author is trying to communicate and find a solution, his actions could be seen as responsible. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no coercion or manipulation. The author is setting his own boundaries, which is his right, as long as it's not controlling or abusive. Since he's seeking a middle ground, it's a reasonable approach.\n"
