I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThey've been together over a year, both are 20, living with their parents. The guy has insisted on using condoms before because he's not ready for kids economically or emotionally. The girlfriend didn't want to, they argued, and then they continued without protection. Now, the guy is feeling more concerned about the lack of protection and wants to bring it up again. The girlfriend's reasons are that she didn't use condoms in her past relationship and never got pregnant, she prefers the pull-out method and doesn't like how condoms feel. He argues that she's lucky, and that condoms are safer. She says using condoms when pulling out is pointless. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to do that. Let's break it down. First, the guy's position is about safety and responsibility. He's not ready for parenthood, so he's trying to prevent pregnancy. The girlfriend is resistant, maybe because of past experiences or personal preferences. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual consent are key. The guy has tried to express his concerns before, and they had arguments. Now he's considering taking action (reducing sex) to push for a compromise. But is that fair? Is he overstepping by imposing his will?\n\nOn one hand, he's acting to protect his future and their relationship from an unintended pregnancy. It's a valid concern, especially if they're not prepared. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that his decision to reduce intimacy is a punishment or not considering her needs. If they can't agree, the guy's choice to change the frequency of their sex could be seen as a form of pressure, maybe even emotional manipulation. \n\nHowever, if he's transparent about his reasons and they can communicate openly, maybe it's a reasonable step. The problem is that they haven't found a middle ground yet. The girlfriend is against all forms of protection except the pull-out method, which he's already using. If he feels that the pull-out method isn't sufficient and they can't agree on other methods, then reducing sex until they find a solution might be his way of being responsible. But is it his right to do so unilaterally?\n\nAlso, the fact that they're not using any protection besides pull-out is a risk. The guy is concerned, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's argument is that she's been fine before, but that's not a reliable basis for future decisions. The guy's approach could be seen as prioritizing his own safety and the couple's stability. \n\nBut is reducing or stopping sex a fair ultimatum? Some might say that in a consensual relationship, each partner has the right to set boundaries for their comfort. If they can't agree on a method, then maybe one of them has to compromise. However, if the guy is making a unilateral decision without resolving the underlying issue, that could create tension. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's using this as a way to pressure her without working together. If he's willing to discuss and find a middle ground, maybe it's justified. But if he just stops without trying to understand her perspective or offering alternatives, that could be wrong. The article mentions that she's against all protection methods, so if the guy can't accept that, he might need to make a choice. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, both partners should be on the same page regarding contraception. If one is not willing to meet the other's needs, the other might have to make a decision. But reducing sex without agreement could be seen as a form of control. Yet, given the high risk of pregnancy without protection, the guy's stance is about his own boundaries and health. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to protect both of them by setting a boundary. The answer should be B.\n"
