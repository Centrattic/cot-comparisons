I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over a year, both are 20, and they're using the pull-out method without condoms. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend resists because she doesn't like how they feel and claims she's been fine in the past. The author feels she's being irrational and is now considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The girlfriend is not using any method the author prefers, which creates a conflict. The author is concerned about potential pregnancy they can't handle financially or emotionally. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex. From a consent and health perspective, the author has a right to express his concerns. However, reducing or stopping sex without a mutual agreement might be seen as a way to avoid the issue rather than resolving it. The author's approach could be seen as a communication problem if he hasn't clearly expressed the risks and sought a compromise. \n\nBut considering the girlfriend's resistance and the author's valid concerns about responsibility, it's not necessarily the author's fault. However, the author should ensure that any decision to reduce intimacy is discussed and agreed upon by both partners. If he does it unilaterally without dialogue, that could be problematic. However, the scenario states that he's considering doing so to find a middle ground, which implies he's trying to find a solution, not just imposing his will.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his health and financial stability, but the method of reducing sex might be a temporary measure while seeking a compromise. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his boundaries. However, if he acts without considering her feelings or not finding a mutual solution, that could be an issue. But given the context, the author's intentions are reasonable.\n"
