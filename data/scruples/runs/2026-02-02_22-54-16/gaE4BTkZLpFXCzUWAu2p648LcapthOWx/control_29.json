I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over a year, both 20, no protection except pull-out. The guy wants to use condoms; the girlfriend refuses, saying she's never used them before and doesn't like the feel. They've had arguments about it. He's concerned about unintended pregnancy and their inability to handle it financially or emotionally. Now he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nI need to evaluate if he's wrong for wanting to do that. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual responsibility. \n\nThe author is trying to address a legitimate concern about safety. Using no protection except pull-out is risky, and he's trying to communicate that. His girlfriend isn't budging, so he's considering reducing sex to avoid risk. \n\nIs reducing sex an imposition? It depends on mutual agreement. If he communicates his boundaries and it's a mutual decision, it's okay. But if he's unilaterally deciding without discussing, maybe not. However, the post says he's trying to find a middle ground, which suggests he's looking for a solution. \n\nHe's not forcing her to use condoms, but he wants to protect himself. It's his right to set boundaries for his comfort and safety. The girlfriend's refusal isn't a deal-breaker for him yet, but he's concerned about risk. \n\nPossible angles: Is he being selfish? He argues it's for both their safety. She's not considering alternatives like female condoms or birth control. He's trying to find a compromise. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's stance might be risky, but it's her choice. However, since both are involved, mutual decisions are necessary. The author's action is a response to her not meeting his safety needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on safety measures. If she's unwilling, it's a conflict. The author is trying to address it by adjusting his behavior to protect himself. That seems reasonable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's advocating for his boundaries and safety. The answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
