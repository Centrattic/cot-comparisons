I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, both 20, and they're not using protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on condoms before but the girlfriend didn't want them, arguing that she's been fine before and dislikes condom feel. They've discussed other methods like birth control or female condoms, but she's against those too.\n\nSo the author is conflicted between respecting her desires and wanting to be responsible. They're thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in relationships. The author is trying to express their concerns about unprotected sex, which is a valid health and safety issue. However, the girlfriend is against using any protection. The author is considering reducing sex to avoid the risk of pregnancy, which they might feel is necessary for their own well-being and future. But is it wrong to potentially reduce or stop sex because of differing views on contraception?\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have a say in sexual health. The author's stance is about preventing pregnancy, which is responsible. However, if the girlfriend is not willing to budge, the author might feel they can't take the risk. But withholding sex as a means of enforcing their preference could be seen as a power play. However, if the author is uncomfortable and wants to protect themselves, maybe it's reasonable to set a boundary.\n\nThe key factors here are communication, respect, and mutual consent. The author has tried discussing it before, and the girlfriend remains firm. The author is considering their own limits. In that case, it's not necessarily wrong to reduce sex if they feel they can't proceed without protection. But it's important to approach this with empathy and understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own safety. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
