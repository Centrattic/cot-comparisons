I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they don't agree on using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in a one-year relationship, both 20 years old, living with their parents, and not ready for kids. They\u2019ve been using the pull-out method without other protection. The author wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, arguing she\u2019s never used them before and never got pregnant, and that condoms don't feel good. She also mentions that condoms can break, so if they use them, there's no point in pulling out. The author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted between their desire for protection and not wanting to impose constraints.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B) in considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points are the couple's differing views on contraception. The author wants to use condoms to avoid pregnancy, which is a valid concern, especially given their age and living situation. The girlfriend is resistant, which could be due to personal preference or past experiences. \n\nThe author is thinking of reducing sex to push for a compromise. Is that reasonable? Well, using sex as leverage can be problematic. It might be seen as a form of withholding intimacy to change someone's behavior, which could be manipulative. However, the author is also considering their own safety and future, so there's a balance here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The fact that they've had multiple discussions and haven't reached an agreement suggests that there's a lack of consensus. The author's motivation is to avoid an unintended pregnancy, which is responsible. But how to approach it? If they reduce sex, does that put the onus on the other person to agree, or is it a way to protect themselves?\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's refusal to use any form of protection beyond pull-out could be risky. The author is right to point out that she might be lucky so far, but that doesn't eliminate the risk. The pull-out method isn't foolproof. The author is trying to find a middle ground, which is commendable. However, suggesting reducing sex might be seen as a passive-aggressive tactic rather than an open discussion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they are trying to find a solution without pressuring their partner, but using sex as a bargaining chip, maybe. But they do mention it's to find a middle ground. It's a tough spot. The alternative is continuing without protection, which the author is uncomfortable with. So they're trying to balance their needs against their partner's.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're acting in good faith to protect themselves and their future. However, they should consider better communication strategies rather than reducing sex, which might not be effective. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the author isn't forcing her to use condoms but is trying to negotiate, and given the risk of pregnancy, they\u2019re not wrong.\n"
