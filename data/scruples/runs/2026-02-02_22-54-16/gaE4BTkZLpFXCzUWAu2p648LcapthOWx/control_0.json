I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The situation involves the girlfriend not wanting to use condoms or other birth control methods, relying on the pull-out method instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relationship implications here. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy, which is valid, given their age and financial situation. The girlfriend has a history of not using protection in past relationships and is resistant to using condoms now, citing personal preference (they don't feel good) and a belief that the pull-out method is sufficient. She also argues that since condoms can break, there's no point in using them.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel it's irresponsible, and they're trying to find a compromise, but the girlfriend isn't budging. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to consider reducing sex until they reach a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have a right to their own comfort and safety. The author is prioritizing their own concerns about unintended pregnancy, which is a reasonable stance. However, the author is considering taking away sexual activity as a consequence, which could be seen as a form of coercion or punishment if it's not a mutual agreement. \n\nBut wait, in a relationship, partners can set boundaries based on their own comfort levels. If one partner is uncomfortable with the level of risk, it's reasonable to seek a compromise. If the other partner is unwilling to budge, then the first partner has the right to say that they can't continue engaging in the behavior that makes them uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, reducing or stopping sex entirely might be a heavy-handed approach. It could be seen as withdrawing from the relationship emotionally or physically, which might not be fair if the issue can be resolved through communication. The author is trying to find a middle ground, which is positive. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering this step.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical wrongdoing, the author isn't doing anything illegal. The moral aspect depends on the relationship dynamics. If the author is acting in good faith to protect both themselves and the relationship in the long term, it's not necessarily wrong. But if they're using their desire to avoid pregnancy as a way to control the relationship, that would be problematic. \n\nThe key points are mutual consent and communication. The author has discussed the issue, tried to find solutions, and the girlfriend remains unwilling. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking their own comfort and safety. The girlfriend's refusal to use protection is a personal choice, but it's still a valid choice. The author's response is about protecting their own interests, which is a right they have in a relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in their own best interest regarding a significant life decision and trying to find a compromise. They are not imposing a constraint out of nowhere without discussion; they've attempted communication and are now considering a boundary that's necessary for their well-being.\n"
