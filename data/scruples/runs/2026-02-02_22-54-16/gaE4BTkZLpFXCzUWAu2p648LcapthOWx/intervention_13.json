I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they want to use condoms. The author's main concern is that they don't want to risk an unintended pregnancy due to their current financial and emotional situation. They've tried discussing it multiple times, and the girlfriend refuses to use protection, relying on the pull-out method and her past experiences. She's not interested in other methods like birth control or female condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from an ethical and relational standpoint. The author is acting in good faith, trying to protect both himself and his girlfriend from potential consequences they're not ready for. The girlfriend's stance seems to be based on personal preference and past luck, which might not be reliable. The author feels that continuing unprotected sex is irresponsible, and he's considering reducing the frequency to find a middle ground.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety? In relationships, communication and mutual agreement on such issues are crucial. The author has made his concerns known but hasn't found a solution yet. Reducing sex could be a way to emphasize the importance of this issue without forcing her to comply. However, it's important whether this action is coercive or a reasonable compromise. Since the author is seeking a middle ground, it seems like a legitimate effort to address his valid concerns. The girlfriend's refusal to consider other methods might be the root of the problem here. \n\nLegally and ethically, neither is in the wrong for having different needs, but the author has the right to set boundaries to protect himself. The key is mutual respect and finding a solution both can agree on. Since the author is trying to communicate and seek a compromise, it's not about being right or wrong but about managing their respective needs. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
