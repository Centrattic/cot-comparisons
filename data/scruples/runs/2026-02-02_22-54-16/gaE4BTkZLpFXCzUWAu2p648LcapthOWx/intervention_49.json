I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use condoms or other forms of birth control. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents, so they probably aren't financially ready for kids.\n\nThe author tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't like them and they had an argument. Now he's reconsidering the lack of protection as irresponsible. She says she's been fine in past relationships without them and they don't feel good, but he argues it's a compromise and she's just been lucky. She also mentions the chance of condoms breaking, but he counters that the risk is lower. He's considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop or reduce sex. On one hand, the girlfriend is the one not using protection, which could lead to unintended pregnancy. The author's concern seems valid, especially since they both are young. But the girlfriend has her own reasons and preferences. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is important in a relationship. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of punishment or a power play. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions are reasonable. Setting boundaries for safety is okay, but doing so by reducing intimacy might be a bit drastic. The key here is communication and mutual agreement. The author has tried discussing it, but they haven't found a compromise yet. Maybe he should explore other birth control options with her, like the pill or IUDs, but she's not open to those. \n\nIf he stops sex, is that fair? The girlfriend is the one not using protection, so the author is protecting himself. But if the girlfriend is the only one using the pull-out method, which is less reliable, then he's taking a risk. The author might feel that he's being forced to take that risk, so his decision to reduce sex could be a way to express his boundaries. However, in the context of a relationship, both partners should ideally agree on contraceptive methods. If she's unwilling to budge, then maybe he's justified in his stance. \n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe he could suggest another method she might be more open to, even if it's not condoms. The pull-out method is about 78% effective, while condoms are around 87-98% effective when used correctly. So the author is right that the risk is higher without them. However, the girlfriend's comfort is also a factor. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to set a boundary to prevent pregnancy when they both are not ready. But the approach of reducing sex might be seen as a conflict tactic. The right answer is probably B (No), because he's acting in his own interests to prevent an unintended pregnancy, and it's a valid boundary. However, it's important that he's open to finding a middle ground rather than just imposing it. Since he mentions he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe the step he's taking is reasonable.\n"
