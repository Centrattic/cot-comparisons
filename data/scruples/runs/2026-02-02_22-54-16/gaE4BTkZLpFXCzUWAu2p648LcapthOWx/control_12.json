I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. The situation involves them being in a one-year relationship, both 20 years old, and using the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend resists, citing past experiences and personal preference. They've had arguments about this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being reasonable. The key factors here are consent, mutual agreement in relationships, and health/safety. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and wants to use protection, which is responsible. However, the girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms and has other reasons. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, which is good. But pushing to reduce intimacy without a mutual agreement could be seen as a conflict. However, the girlfriend is not open to other forms of birth control either, so there's a lack of compromise.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions are respectful and based on mutual consent. If he's trying to pressure her into using protection without considering her feelings, he might be wrong. But if he's setting boundaries for his own comfort and health, that's understandable.\n\nThe author is not forcing her but considering reducing sex until they find a solution. That's a personal choice, but it's important to ensure it's done respectfully. Since the girlfriend is not open to any protection methods, the author might feel his boundaries are valid. So, the answer might be B (No), because he's acting in his own interests for safety, but there's a nuance here. However, the main issue is whether reducing sex is a valid action. In relationships, when there's a disagreement on such a critical issue, it's reasonable to adjust intimacy levels to avoid compromising either partner's well-being. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
