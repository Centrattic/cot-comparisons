I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to their disagreement over protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms for safety, but the girlfriend resists, arguing she's never used them before, doesn't like the feel, and claims they're unnecessary because the pull-out is enough. They've had arguments about this, and the author feels she's being irrational. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, mutual agreement on sexual health, and the potential consequences. The girlfriend's stance is that she's comfortable with the current method and doesn't want to use condoms. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and wants to use protection. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on birth control methods. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current approach but the other isn't, there's a conflict. The author is trying to protect himself from a situation he's not prepared for (fathership), which is understandable. However, pressuring the other to use a method they dislike isn't ideal either. \n\nThe question is whether reducing or stopping sex is justified. If the author feels that continuing without protection is risky and he's not comfortable, then setting boundaries by reducing intimacy could be his way of prioritizing his own well-being. But does that make him wrong? It depends on the ethical framework applied. \n\nFrom a rights-based perspective, both partners have the right to express their needs. If the author is trying to communicate his concerns and the girlfriend isn't budging, he might be justified in adjusting his behavior to avoid a situation he's not ready for. However, if reducing sex without discussion is seen as a unilateral decision without compromise, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the author mentions they've discussed this multiple times and the girlfriend remains firm. In that case, trying to set boundaries is reasonable. The author isn't forcing her to use something she doesn't want; he's trying to find a middle ground but hasn't found one yet. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because he's making decisions to protect himself within the context of a disagreement where consensus isn't possible. However, it's important that he communicates this decision clearly rather than just reducing sex without explanation. But based on the scenario as presented, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety.\n"
