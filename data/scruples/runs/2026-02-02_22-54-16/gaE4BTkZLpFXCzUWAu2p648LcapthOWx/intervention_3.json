I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering stopping or reducing sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, using pull-out method without condoms. The author wants protection because they can't handle kids financially or emotionally. The girlfriend refuses, says she's been fine in the past, doesn't like condoms, and thinks the pull-out is enough. They've had arguments about it. Author feels conflicted between not wanting to impose but also not wanting to risk pregnancy.\n\nThe main points here are consent, responsibility, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The girlfriend is refusing to use protection, and the author is uncomfortable with the risk. The key question is whether the author has a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on safety measures. The girlfriend's stance might be based on past experiences, but that doesn't negate the current risks. The author is trying to communicate their concerns, which is responsible. If communication isn't working, reducing sexual activity to avoid compromising their own values or safety could be a reasonable step. \n\nHowever, the author needs to approach this respectfully. Abruptly stopping sex without discussion might escalate conflict. But given that they've tried multiple times and the girlfriend remains unwilling, the author's decision to reduce sex until they find a middle ground could be seen as protecting their own interests. \n\nIt's important to consider whether the girlfriend is being negligent. She's aware of the risks but dismisses them. The author's actions are a way to enforce their boundaries when mutual agreement isn't possible. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to set these boundaries to prevent unwanted pregnancy. The answer should be B (No).\n"
