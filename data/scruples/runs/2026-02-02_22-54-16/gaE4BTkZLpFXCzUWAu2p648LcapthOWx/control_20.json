I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they don't agree on using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. They currently use the pull-out method but no condoms or other protection. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she doesn't like them and that she's been fine without them in the past. They've had arguments about it, and the author feels she's being irrational. Now, the author is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing that. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break it down. The core issue is consent and mutual agreement on sexual activity. The author is trying to protect himself from potential pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is not willing to use any form of protection except the pull-out method. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other won't budge, it's a valid reason to adjust the frequency of sexual activity until a compromise is reached. The author isn't being coercive; they're setting a boundary based on their own comfort and responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's a line between setting boundaries and being controlling. The author isn't refusing to have sex altogether but is considering reducing it to find a middle ground. That seems reasonable because they're trying to find a solution that works for both. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is also important. She's not willing to consider other options like birth control pills or female condoms. If she's not open to discussing alternatives, then the author is justified in feeling that they can't agree on this essential aspect of their relationship. \n\nBut is it the author's place to unilaterally reduce sex? Well, in a relationship, both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. If the author has communicated their concerns and the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, then the author isn't wrong for protecting their own interests. \n\nAnother angle: Is the author being selfish? The user mentions feeling selfish, but in this context, it's about mutual responsibility. The author is not trying to control the girlfriend but to ensure they don't face an unintended pregnancy. It's a shared responsibility, so the author's stance isn't selfish but responsible. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the author should try harder to persuade the girlfriend or that reducing sex is a form of punishment. However, the author is not cutting off sex entirely but reducing it to find a solution. It's a negotiation step. Also, if the girlfriend is unwilling to negotiate, the author is within their rights to set limits. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to find a safe middle ground and their decision to reduce sex is a reasonable step to protect both partners' interests. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
