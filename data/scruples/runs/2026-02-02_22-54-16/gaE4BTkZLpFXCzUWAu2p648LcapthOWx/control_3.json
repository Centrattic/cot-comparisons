I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection, and the guy feels it's unsafe while the girlfriend doesn't. The guy is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about not using protection. They mentioned they're both young, financially not ready for kids, and the pull-out method is the only protection. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has been in a past relationship without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant. She's against using them because of preference and past experience.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want to impose but feel it's the responsible choice. The question is whether reducing sex is the right move here. \n\nFrom a responsibility angle, the author is prioritizing safety and avoiding unintended pregnancy, which is valid. The girlfriend's stance is based on her past experience and comfort, but that might not account for the statistical risk. Condoms, while less effective than some methods, still reduce risk. The author is trying to find a compromise but she's resistant. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If he's trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, he's not wrong. However, using the threat of reducing sex to force her to agree might be a problem. But the author is not threatening; he's considering reducing sex to encourage discussion, not to punish. \n\nAlternatives could include open communication, exploring other contraceptive methods she might accept, or counseling. But since she's already against female condoms and birth control, maybe there's not much else. The author's action is a bid to ensure safety, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nPossible issues: The author should ensure that reducing sex isn't a manipulation tactic but a way to prioritize mutual safety. If he's approaching it as a way to find a compromise, it's reasonable. The girlfriend's refusal to consider any protection despite the risks could be seen as more problematic. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to responsibly address a valid concern without forcing the issue but seeking a middle ground.\n"
