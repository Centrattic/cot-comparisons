I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the condom issue. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20 years old. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms, the girlfriend doesn't. They've had arguments about it. The guy feels she's being irrational, and he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The guy has tried discussing it multiple times, and the girlfriend isn't budging. She's not open to other forms of birth control either. The guy's main concern is avoiding pregnancy because of their financial and emotional readiness. The girlfriend argues that she's been fine before and doesn't like the way condoms feel. \n\nLegally and ethically, both partners need to consent to sexual activity. If the guy feels that the current arrangement is risky for him, he has a right to set boundaries for his own comfort. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of coercion or withdrawal of intimacy, which might be problematic if it's done without mutual agreement. But the guy is trying to find a middle ground, not to punish her. \n\nCondoms are a shared responsibility. The girlfriend's refusal to use them despite the guy's concerns could lead to a situation where he feels pressured into an activity that he's uncomfortable with. On the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to her preferences in terms of sexual experience and may feel that she's taking risks she's willing to accept. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, avoiding pregnancy is a joint responsibility. If the girlfriend is adamant against any form of protection, the guy is within his rights to prioritize his own well-being. However, the approach of reducing sex might impact the relationship negatively. The key issue is whether the author is acting out of self-preservation or selfishness. \n\nThe author isn't forcing her to use condoms but is trying to find a compromise. If he's willing to try other methods she's against, like female condoms or birth control, but she refuses, then it's a stalemate. Reducing sex could be a way to express his discomfort without being confrontational. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to protect himself from potential negative outcomes. But the answer depends on whether his action is considered a reasonable boundary or an overstep. Since he's attempting to find a middle ground and hasn't completely stopped sex yet, it's a proactive step towards resolving the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
