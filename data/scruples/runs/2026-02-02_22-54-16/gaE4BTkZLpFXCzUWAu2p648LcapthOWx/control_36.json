I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to a disagreement over contraceptive use.\n\nFirst, the key points: The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're not in a position to have kids. They've used the pull-out method without condoms. The author has tried to get condoms used before but faced resistance. The girlfriend argues she's never used condoms in the past, doesn't like the feeling, and claims the pull-out is enough. She's also against other birth control methods. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until a middle ground is found.\n\nSo, the author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. He's made compromises by suggesting condoms and other methods, but she's not willing to use them. Now he's considering reducing sex to push for a safer alternative. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, both partners should have mutual consent on sexual activity. If the author is not comfortable with the current level of risk and has expressed this, it's reasonable for him to seek a compromise. However, reducing or stopping sex unilaterally could be seen as a form of coercion unless both parties agree. The girlfriend's refusal to use any contraception is a significant factor here. She's choosing a method with higher risk, which the author is against. \n\nBut is the author wrong for trying to enforce his preferences? Well, he can't force her to use protection, but he can set boundaries for himself. If he's not willing to take the risk, it's his right to say so. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014reducing sex\u2014might be a form of withholding intimacy, which can be a sensitive issue in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, she's not using any method except pull-out, which has a higher failure rate. The author is trying to protect both of them. In that sense, his actions are about mutual safety. But if he's reducing sex without her consent, that could be seen as pressuring her indirectly. However, since she's not open to any other methods, maybe the author has to make a choice between his comfort level and continuing the sexual relationship as it is.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries based on his own risk tolerance. The issue is about differing risk assessments, and he's trying to find a middle ground. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
