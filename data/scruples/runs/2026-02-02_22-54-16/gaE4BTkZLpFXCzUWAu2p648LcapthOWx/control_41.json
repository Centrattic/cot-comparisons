I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The context is that they've been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with their parents, and the girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other birth control. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and feels she's being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author has tried to discuss the issue, and there's been some arguments. The girlfriend is not willing to use any form of protection, and the author feels that continuing without it is risky, so he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to protect both of them? Yes, because both partners have a right to feel safe and secure. But can he unilaterally decide to stop or reduce sex without her consent? That's tricky. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have a say in their sexual activities. If the author feels the need to stop sex to avoid risk, but the girlfriend is not compliant with his safety concerns, it might lead to conflict. However, the author's intention is to find a compromise, so he's not just cutting off sex for no reason. He's trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut is it his right to enforce that? If they can't reach an agreement, then he's in a tough spot. Stopping sex could be seen as a form of pressure, but if he's communicated his reasons and she's not budging, maybe he's justified in trying to protect himself. The article in the question is \"What Would I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA), so the community usually looks at whether the person's actions are reasonable and if they've tried to communicate and find a solution.\n\nThe author has tried discussing it multiple times, she's resistant, and he's thinking of reducing sex. The question is if that makes him the asshole. If he's not forcing her to use protection but is instead setting a boundary for himself, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the relationship's foundation is built on mutual consent and he's reducing sex without her agreement, it could be seen as selfish. But given the high-stakes issue of pregnancy, his concerns are valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to protect both himself and his partner, and he's attempting to communicate and find a middle ground. Since the girlfriend is not willing to use any protection and the author feels it's necessary, his decision to reduce sex until there's a compromise isn't clearly wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
