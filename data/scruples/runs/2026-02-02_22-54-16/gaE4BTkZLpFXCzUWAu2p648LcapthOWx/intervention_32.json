I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The situation is about a couple in a one-year relationship where the guy wants to use condoms or another form of contraception, but the girlfriend refuses, citing past experience and preference for the pull-out method. The author is conflicted between respecting her partner's wishes and his own concerns about safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The guy is concerned about the risk of pregnancy without proper protection, especially since they're young and not in a position to have children. His desire for protection is valid and responsible. However, the girlfriend's resistance could be due to personal preference or discomfort with condoms. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex until they find a compromise. In relationships, communication and mutual consent are key. If he's tried discussing it and there's no agreement, his approach of reducing sex might be a way to prioritize his own boundaries. But does that make him in the wrong? It depends on whether he's being respectful and not being coercive. If he's not pressuring her but setting a boundary for himself, it's his right. However, if he's using this as a way to manipulate or control, that's different. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is also important. She's not willing to use any form of protection, which is her choice, but it's risky. The author is trying to find a middle ground but hasn't found one yet. So, if he decides to reduce sex, he's not forcing her but making a personal choice based on his comfort level. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should agree on contraception methods. If she's unwilling to compromise, he has the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to adjust their intimacy to align with his values. So the answer would be B.\n"
