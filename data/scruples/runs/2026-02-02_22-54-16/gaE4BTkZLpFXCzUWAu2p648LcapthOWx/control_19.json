I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. The main issue here is about birth control and mutual agreement.\n\nFirst, the author wants to use protection to avoid pregnancy, but the girlfriend is against it. She's using the pull-out method, which the author finds risky. The girlfriend has refused other methods like condoms, the pill, or female condoms. The author is conflicted between wanting to protect against pregnancy and not wanting to force the issue, leading to the idea of reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, both partners have a right to their boundaries. The author is prioritizing their own risk of unintended pregnancy, which is understandable. The girlfriend isn't meeting his needs, so he's considering reducing intimacy. But reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of punishment or coercion, especially if not discussed openly. However, it's also about mutual consent and respecting each other's comfort levels. If the author communicates their reasons clearly and they both try to find a solution together, it might be a valid approach. If he does it without discussion, it could be seen as wrong. The answer hinges on communication and mutual respect. Since the post mentions they've discussed it before and are still at an impasse, the author trying to find a middle ground is reasonable. So, probably answer B (No).\n"
