I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year, both are 20, living with parents, and not in a position for kids. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend refuses, preferring the pull-out method. She argues that she's never used condoms in the past and hasn't gotten pregnant, so it's enough. The author is concerned about the risks, even though she says the risk is low with pull-out. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's think about consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners should agree on the level of risk they're comfortable with. The author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, reducing sex because of this disagreement might be seen as a way to avoid communication. But the author is trying to find a middle ground, which is good. \n\nThe girlfriend isn't using any other forms of birth control either, so the author's push for condoms is reasonable. But he's also acknowledging that it's her preference and not wanting to be controlling. The key here is whether he's being respectful of her boundaries while advocating for his own. If he's not pressuring her but instead trying to find a compromise, then maybe he's not wrong. However, stopping sex unilaterally without her agreement might be seen as a power move. \n\nBut the scenario says he's considering reducing sex until a middle ground is found. That suggests he's still open to discussion. So, he's not just cutting it off but trying to negotiate. In that case, he's acting in his own best interest and hers by avoiding risks. Since both can't agree, it's a matter of personal choice and responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have mutual consent on such issues. The author is trying to set a boundary for his comfort level, which is okay. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
