I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they disagree on using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and not ready for children. They've been using the pull-out method without condoms. The author tried to introduce condoms before, but the girlfriend refused, arguing that she's been fine in the past, doesn't like how condoms feel, and that the chance of pregnancy is low. The author is now considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nThe key issues here are consent, mutual agreement on contraception, and the health/risk factors. The author wants to use protection to avoid unintended pregnancy, which is a valid and responsible concern. The girlfriend is resistant, citing past experiences and preference. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner refuses, the other might feel pressured into an unsafe situation. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is important. However, reducing or stopping sex without mutual agreement could be seen as a form of pressure or coercion, especially if it's done unilaterally without resolving the underlying issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by considering this step. Legally and ethically, both partners should have autonomy. If the author decides to reduce sex to prioritize their own safety, but this might not be the best approach because it could be seen as a power play rather than a collaborative solution. The right approach would be to seek a compromise, perhaps exploring other contraceptive methods they both agree on, counseling, or setting boundaries that respect both sides. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to address a legitimate health concern. The girlfriend's stance is risky, and the author has the right to advocate for their own safety. That said, imposing their will by reducing sex without a mutual decision might not be fair. The author's intention is to protect both of them, but the method could be problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Possibly not entirely, as they're acting out of concern for both parties. But the approach might need adjustment. The answer is B, not in the wrong, because the intention is responsible, though the method could use more collaboration.\n"
