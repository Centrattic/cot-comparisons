I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, living with parents, and not in a position for kids. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't want to. They use the pull-out method. The author is now concerned about the risks and wants to use protection again. The girlfriend argues that she's never needed it before, doesn't like condoms, and thinks the chance of pregnancy is low. The author is torn between being a compromise and feeling it's risky, considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, which is a responsible stance. The girlfriend is resistant, maybe due to past habits or preference. The author is considering reducing sex to push for a safer method. Is that wrong?\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about consent and mutual agreement. The author is trying to communicate their concerns and find a solution. However, reducing or stopping sex without agreement might be seen as a form of pressure or control. But the author isn't forcing the issue; they're trying to find a middle ground. They've discussed other methods like birth control and female condoms, which she's against. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for safety, but the way they're handling it could be problematic if it's unilateral.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to set boundaries for their own comfort and safety, which they have the right to do. The girlfriend isn't considering the risks as seriously as the author. The author's approach to reduce sex might be a way to get their needs met. Since they've had arguments and attempts to compromise without success, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, communication is key. If they haven't fully exhausted all options or if the approach is too abrupt, maybe the author's method could be better. But overall, the intention is to prevent pregnancy, which is valid. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
