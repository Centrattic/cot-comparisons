I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The context is that they've been together a year, both 20, and he's concerned about possible pregnancy. They've tried to use pull-out but she doesn't like condoms. He's conflicted between wanting to be safe and not wanting to impose.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is trying to protect himself from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern, especially since they're young and not in a position for kids. The girlfriend doesn't want to use protection, citing past relationships and personal preference. She's been lucky so far, but that's not a guarantee. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex. Legally and ethically, consent and mutual agreement are key. If they can't agree on protection, the author has a right to set boundaries to protect himself. However, communication is important. Has he tried all possible solutions? They've discussed other methods like the pill and female condoms, but she's against them. Maybe there's another angle, like emergency contraception, but that's reactive. \n\nIt's a matter of health and responsibility. The author's stance is about being responsible, which is understandable. The girlfriend's resistance might be based on past experiences, but that doesn't negate the current risks. If the author feels that continuing without protection compromises his values or safety, he's not wrong to seek a compromise. Reducing sex could be a way to push for a solution that works for both. \n\nBut is it the author's fault for imposing his will? If there's a mutual agreement that's not reached, then setting a boundary isn't wrong. Both have different needs here. The author isn't wrong to prioritize his own safety, even if it means changing the frequency of their sexual activity. So, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
