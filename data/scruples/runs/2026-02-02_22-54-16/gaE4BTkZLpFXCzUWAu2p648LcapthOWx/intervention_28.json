I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for potentially reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to their disagreement over using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents. The author has previously insisted on condoms, but the girlfriend refused, using the pull-out method. Now, the author is concerned about the risks and wants to use protection, but the girlfriend is resistant, citing past experiences and discomfort with condoms. She's also against other methods like birth control or female condoms.\n\nThe author is considering reducing their sexual activity until they can find a middle ground. The question is whether this decision makes him the \"wrong\" one (A) or not (B). \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. \n\nKey points to consider: The author is prioritizing safety and responsibility, which is reasonable, especially since they cannot support children financially or emotionally. The girlfriend is being resistant, possibly due to past habits or discomfort. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, which shows he's trying to find a solution. However, using the threat of reducing sex could be seen as a form of leverage, which might not be healthy. Relationships should involve mutual consent and compromise. If one partner's needs are being ignored, it's a problem. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the girlfriend to do anything; he's considering adjusting his own behavior to encourage a safer approach. However, reducing sexual activity could be a form of coercion if it's intended to pressure her into compliance. Alternatively, it's a legitimate boundary to protect himself from potential risks. \n\nThe ethical aspect here is about mutual responsibility. The girlfriend is taking risks that the author is uncomfortable with. The author's action is about protecting himself, which is not inherently wrong. But the method of doing so by reducing sex might be problematic if it's manipulative. However, the author is open to finding a middle ground, which is positive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to address a legitimate concern, and while the method might be questionable, his intentions are valid. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
