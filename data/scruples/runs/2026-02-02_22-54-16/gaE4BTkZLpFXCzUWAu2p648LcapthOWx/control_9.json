I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether or not to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they can't agree on using protection. The author is 20, they've been together over a year, and they don't use condoms except for pull-out. The girlfriend is resistant to using any protection, saying she's never used them before and never got pregnant, and she doesn't like how condoms feel. The author is concerned about being responsible and not wanting kids right now, both financially and emotionally. They tried bringing it up again, leading to another argument, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's concern about protection and their partner's refusal to use it. The author feels their partner is being irrational, but they also don't want to seem selfish by imposing their will. They're considering reducing sex to push for a compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is expressing a valid concern about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved. They've tried discussing it before, and the partner is not budging. The author is looking for a way to balance their own needs with their partner's preferences. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should ideally have mutual agreement and respect for each other's boundaries. The author's desire to use protection is responsible, especially given their age and financial situation. However, pushing for a complete stop or reduction in sex could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy to make a point, which might be considered manipulative. But if they're doing it to protect themselves from potential consequences they can't handle, it's a self-protective measure.\n\nThe partner's stance is that she doesn't want to use protection, even though the author has valid points about the risks. She's relying on past luck, which isn't a reliable strategy. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but she's not open to alternatives like birth control or female condoms. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. The author is trying to be responsible, while the partner is not. The author's decision to reduce sex might be a way to enforce a safer approach. However, communication is key. If they haven't fully discussed the implications and the partner is unwilling to budge, the author might be left with difficult choices. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they're trying to protect themselves and their partner from an unintended pregnancy, and they're not pressuring her beyond what's necessary, maybe not. However, using the threat of reducing intimacy as leverage could be problematic. It might be seen as a form of emotional coercion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not forcing the partner to use protection; they're trying to find a compromise. The partner's refusal to consider any alternative methods complicates things. The author's action is a way to express their boundaries and protect their well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs and concerns, even if it's uncomfortable. The partner's stance is the more concerning one here, as they're dismissing the risks. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
