I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He had a group of friends that included an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out together, and Maya expressed interest in being his Valentine. The author felt conflicted because of the political tensions between their countries and ultimately rejected her, citing societal acceptance and potential family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, so he's a teenager still forming his views. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is deeply rooted and emotionally charged. The author's reasons for rejecting Maya are based on societal expectations and familial disapproval. He also mentions that he values the possibility of marriage, which implies he's thinking about long-term commitment, which at 17 might be a bit premature, but he's trying to be responsible.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's making a personal choice based on his beliefs and the environment he's coming from. It's not like he's directly harming her; he's just not pursuing a relationship. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for that choice. Some might argue that he's letting external pressures dictate his personal life instead of following his feelings. Others might say he's being realistic about potential challenges and family approval.\n\nMaya was from Israel, and the author mentions that both families would hate each other. Even though they're in the USA, cultural and political tensions can affect personal relationships. The author is acknowledging the societal issues and choosing not to proceed, which could be seen as prioritizing family and cultural values over personal feelings. But then again, the girl liked him, and he did enjoy spending time with her. Rejecting someone based on nationalities could be seen as prejudiced, even if the reasons are valid in his context.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is the asshole. The key points are: the author's reasons for rejection, the girl's perspective, and societal norms. The author isn't being malicious, but is he in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship due to external factors? It's a bit of a gray area. Some people might say no, because he's making a personal choice. Others might say yes, because he's letting political tensions interfere with a personal connection. \n\nIn the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent isn't to hurt but to avoid future conflicts. The impact is that the girl was rejected because of her nationality. So, depending on perspective, the answer could go either way. However, the author might be seen as in the right because he's being honest and considering the challenges ahead. Alternatively, he could be seen as in the wrong for not giving the relationship a chance despite the challenges.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's being upfront and making a decision based on his values and the reality of their situations. However, there's also an argument for A if the community values following one's heart over external pressures. But given the context of political tensions and family expectations, B seems more appropriate here.\n"
