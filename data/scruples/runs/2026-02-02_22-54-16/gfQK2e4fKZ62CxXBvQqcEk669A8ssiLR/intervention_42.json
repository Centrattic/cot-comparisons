I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They got along well, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They hung out a few times, and he considered it, but eventually rejected her because of societal pressures and potential family disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's a deeply sensitive and political issue, with a lot of historical and cultural tensions. The author is concerned about societal reactions and family disapproval. He mentions that his parents and hers would hate the relationship. So, he's making a decision based on real-world consequences, not just personal feelings. \n\nHe also states that he's looking for a relationship that could lead to marriage. That's a big commitment, and he's considering long-term feasibility. If society and families are against it, that could create significant stress and obstacles. He's being pragmatic here, weighing the potential challenges against the relationship's viability.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's letting external factors dictate his personal choices. Maya might not care about the political aspects and just wants a relationship. The author could be closing off future possibilities without giving it a real chance. But he also mentions that the societal backlash is real and that their families are opposed, which adds complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya's perspective isn't fully known. If she's willing to face the challenges, does he have the right to say no? But if he's not willing to go through the societal and familial pressures, it's his right to make that decision. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's not a black-and-white situation. The author is making a choice based on his values and circumstances. There's no inherent \"wrong\" in choosing not to pursue a relationship due to foreseeing significant societal and familial opposition. It's about personal boundaries and realistic expectations for the future.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on his personal values and the realities he faces. Answer B.\n"
