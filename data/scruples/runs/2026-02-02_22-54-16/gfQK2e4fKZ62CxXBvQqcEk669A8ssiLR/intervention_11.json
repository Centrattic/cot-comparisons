I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who met an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out a lot, and she asked him to be her Valentine, but he ended up rejecting her because of the political tensions between their countries. He's worried about societal reactions and the possibility of marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is deep-rooted and has significant historical and emotional weight. People on both sides often face strong societal pressures against relationships with the other side. The author mentions that his and her families would hate the relationship, and others might look down on it. So, he's making a decision based on realistic expectations of societal rejection and his personal values, like wanting a marriage that's accepted by society.\n\nBut then, is it fair to reject someone solely based on their nationality? Maya initiated contact, and they had a good time together. The author seems to have given her a chance, even though he was initially skeptical. He also considered the possibility of a relationship leading to marriage, which is a big deal. However, his decision is based on external factors (society's views) rather than the actual compatibility or feelings between them. \n\nOn one hand, he's not being dishonest. He's upfront about the reasons. On the other, he's prioritizing societal approval over his personal feelings and the potential for a relationship. But maybe it's also about practicality\u2014knowing that their relationship would face major obstacles from the start. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's wrong for considering the societal implications. Since he's clear about his stance and the reasons, and he's not leading her on, maybe it's not his fault. People have different values, and if he values societal acceptance and the possibility of marriage, his decision is his own. However, some might argue that love shouldn't be constrained by such factors, but that's a different perspective. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer is more likely B (he's not in the wrong) because he's making a conscious choice based on his values and circumstances, even if others disagree.\n"
