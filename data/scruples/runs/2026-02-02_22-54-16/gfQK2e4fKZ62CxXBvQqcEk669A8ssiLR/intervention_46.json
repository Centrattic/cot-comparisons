I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through friends. They had fun hanging out, and she asked him to be her Valentine. He considered it but ultimately rejected her due to societal pressures and family expectations from both sides. He's worried about societal acceptance and the potential for conflict because of the political situation between Palestine and Israel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue here is the political and social tensions between the two nationalities. The author isn't just rejecting someone because of personal dislike; it's because of external pressures from family and society. He mentions that both sets of parents would hate the relationship, and society would disapprove. That's a significant factor.\n\nBut wait, is it fair for him to reject her based on something beyond their control? The author himself acknowledges that Maya is a nice person, and they had a good time together. So his decision isn't based on her personality but the circumstances. However, love and relationships can be complicated, especially when there are external pressures. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his values and the reality of their situations. On the other, he's making a choice that might hurt Maya's feelings. But is he in the wrong? If he's considering long-term commitment and societal acceptance is a deal-breaker for him, maybe he's justified. But if he's letting external pressures dictate his personal choices instead of addressing them, maybe he's avoiding a potential conflict. \n\nI should also think about the AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics. The author is questioning his own actions, showing he's self-aware. The community might look at this and consider the context of political tensions. In some cultures, such relationships are stigmatized, and the individual might be expected to prioritize family and societal norms. However, others might argue that it's unfair to let political differences interfere with personal relationships. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is not forcing Maya to accept this; he's making a choice based on his own values and circumstances. Since he's 17, maybe he's still figuring out his priorities. The fact that he's considering marriage is a big deal for a teenager, but it's also a personal choice. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the decision isn't malicious. He's being honest about his limitations and the external pressures he faces. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
