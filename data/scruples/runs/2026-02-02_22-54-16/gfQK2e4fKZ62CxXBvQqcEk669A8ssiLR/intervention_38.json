I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US had a relationship with a girl from Israel, Maya. He ended up rejecting her because of their nationalities and the societal issues. The question is whether he's an asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At 17, people are still figuring out their values and how they interact with others. The author mentions that he's sensitive about Palestine, which makes sense given the complex political situation between Palestine and Israel. The societal pressures he's talking about\u2014family and others disapproving\u2014could be real. He also says that he considers marriage when dating, so he's looking for long-term compatibility. If he believes that societal acceptance is a big barrier, maybe he's being realistic about the challenges a relationship would face.\n\nBut then, there's the issue of rejecting someone based on their nationality. That could be seen as discriminatory, similar to how people might be judged for other reasons. Maya is an individual, and the author is making a decision based on her nationality rather than her personal qualities. Even if it's about societal expectations, is that a valid reason to reject someone? \n\nOn the other hand, the author does give Maya a chance, spends time with her, and seems to genuinely like her. He's not just rejecting her off the bat; he's considering the long-term implications. He's also aware that others might look down on him for being with her. Maybe he's making a pragmatic decision, even if it's painful. \n\nBut is it the right decision? Discriminating based on nationality, especially in a personal relationship, could be seen as wrong because it's about a political conflict rather than personal choice. The author is prioritizing societal approval over his feelings, which might not be fair to Maya. However, considering the real-world consequences and the pressures from both sides' families, maybe it's a realistic choice.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether rejecting her for political/ethnic reasons is acceptable. In many contexts, people are encouraged to look beyond such factors in personal relationships. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the relationship on its own merits. But if the societal pressures are indeed too strong and he's being honest about his limitations, then it's a personal choice. \n\nI'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, it's about personal freedom and not judging someone based on their nationality. On the other, he's being honest about his values and the reality of the situation. The key point is whether the rejection is based on prejudice or realistic assessment. If it's the latter, maybe he's not in the wrong. If it's the former, then he is.\n"
