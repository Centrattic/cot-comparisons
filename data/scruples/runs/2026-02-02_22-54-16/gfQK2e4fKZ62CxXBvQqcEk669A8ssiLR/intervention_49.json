I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the U.S. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through a group of friends. They hung out a bit, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They spent time together, but he rejected her when she wanted to take it further. His reason was societal pressure and the incompatibility of their backgrounds, especially since their families would hate the relationship. He's worried about others' reactions and the possibility of marriage because of the political situation.\n\nNow, to decide if he's in the wrong. On one hand, choosing a partner based on nationality could be seen as prejudiced. It's a personal choice, but some might argue it's avoiding responsibility for the relationship by using external factors as an excuse. On the other hand, societal pressures are real. Families and communities can exert a lot of influence, and the author is being honest about his concerns about acceptance and future. Also, he didn't lie; he was upfront about his reasons.\n\nThe key points: He gave her a chance, acknowledged her personality, and only rejected after considering their situations. However, some might say that personal feelings and willingness to overcome challenges could have been considered more. The author is being realistic about his environment, but others might see it as letting external factors dictate his choices.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's being honest about his circumstances and the challenges they'd face. He didn't lead her on; he clearly communicated his stance. But he could have explored whether they could overcome those obstacles. However, given the context, his decision seems based on genuine concerns rather than mere prejudice. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
