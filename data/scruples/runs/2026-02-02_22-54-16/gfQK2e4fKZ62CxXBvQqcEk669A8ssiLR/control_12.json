I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation is that they're from Palestine and Israel, which have a long-standing conflict. The author felt societal pressure and family disapproval if they were to date someone from the \"enemy\" country. He rejected her because he didn't think a long-term relationship, including marriage, was possible due to societal and family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, so he's a teenager dealing with peer pressure and family expectations. But he's also in a new country (USA) where the conflict's impact might be different. The girl, Maya, was open about her feelings and they had a good time together. He rejected her because of external factors, not because of any issues with her as a person. \n\nThe key question is whether his decision is based on prejudice or realistic expectations. The author mentions societal and family disapproval, which might be real. But is it fair to judge someone based on their nationality alone? The author didn't give her a chance to overcome those obstacles, which might be a cop-out. Also, at 17, he's still young, and relationships at that age can be about exploration. The author is avoiding a potential relationship because of political tensions, which might be seen as a lack of personal conviction or courage. On the other hand, if the societal pressures are too strong, it's understandable to be cautious. However, the decision here is to reject her outright without considering if they could work around those issues. So the author is prioritizing external factors over the relationship's potential. That could be seen as being in the wrong because he's making a decision based on nationality rather than the person's character. Plus, the girl's parents and his parents would hate each other just for the connection, which adds to the pressure. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? It's a tough call. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. If the focus is on the inherent wrongness of rejecting based on nationality regardless of context, then A. If considering the real-world challenges and the author's age, maybe B. But societal pressures are real, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, choosing someone based on nationality can be discriminatory. Hmm. Maybe A because the decision is based on prejudice, even if it's influenced by family and society.\n"
