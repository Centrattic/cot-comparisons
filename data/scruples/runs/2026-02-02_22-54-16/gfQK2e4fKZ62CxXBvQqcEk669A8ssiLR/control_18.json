I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They started hanging out, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine, which they treated as a joke. They had some one-on-one time, and she wanted to take it further. He told her he needed to think and eventually rejected her, citing societal issues and the fact that their families and society wouldn't accept a relationship between a Palestinian man and an Israeli woman.\n\nThe question is, is he the asshole? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's a deeply complex and sensitive issue with a long history of political and cultural tensions. People from both sides often face pressure from their communities to avoid relationships with the other, which can be seen as betrayal or collaboration. The author mentions that both families would hate each other, and society wouldn't accept it. That's a real concern, especially in a place like the US where there are strong diaspora communities with strong opinions.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is making a decision based on external factors rather than the actual relationship dynamics. He says he wants to ensure that a relationship could lead to marriage if they loved each other. However, he's rejecting her based on societal pressure rather than any real issues in their interactions. The fact that they got along well, had fun, and he was willing to spend time with her suggests that there was potential. By rejecting her preemptively, he's not giving the relationship a chance to develop beyond the initial stages. \n\nBut is that fair? If he's certain that societal pressures would make a long-term relationship impossible, maybe he's being realistic. However, relationships can be challenging, and many people choose to be together despite societal disapproval. The author is prioritizing his family and community's approval over the possibility of a genuine relationship. \n\nAnother angle: Maya is from Israel, but they were friends first. He didn't go into it intending to date her, and even when she asked to be his Valentine, he treated it as a joke. Then, when she wanted to take it further, he hesitated. His hesitation might stem from fear of backlash, but he did take the time to think about it. However, the reason he gave for rejecting her is societal acceptance rather than personal feelings or incompatibility. \n\nIn many cultures, family and societal expectations play a huge role in relationships, especially in politically charged contexts. The author might be following the norm in his community, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right. The question is whether it's fair to reject someone based on their nationality before a real relationship can develop. \n\nOn the pro side: He's being honest about his values and the challenges they would face. It's not like he led her on or pretended to be interested. He communicated his concerns upfront.\n\nOn the con side: He might be allowing external pressures to dictate his personal choices, potentially missing out on a meaningful connection. Rejecting someone solely based on nationality could be seen as prejudiced, even if the conflict is complex. He's making a judgment based on their backgrounds rather than individual merits.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being truthful about his reasons. If he genuinely believes that societal pressures would prevent a successful relationship, then he's acting out of a place of concern for both their well-being. However, if he's using that as an excuse to avoid confrontation or personal growth, then it could be seen as avoiding responsibility.\n\nAnother point is that he's 17. At that age, people are still figuring out their values and how to navigate relationships. Maybe he's not fully aware of how his decision affects Maya, who might have different perspectives on the conflict. Maya's family's disapproval is also a factor, but the author is making a choice that aligns with his own community's expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is influenced by valid societal issues, rejecting someone based solely on nationality without giving a relationship a chance could be seen as inconsiderate. However, considering the real-world challenges they would face, some might argue it's a pragmatic choice. The ethical dilemma here is between personal choice and societal pressures. Depending on one's values, the answer could vary.\n"
