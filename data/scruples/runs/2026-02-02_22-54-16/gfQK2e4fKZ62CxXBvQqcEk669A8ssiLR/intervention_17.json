I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, moved to the USA recently. He met a group, including an Israeli girl, became friends, had some one-on-one time, and then rejected her when she wanted to date because of societal pressures and political tensions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and political contexts. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a very sensitive and complex issue. The author is concerned about societal acceptance and family reactions. He mentioned that he values the possibility of marriage, which requires mutual acceptance. \n\nThe author explains that he's Palestinian and Jordanian, and Maya is Israeli. Their relationship would face opposition from both sides due to the historical enmity. He's considering not just his own feelings but also the reality of their families and communities. \n\nIs it fair to reject someone based on their nationality? Well, the author isn't rejecting her just because she's Israeli, but because of the societal and familial pressures that would affect their potential relationship. He's being honest about his own limitations and the external factors that could prevent a future together. \n\nIn many cultures, family and societal approval are significant factors in relationships. The author is upfront about his stance, which might be seen as responsible. However, some might argue that he's letting external factors override personal feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHe didn't lead her on; he considered the situation and made a choice based on realistic challenges. Maya might have felt rejected, but the author isn't hiding his reasons. It's a tough situation, but he's being truthful. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acknowledging the real-world obstacles and being honest about his inability to proceed.\n"
