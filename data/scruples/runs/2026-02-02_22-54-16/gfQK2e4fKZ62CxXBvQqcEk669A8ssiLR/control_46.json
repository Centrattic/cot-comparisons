I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the USA who rejected an Israeli girl he was hanging out with, citing societal issues and national tensions. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, moved to the US recently, met a group including Maya from Israel. They hung out, had fun, did some \"fake\" dates like Valentine's. The author felt the societal pressure and family disapproval due to the conflict between Palestine and Israel, so he decided not to pursue a real relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, the author is ending a potential relationship based on political tensions and family expectations. That could be seen as unfair because personal relationships shouldn't be dictated by national conflicts. Maya's nationality isn't her fault, and the author might be letting external factors affect his personal life. Also, at 17, he's still young, and his views might evolve as he grows older.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings and the challenges they'd face. He's not leading her on; he's upfront about his inability to commit due to external pressures. Society and family disapproval are real issues in such situations. He might genuinely believe that the relationship isn't viable long-term, given the societal context.\n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize societal and familial expectations over personal happiness? Many would argue that personal relationships should be based on mutual respect and affection, not external factors. The fact that he was willing to give Maya a chance initially shows he was open, but ultimately, his environment's influence led him to back out. That could be seen as a cop-out, avoiding responsibility for the relationship's success.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others would judge him for dating an Israeli girl, which adds pressure. But does that make it his fault? He's facing real-world pressures, but that doesn't justify not trying to build a relationship based on personal feelings. The decision is his to make, but the question is whether it's morally wrong.\n\nThere's also the aspect of his own sensitivity to Palestine. He might feel that dating someone from Israel betrays his identity or his people's cause. However, individual relationships shouldn't be a political statement. The girl isn't responsible for the actions of her government or her country's policies. So, the author's decision might be more about the national conflict than Maya as a person.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is being honest about his feelings and the challenges, the decision to reject Maya based on her nationality could be seen as inconsiderate. It's about whether personal feelings and societal pressures should override a potential relationship. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's making a hard choice based on real-life circumstances, but others might argue that he's letting external factors dictate his personal life. The key is that he's not leading her on but is upfront. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here."
