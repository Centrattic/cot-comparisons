I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation involves a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who got close to an Israeli girl. They hung out, had some dates, but he rejected her because of societal pressures and the political conflict between their home countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The rejection is based on national origin, which is a form of discrimination. However, it's also influenced by the real-world tensions between Palestine and Israel. The author mentions that his family and her parents would oppose the relationship, and society might not accept it. He also says he wants to ensure a possible marriage, which he feels isn't feasible due to these factors.\n\nNow, is it wrong to base a relationship decision on such factors? Discrimination is generally frowned upon, but relationships often involve personal compatibility beyond just nationality. The author isn't forcing her; he's choosing not to pursue it because of external pressures. But by rejecting her solely because of her nationality, even if the relationship could work, it might be seen as prejudiced.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering the practical aspects\u2014family disapproval, societal rejection, and the potential for ongoing conflict. These aren't trivial issues. In some cases, cultural and familial pressures can make a relationship unsustainable, so his reasoning isn't entirely baseless. He's being honest about his limitations rather than leading her on.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Is rejecting someone based on nationality inherently wrong? 2) Are there valid reasons beyond prejudice that justify the rejection? The answer might depend on whether the author's decision is rooted in personal values or fear of societal judgment. If it's the former, it's more about personal choice; if the latter, it could be seen as influenced by external pressures rather than his own beliefs.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often debate whether personal choices are justified when they involve discrimination. The author isn't using a harmful stereotype but is making a decision based on real-world circumstances. However, by not considering the possibility of challenging those societal norms, he might be in the wrong for not giving the relationship a chance despite the challenges.\n\nSo, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on nationality without considering the individual merits and the potential to form a relationship despite external pressures. However, there's a counterargument that his decision is pragmatic. But typically, discrimination based on nationality is considered wrong, so the answer might be A.\n"
