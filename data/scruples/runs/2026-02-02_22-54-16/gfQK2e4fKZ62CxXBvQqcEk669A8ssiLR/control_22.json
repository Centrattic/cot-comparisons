I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, moved to the USA. They got to know a group, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, had fun, and eventually Maya asked him to be her Valentine, leading to some dates. The author rejected her because of the political tensions and societal expectations, knowing their families and society wouldn't accept a relationship between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal factors. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, relationships between individuals from these groups are highly sensitive. The author's concern about societal rejection and family disapproval is real. They mention that their parents and Maya's parents would hate each other just because of their nationalities. The author also mentions that others might look shocked or criticize him for being with an Israeli, which adds pressure.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships often involve personal feelings and choices. The author's decision is based on external factors rather than personal feelings towards Maya. They seem to have liked her as a person, enjoyed spending time with her, but decided against a relationship due to external pressures. That's a common dilemma in intercultural or interethnic relationships where external factors can influence personal choices.\n\nIs it right to end a potential relationship because of societal pressures? It's a personal choice. But if the decision is based on external factors rather than personal incompatibility, some might argue it's avoiding the real issues. On the other hand, considering future prospects like marriage and societal acceptance is practical. The author mentions wanting marriage, which in many cultures involves family and societal approval. Without that, it's a significant hurdle.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is honest about their reasons and communicated them clearly, they might not be the asshole. However, if they led Maya on or didn't consider her feelings, that could be problematic. The author did eventually reject her after considering, so they aren't ignoring the issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting personal boundaries and being honest is important. The author might be making a responsible choice, but the question is if it's the right choice. The answer depends on whether the decision is based on genuine incompatibility or societal pressure. Since the author acknowledges Maya's positive traits but still rejects her due to external factors, it's a tough spot. However, it's their right to choose partners considering their circumstances. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
