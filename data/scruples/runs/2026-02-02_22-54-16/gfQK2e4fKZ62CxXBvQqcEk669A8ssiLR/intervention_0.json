I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian boy with Jordanian nationality who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including a girl named Maya from Israel. They hung out, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine. They had some fun, but when she asked for a real date, he rejected her because of the political situation between their countries. He's worried about societal rejection and his family's disapproval, so he doesn't think a relationship could work.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasoning. He mentions that he wants to date someone with the potential for marriage, and he's concerned about societal acceptance. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a real and long-standing issue, so it's possible that their families and communities might indeed disapprove. At 17, he's still young and forming his views, so his priorities here might be influenced by his environment and upbringing.\n\nBut then, is it right to reject someone based on their nationality? That's a tricky question. On one hand, making a relationship decision based on national origin can be seen as discriminatory. However, the user is considering the practical and social realities of their situation. If both families are opposed, and the society is hostile, it's understandable that he might not want to pursue a relationship that could lead to significant personal and familial conflict. \n\nI should also think about Maya's perspective. She was open and asked him as a joke initially, then wanted to go further. He gave her a chance and then explained his reasons. He didn't hide his feelings and was honest, which is important. So, was he being fair? He's making a choice based on his own values and the potential consequences. \n\nThe question is whether this makes him an asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is subjective, but the key is whether his actions were unjustified. If the rejection was based on prejudice, then yes. But if it's based on a realistic assessment of their circumstances and potential for a future together, then maybe not. \n\nAge is another factor. At 17, people are still figuring things out, and his views might change as he grows older. Also, the conflict between Palestine and Israel is complex, and personal relationships can be challenging in such contexts. \n\nI need to weigh the personal choice against societal norms and personal values. The user isn't just rejecting Maya; he's considering the broader implications. So, while it's a personal choice, is it wrong? It's a matter of perspective. Some might argue that love should transcend national boundaries, but others would agree that practical realities matter. \n\nIn conclusion, the user is making a decision based on his understanding of their situation. He's not being disrespectful to Maya, but he's prioritizing his own and his family's acceptance. Whether that's right or wrong depends on the values one applies. However, since he's explaining his reasoning honestly and without malice, it's more a matter of personal ethics than being in the wrong.\n"
