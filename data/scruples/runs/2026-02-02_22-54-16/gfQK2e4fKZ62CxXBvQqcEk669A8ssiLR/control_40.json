I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the US. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through mutual friends. They hung out, and she asked to be his Valentine in a joke. They had some one-on-one time, and she wanted to take it to a date. The author rejected her because he's concerned about societal acceptance and family reactions. He's worried about the political tensions between Israelis and Palestinians affecting their potential relationship.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's decision is based on external pressures rather than personal feelings. He mentions that his and her families disapprove, and society might look down on their relationship. However, he also acknowledges that Maya is a good person and that they had fun together. \n\nThe key points here are whether it's fair to reject someone based on societal expectations rather than personal compatibility, and whether the author is justified in his decision given the political context. On one hand, everyone has the right to their preferences and considerations, especially when it comes to long-term commitments like marriage. On the other hand, turning someone down solely because of national identity without addressing the possibility of personal connection could be seen as prejudiced.\n\nBut the author isn't outrightly bigoted; he's considering the real-world implications. The question is if he's in the wrong for being honest about his concerns. Since he's young and the relationship hadn't reached a point where they discussed serious commitment, his decision might be seen as reasonable. However, some might argue that he's letting external factors dictate his personal choices.\n\nI think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on his values and the reality he's aware of. He's not acting out of hate but out of concern for societal and familial pressures, which are valid factors for someone his age to consider.\n"
