I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who recently moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They spent time together, and Maya made a move to be his Valentine, leading to some one-on-one interactions. However, when she asked for a real date, he rejected her because of societal pressures and the conflict between their countries. He mentions that their families would disapprove, and he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To answer A or B, I need to consider several factors. \n\nFrom one perspective, the author is being honest about his feelings and the challenges they'd face due to the political and social tensions between Palestine and Israel. He's aware that their relationship would face significant opposition, which might make a long-term commitment difficult. This could be seen as being realistic and responsible, as he's considering future implications and societal acceptance. In that case, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's unfair to reject someone based on their nationality, especially since Maya is an individual with her own personality and values. The author acknowledges that Maya is a nice person, so some could see his rejection as prejudiced or influenced by external factors rather than the person herself. This perspective would lean towards A (in the wrong), as he's making a decision based on national identity rather than personal connection.\n\nBut the author also mentions that he wanted to ensure the relationship could lead to marriage. If societal and familial disapproval would make such a marriage impossible, then his decision might be based on practical considerations rather than just prejudice. It's a complex issue, as it's not just about personal feelings but also the real-world consequences of such a relationship in their current environment.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. At 17, the author might not have fully considered that his views or societal norms could change over time. However, he's making a decision based on his current beliefs and circumstances. The question is whether it's acceptable to prioritize societal expectations over a personal relationship.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the context. If the author's decision is based on genuine concerns about the future and not just prejudice against Maya as an individual, some might side with B. However, if the rejection is because of her nationality without considering their compatibility beyond that, then A could be the case.\n\nI also need to think about cultural and political sensitivities. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a real and ongoing issue, and families' reactions can be intense. The author is upfront about this, which shows he's not hiding his reasons. That might mitigate some criticism because he's being honest about his stance.\n\nIn summary, the answer might depend on whether the rejection is based on justified societal concerns or on prejudice against Maya's nationality. The author seems to have considered both his feelings and the external factors. Since he was open with Maya and didn't lead her on, it's possible that the community would see his actions as not being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
