I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who met an Israeli girl named Maya. They became friends, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They hung out a few times, and when she wanted a real date, he rejected her because of their nationalities and societal expectations. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. He said he wants to marry someone if they're compatible, but societal pressures and his family's disapproval are factors. His rejection is based on the conflict between their countries, which is a real issue. But is that a valid reason to reject someone he was dating? \n\nOn one hand, his feelings about the political situation are valid. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is complex and deeply personal for many. His concern about societal acceptance and family reactions is understandable. He's not in the wrong for having these beliefs, especially coming from a place where this conflict affects daily life.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya was trying to connect with him, and he ended things because of her nationality, not her character. That could be seen as prejudiced, even if it's influenced by real-world tensions. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's honest about his reasons and isn't forcing her, it's more about personal values and circumstances.\n\nAlso, he's 17, so his views might evolve. The key point is that he's not being malicious but is making a decision based on his upbringing and societal pressures. So, the answer might be B (not the asshole) because he's acting on his beliefs without malice, even if others might disagree.\n"
