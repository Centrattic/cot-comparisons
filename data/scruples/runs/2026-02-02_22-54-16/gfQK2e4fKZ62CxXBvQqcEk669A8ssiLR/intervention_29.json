I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation involves a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who got close to an Israeli girl, and he rejected her because of societal and family expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his family and hers would hate the relationship because of the political situation between Palestine and Israel. He also says he wants to ensure a possible future marriage, which implies he's thinking long-term. He didn't just reject her on the spot; he gave it some thought and considered their societal pressures. \n\nThe girl, Maya, initiated the relationship attempts, starting with a joke Valentine's offer and progressing to one-on-one hangouts. The author felt pressured by his community's reaction and his own values. The key point here is whether rejecting someone based on their nationality is inherently wrong, even if it's due to external factors like family and societal acceptance.\n\nOn one hand, people should be free to choose their partners without national or political biases. But on the other hand, the author is making an honest assessment of the feasibility of a relationship given the hostile environment from both sides. He's being upfront about his reasons, which shows he's not hiding his motivations. \n\nAlso, the author isn't saying he doesn't like her; he acknowledges she's a good person. The rejection is based on external factors beyond their control. However, some might argue that he's letting external pressures dictate a personal choice that he should be free to make. \n\nBut in this case, the author isn't just avoiding something because of prejudice. He's considering the real-life consequences\u2014family disapproval, societal rejection, and the impossibility of marriage if families and society won't accept it. It's a realistic assessment of the situation's viability, not just personal dislike. \n\nSo, taking all that into account, the author is making a decision based on practical considerations and honest communication. Therefore, he might not be the asshole, as he's being truthful and considering the realities of their situation.\n"
