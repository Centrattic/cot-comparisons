I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user's question is whether rejecting someone because of their nationality, especially in a politically sensitive context like Israel and Palestine, is the wrong thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 17-year-old from Palestine (Jordanian citizen) who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he did as a joke. They had some fun interactions, but when she wanted an actual date, he hesitated and eventually rejected her because of the political tensions between their countries. He's worried about societal backlash and his families' disapproval.\n\nNow, considering the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is a deeply sensitive and complex issue. People from these regions often face significant societal and familial pressures when considering relationships across the divide. The author is being honest about his concerns, which are real and rooted in the conflict's reality. He's also young, 17, so his perspective might be influenced by the environment he's grown up in, where such relationships are frowned upon or even seen as betrayal.\n\nBut wait, is rejecting someone based on nationality inherently wrong? In general, discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity is considered wrong in many societies. However, this case is different because it's not just about personal prejudice but about real-world consequences like family rejection, social stigma, and possibly even safety concerns. The author is not making a decision based on personal dislike but on the societal context he's aware of.\n\nAlso, the author is clear that he didn't act out of prejudice but out of practical considerations. He mentions that others would look shocked and call him a traitor. This suggests that the decision isn't just his own but influenced by external pressures. At the same time, Maya is Israeli, and her family might also have their own views on relationships with Palestinians. So both sides face societal expectations.\n\nHowever, there's a line between making a decision based on real-world factors and making a decision based on prejudice. The author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of the political context, not because of Maya's character. He even acknowledges that she's nice and fun to be with. So maybe his decision isn't about her being Israeli but about the consequences of their relationship in their respective societies.\n\nBut is it the right choice? From a personal ethics standpoint, some might argue that love should transcend political issues, and avoiding a relationship because of nationality is a form of discrimination. However, considering the reality of the situation, where such relationships can lead to significant personal and familial conflict, the author is weighing in on the practical aspects.\n\nThe question is whether he is in the wrong. If we look at it from a moral standpoint that values individual choice and the idea that people should be allowed to love whom they want regardless of political issues, then the author might be seen as in the wrong. On the other hand, if we consider the reality of the situation and the pressures he's under, his decision could be seen as a realistic choice given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, since he's 17, his views might not be fully formed. Maybe as he grows and experiences more, his perspective could change. But at his age, societal influences are strong, especially in a conflict zone.\n\nAnother angle: Maya was from Israel, but she was making the first moves. She wanted to date him, and he rejected her. In a personal relationship, honesty is key. He was upfront about his reasons, which shows respect towards her. However, if he had pursued the relationship without considering the implications, there might have been more complications later.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, rejecting someone based on their nationality is generally discouraged. On the other, the context here is unique. It's not just about personal prejudice but about real societal pressures. The author might be in the right if he's making an honest decision based on his values and circumstances, even if those values are influenced by external factors. Alternatively, he might be seen as in the wrong for not taking the chance on a relationship despite the challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the complex geopolitical context and the real-world implications, the author's decision is influenced by factors beyond just personal choice. While it's not ideal to reject someone based on nationality, the context here is different. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's a valid argument for A as well.\n"
