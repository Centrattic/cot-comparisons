I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities.\n\nFirst, the author is from Palestine with Jordanian nationality and moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They started hanging out, had some fake Valentine's dates, and he eventually rejected her because of the political tensions between their countries. He mentions societal pressures and family disapproval if they were to date or marry.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider different angles. On one hand, rejecting someone based on their nationality might be seen as discriminatory. Love and relationships are personal, and societal issues shouldn't necessarily dictate personal choices. But on the other hand, the author is also considering the real-world implications, like family and societal acceptance. He might feel that pursuing a relationship would lead to too much conflict or that the relationship isn't viable long-term because of the political context.\n\nHowever, just because of national tensions doesn't mean the two can't have a relationship. People in real life do form relationships across such divides, and it's a personal choice. By rejecting her solely based on nationality, he's making a decision that might not be fair to Maya, who is an individual. The author might be projecting his own fears onto the situation rather than giving the relationship a chance.\n\nBut then again, if the author is certain that the societal pressures would make the relationship impossible, maybe he's being realistic. But it's still a choice to prioritize that over the potential relationship. So, depending on the perspective, some might say he's in the wrong for not giving the relationship a chance, while others might understand his position due to the context.\n\nI think the key point here is whether rejecting someone based on their nationality is justified. Since the author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of where she's from, that could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the circumstances are complicated, the decision is based on her nationality rather than her as a person. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong). But there's nuance here. If the author truly believes that the societal pressures would be insurmountable and he's not willing to face that, it's his choice. But the question is whether it's the right choice. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to let nationality or political issues dictate romantic choices, unless there's a direct risk or harm. Since the author is not in a position where his safety or well-being is at risk, just societal disapproval, it might be considered wrong to reject someone for that reason. So leaning towards A.\n"
