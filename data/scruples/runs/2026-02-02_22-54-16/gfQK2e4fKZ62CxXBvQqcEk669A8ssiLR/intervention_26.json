I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian (Jordanian nationality) in the US. They had a friendly group including Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, but he rejected her because he doesn't think the relationship could work due to the conflict between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and political context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a long-standing issue with deep-seated tensions. The author mentions that his family and her family would hate each other, and society wouldn't accept the relationship. So he's rejecting her based on external pressures and his own feelings about the conflict.\n\nHe also says he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, so he's being pragmatic about long-term compatibility. But is that a valid reason? Well, he's 17, so he might not be in a position to make a lifelong commitment decision yet. However, his reasoning is based on real-world challenges. But then again, is it fair to Maya? She might be willing to work through those issues, but he's choosing not to even try because of societal expectations.\n\nOn one hand, he's honest about his feelings and the challenges they'd face. On the other, he's letting societal norms dictate his personal choices. But he didn't lead her on; he rejected her after considering the issues. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I should see if that's justified.\n\nIs it wrong to base a relationship decision on the geopolitical situation? Some might argue that love should transcend borders, but others see the practical implications. The author isn't being cruel; he's being realistic about the challenges. So maybe not in the wrong. But also, is he avoiding the problem? Maybe, but he's being honest. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
