I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian-Jordanian in the USA, and he's rejecting the Israeli girl due to societal and political tensions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue is the political conflict between Palestine and Israel. The author mentions that both families would hate the relationship, and society wouldn't accept it. He also says he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, which requires societal acceptance.\n\nFrom his perspective, he's making a decision based on real-world challenges. He's young, 17, and might not be in a position to handle the societal backlash. He's also considering practical aspects like family approval and future commitment. But is it fair to reject someone solely based on their nationality?\n\nOn the other hand, the girl from Israel might feel hurt that her nationality is the main reason for rejection. She's an individual, not defined by her country. The author's choice could be seen as prejudiced, even if it's due to external pressures. But he's also being realistic about the challenges they'd face.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's a tough call. He's honest about his reasons and not pretending it's about her personality. However, rejecting someone based on their nationality can be seen as discriminatory, even if there's a cultural or political context. The fact that he connected with her and enjoyed time together might make the rejection harder for her to accept.\n\nBut given the real-world implications and his personal boundaries, maybe he's just being practical. The question is whether the wrong is in the rejection itself or in the societal pressures. The author isn't forcing the relationship; he's acknowledging the impossibility given their circumstances. \n\nSo, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's acting on genuine concerns, but others might argue that he should be open-minded. I think the answer hinges on whether the rejection is based on her identity versus mutual compatibility. Since he's rejecting based on nationality, which is a big factor, it's a gray area. However, considering the societal context and his own reasoning, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
