I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting Maya because she's from Israel. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality living in the USA. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through a group of friends. They became close, had some fun interactions, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine, which they treated as a joke. They hung out a few times, and she eventually asked for an actual date. He said he needed time to think but ended up rejecting her because of societal pressures and the political conflict between their countries.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons for his rejection. He mentions that their families and society would not accept a relationship between a Palestinian man and an Israeli woman. He also says he wants to ensure marriage is possible if they're in love, implying that societal acceptance is a factor in his decision. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The question is whether rejecting someone based on nationality due to political tensions is justified. On one hand, he's making a choice based on his values and the potential societal backlash he's aware of. On the other hand, Maya is an individual, not a political symbol. He might be generalizing the conflict to her personally, which could be unfair. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. In terms of ethical considerations, choosing not to date someone due to national identity ties into real-world tensions. It's a personal decision influenced by cultural and political contexts. But from a moral standpoint, some might argue that he should prioritize his feelings and Maya's worth as a person over external factors. \n\nBut the author is 17, still young, and making decisions that consider future implications like family and societal acceptance. It's possible he's being realistic about the challenges they'd face. However, the rejection is based on her nationality rather than her character. \n\nIn many similar scenarios, people are criticized for rejecting others based on factors like race, religion, or nationality unless it's a matter of incompatibility beyond identity. Since the conflict between Palestine and Israel is deeply rooted, societal acceptance is a significant barrier. But Maya is an individual who might not share the same views as the broader political conflict. \n\nThe author might be acting in self-preservation, considering the potential backlash from both families and society. However, he could also be avoiding a relationship because of external pressures rather than personal compatibility. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the decision is based on prejudice against her nationality, then yes. If it's a realistic assessment of societal challenges and future viability of a relationship, then no. Given that he's aware of the political context and the potential impact on his family and himself, it's a complex situation where he's making a personal choice influenced by external factors. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for criticism about how he handled it, especially considering Maya's individuality.\n"
