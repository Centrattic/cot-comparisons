I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for rejecting a girl because she's from Israel, given their nationalities (Palestinian and Israeli). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, Jordanian national living in the USA. The girl, Maya, is Israeli. They became friends, spent time together, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which started as a joke but led to more one-on-one time. The author considered dating her but ultimately rejected her due to societal and familial expectations about the Israel-Palestine conflict. The main reason he gives is that their families and society would not accept a Palestinian man dating or marrying an Israeli woman, so he didn't want to proceed.\n\nNow, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nThis involves a few angles. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on potential social and familial backlash. He believes that their cultural and political backgrounds make a relationship unsustainable. On the other hand, choosing a partner based on nationality could be seen as prejudiced, especially if there's no personal animosity between him and Maya herself. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is it fair to reject someone based on their nationality? 2) Is the author being influenced by societal pressures rather than personal feelings? 3) Are there other factors that could be considered, like Maya's personal views on the conflict?\n\nThe author mentions that he gave Maya a chance initially because she was the first Israeli he met, and he found her nice and fun. However, when considering a real date, he backed out due to societal pressures. This might indicate that while he liked her as a person, the conflict between their nationalities made him hesitant. \n\nIn some contexts, making decisions based on such complex geopolitical issues can be seen as valid, especially if the person is aware of the potential consequences. However, if the author is prioritizing societal opinions over his own feelings and the possibility of a relationship, that could be criticized. \n\nBut the situation is complicated by the real-world tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Marrying or dating someone from the \"other side\" can lead to significant family and social repercussions. The author is being honest about the challenges they would face. \n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girl was willing to pursue a relationship despite the challenges, and the author is turning her down solely because of her nationality without considering their personal compatibility beyond that, then it might be seen as wrong. But if he's considering the real-world feasibility of a relationship due to external pressures, that's a more nuanced case.\n\nThe author also mentions that his parents and her parents would hate each other, which adds a layer of family pressure. At 17, he's still young, and his perspective might be heavily influenced by the conflict's societal impact. \n\nUltimately, this is a moral and ethical question. There's no clear right or wrong answer, but from a typical perspective, people might argue that rejecting someone based on nationality is discriminatory. However, given the specific historical and political context, some might understand the author's decision as a realistic assessment of the situation. \n\nBut the general principle is that rejecting someone for reasons like nationality, unless there's a genuine incompatibility, is usually seen as a problem. Since the author liked her and they were getting along, his decision to reject her solely due to nationality and potential family/social issues could be seen as being in the wrong, as it's based on external factors rather than personal choice and mutual compatibility.\n"
