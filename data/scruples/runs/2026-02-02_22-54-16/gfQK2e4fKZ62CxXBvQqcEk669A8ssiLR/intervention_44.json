I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl because she's from Israel. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, but he rejected her because of their nationalities and the societal issues surrounding a relationship between a Palestinian and an Israeli. The parents of both sides hate the idea, and he's concerned about societal acceptance and future marriage possibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's decision is based on the political and social tensions between Palestine and Israel. It's a sensitive issue, and relationships between people from these regions can face significant societal opposition. The author mentions that he values the possibility of marriage and societal acceptance, which are important factors in some cultures.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's making a choice based on his personal beliefs and the reality of the situation. On the other hand, some might argue that he's letting political tensions affect a personal relationship, potentially missing out on a meaningful connection. The author isn't dismissing Maya's feelings outright but is being honest about the challenges. He also gave her a chance and engaged with her before deciding. \n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize societal and cultural factors over a romantic interest? In some contexts, people might see this as a pragmatic choice, especially given the age of the individuals and their current life situations (being in school, dealing with family expectations). However, others might argue that it's unfair to Maya, who might be open to the relationship despite the challenges. The author's reasoning is that societal acceptance is crucial for a lasting relationship, which could be a valid concern if both parties are considering marriage and family in the future.\n\nI should also consider the age factor. At 17, the author is still young, and his perspectives might evolve. The decision to reject her based on nationality might be seen as a reflection of current societal pressures rather than personal readiness. However, the decision seems thoughtful, considering the long-term implications. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the focus is on respecting personal feelings and the potential for a relationship despite challenges, then A (in the wrong) might be the answer. If the focus is on the practicality of societal and cultural factors, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the author made a decision based on his own values and the societal context, it's a complex situation. The answer likely leans towards B, as he's being honest and considering long-term aspects, even if it's a difficult choice.\n"
