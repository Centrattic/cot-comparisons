I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. The person, an 17-year-old Jordanian national from Palestine living in the USA, rejected a girl named Maya from Israel because of their national backgrounds. They had a friendly relationship, maybe even some dates, but he decided against a real relationship due to societal and familial pressures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is deep-rooted and affects personal relationships. The user mentions that his parents and Maya's parents would disapprove, and society might look down on their relationship. So, the rejection isn't just personal but involves broader societal issues.\n\nHe says he's looking for a potential marriage, which implies he's considering long-term commitment. His reasons are based on the societal norms and family expectations. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? Well, in terms of personal choice, he's within his rights to decide who he wants to be in a relationship with. However, if the rejection is solely based on nationality without considering the individual, that could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is young and maybe not fully aware of the complexities of intercultural relationships. He might be influenced by his environment and family. The question is whether he's being fair to Maya. She's an individual, and the user is making a decision based on her nationality rather than personal qualities. \n\nBut the user also mentions that his community's reaction is a factor. That's a real concern, especially in a place where such relationships are stigmatized. However, the user could have explored ways to navigate those challenges instead of immediately rejecting her. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's subjective. If he's honest about his reasons and respects her, it might not be inconsiderate. But if he's leading her on or not being transparent, that's different. The story says he gave her a chance, so maybe he's being honest. \n\nI think the key here is whether the rejection is based on valid personal values or just societal pressure. The user might not be wrong if he's prioritizing his cultural and family values, but some might argue that it's limiting his personal freedom. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be nuanced. However, given the context of real-world pressures and the user's age, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
