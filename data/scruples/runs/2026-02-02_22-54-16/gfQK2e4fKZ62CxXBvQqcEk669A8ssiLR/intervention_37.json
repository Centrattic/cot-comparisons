I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he rejected a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. He's Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. They met at school, became friends, and she was interested in dating him. But he turned her down because he doesn't think society would accept a relationship between them due to the conflict between Palestine and Israel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal factors. In some cultures, relationships between people from conflicting regions are strongly discouraged or even seen as taboo. The author mentions that both their families would hate each other, and people around him might look down on him. He also says he wants to marry someone if things go well, so he's setting a high standard here. But does that justify rejecting her? \n\nOn the other hand, the girl is Israeli, and the author is Palestinian. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a significant political and social issue. People might have strong feelings about relationships between individuals from these regions. The author is aware of the potential backlash and the societal pressure. But is it fair to reject someone solely based on nationality?\n\nThe girl initiated a couple of fake dates, and the author felt closer to her. He didn't pursue a real date because of societal expectations. But is it his right to make that decision? He's under 18, so maybe there's also the aspect of being young and not fully formed opinions. \n\nIn some perspectives, making a choice based on where someone is from could be seen as prejudiced. However, the author is making a choice to avoid potential conflict and ensure that any future relationship has a chance without societal opposition. The question is whether his reasoning is valid. \n\nHe's honest about his reasons and didn't lead her on. He told her he needed to think and eventually rejected her with the reason being societal acceptance. So he's being upfront. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a complex situation. If someone is making a decision based on their cultural background and the potential for acceptance, it's a personal choice. But some might argue that choosing someone based on nationality is discriminatory. However, given the context of the ongoing conflict, it's not just about personal preference but also about the real-world implications and family reactions. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is based on personal values versus harmful prejudice. If he's making an informed choice considering his circumstances, some might say he's not in the wrong. Others might think that he should be open-minded and not let politics interfere with personal feelings. \n\nSince the question is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on these factors. Considering that he's young, the cultural context, and his reasoning, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a counterargument. However, the main point is that he's making a choice based on his beliefs and the reality of the situation as he sees it.\n"
