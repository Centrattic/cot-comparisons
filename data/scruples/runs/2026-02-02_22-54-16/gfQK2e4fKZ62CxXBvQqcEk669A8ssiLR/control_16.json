I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the USA who rejected a girl from Israel because of their nationalities and the political tensions between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal factors. In many parts of the Middle East, relationships between Israelis and Palestinians are extremely sensitive due to the long-standing conflict. The author mentions that his community and the girl's parents would not accept such a relationship. He also says he wants relationships where marriage is a possibility, and he believes societal pressures would prevent that here.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl, Maya, seems to have made an effort to connect, and they had a good time together. The author rejected her not because of her personality but because of her nationality, which is a form of discrimination based on national origin. That's a key point. Even if the societal context is challenging, choosing a partner based solely on their country of origin might be seen as unfair to the individual.\n\nHowever, the author is young and might be influenced by his environment and upbringing. He might genuinely believe that such a relationship is impossible due to the conflict and family expectations. But is that a valid reason? Well, personal choice and autonomy are important. The author has the right to make decisions based on his values, but rejecting someone solely because of their nationality without considering the individual's character could be seen as prejudiced.\n\nIn terms of the question of being an \"asshole,\" it's about whether he acted unkindly or unfairly. He did consider giving her a chance initially but decided against it later due to external pressures. Maybe he could have communicated better or been more honest from the start. However, the fact that he acknowledged their incompatibility due to societal issues might be seen as trying to be respectful rather than just being mean.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the decision is based on national identity which can be discriminatory, but the context of deep-seated conflict is real. The answer might depend on whether prioritizing national affiliation over individual worth is considered wrong. In many social contexts, personal choice is respected, but systemic issues like conflict can complicate things. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and in terms of general principles of fairness and individual merit, rejecting someone based on nationality is typically considered wrong. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
