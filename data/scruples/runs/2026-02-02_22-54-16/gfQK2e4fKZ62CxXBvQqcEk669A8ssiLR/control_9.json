I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy who moved to the US. He met a group of people, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They started hanging out, and eventually, she asked him to be her Valentine, which he did as a joke. Then they had some one-on-one time, and she wanted to take it further. But he rejected her because of the political situation between their countries and societal expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. He mentioned that he's Palestinian and from a sensitive background. His rejection is based on the conflict between Palestine and Israel. He's worried about societal acceptance and his parents' disapproval. On the other hand, Maya is Israeli, and their families hate each other because of the conflict.\n\nIs it wrong to reject someone because of their nationality or political background? Well, people have the right to make personal choices based on their values and beliefs. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a real and complex issue with deep-rooted historical and political tensions. Many people from both sides hold strong views that can affect personal relationships. \n\nHowever, choosing a partner based on nationality could be seen as prejudiced, especially if the person is an individual and not just a national. But given the specific context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it's a sensitive area. The author is also young, 17, so his views might be influenced by the environment and his upbringing. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at it from a personal choice perspective, he's not obligated to be in a relationship if he doesn't believe it's feasible due to external pressures. But if we consider that he ended things because of her nationality without considering her as an individual, that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by the real-world implications. In his case, the societal and familial opposition is significant. He might be prioritizing his own comfort and future (like marriage) over the relationship. It's possible that he's making a pragmatic decision, even if it's painful for Maya.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's standing by his beliefs and considering the reality of the conflict. On the other hand, he might be letting political tensions interfere with a personal connection. Since he's honest about his reasons and hasn't lied, maybe he's justified. But others might argue that love shouldn't be bound by nationality. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his values and circumstances.\n"
