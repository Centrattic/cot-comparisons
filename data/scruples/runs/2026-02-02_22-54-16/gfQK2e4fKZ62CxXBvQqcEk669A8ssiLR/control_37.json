I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The person is 17, from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, and they moved to the USA.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about rejecting someone based on their nationality due to the conflict between Palestine and Israel. The author mentions that their families and society would have a hard time accepting a relationship between them and an Israeli girl. They also talk about the societal pressure and how others might react negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Rejecting someone solely because of their nationality, especially in a context where there's a political conflict, is a sensitive issue. Personal relationships can be affected by external factors, but is it fair to reject someone based on something beyond their control?\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and the challenges they foresee. They might be worried about familial rejection, societal judgment, and the stress that comes with it. However, on the other hand, the girl's nationality is not her fault, and the author is making a decision based on factors that are more about the environment and less about the girl herself. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the rejection is based on the conflict and potential social consequences, it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong for considering these factors, especially if they genuinely believe they can't overcome the societal issues. But some might argue that personal relationships shouldn't be dictated by political tensions, so the author could be seen as avoiding responsibility or being discriminatory.\n\nThe girl was open and tried to get to know him, and the author acknowledged her positive traits. Yet, the decision was based on external pressures. So the answer might depend on the perspective: some might say it's understandable given the context, while others might say the author is letting external factors influence his personal choices unfairly.\n"
