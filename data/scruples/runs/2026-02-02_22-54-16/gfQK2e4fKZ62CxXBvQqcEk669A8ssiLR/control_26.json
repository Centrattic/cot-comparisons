I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation is complicated by the political tensions between Palestine and Israel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. The girl is Israeli. They started hanging out as friends, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which they did as a joke. Then she wanted to take it further, but he rejected her because of societal pressures and the fact that their families would disapprove. He's concerned about future marriage and societal acceptance.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and the reasons behind the rejection. The author didn't act out of malice but based on cultural and political reasons. However, it's important to note that the girl from Israel is part of a group that the author's community might view as an enemy. The author is prioritizing his own values and societal expectations over the relationship, which can be seen as ethnocentric or politically motivated.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Is it wrong to prioritize one's cultural and national identity? Or is it about personal choice in relationships? In many cases, people choose partners based on shared values, religion, culture, etc. However, this situation adds a layer of political conflict. The author is not being discriminatory per se but is making a decision based on external pressures and his own beliefs about what's acceptable in his community.\n\nBut is it the right decision? If the girl is open to the relationship and the author is rejecting her not out of personal dislike but societal reasons, does that make him the asshole? It's a nuanced situation. On one hand, he's being honest about his inability to commit due to external factors. On the other, he might be letting external pressures dictate his personal choices, which could be seen as not taking responsibility for his own happiness or the potential relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were in the early stages of \"fake\" dates and not a real relationship might affect the judgment. Maybe the author didn't give it a real chance, but that's part of his reasoning. The question is whether the rejection is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on his personal values and societal expectations. Whether that makes him wrong depends on perspective. If the community's pressures are so strong that he can't see a future with her, then his decision is understandable. But if he's avoiding a potential meaningful relationship because of external factors rather than personal incompatibility, that could be seen as a problem. However, given the context, many might argue that he's being realistic. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where it's not entirely his fault but also not entirely justified.\n"
