I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, moved to the USA. He formed a connection with an Israeli girl, Maya, but ultimately rejected her because of societal pressures and the political situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is a real and sensitive issue. The author's decision is based on the potential lack of acceptance from their families and society. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? \n\nOn one hand, societal pressure can be intense, and the author might be worried about family and community reactions. Also, he mentions that he's Palestinian and the girl is Israeli, which historically have been conflicting groups. Choosing a partner from the \"other side\" might lead to significant challenges, maybe even danger in some contexts. However, the author is in the USA now, so maybe the immediate conflict isn't as present here. But cultural and familial expectations could still be strong.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya initiated contact, and they had a good time. The author's reason for rejection is based on societal expectations rather than personal incompatibility. The question is whether that's fair. Love and relationships often require overcoming societal barriers. If the author is only considering the possibility of marriage if society accepts it, that might be prioritizing others' opinions over their own and Maya's.\n\nAlso, the author is 17, which is young. At that age, people are still developing their values and understanding of relationships. But the decision to reject based on nationality might be a reflection of ingrained beliefs from growing up in a conflict zone. It's not entirely his fault if he's internalized these views, but it's worth considering whether he's limiting his own happiness and Maya's based on factors that might not be entirely within his control.\n\nAnother angle: the author's rejection is not about Maya's personal qualities but her nationality. That could be seen as prejudicial. However, given the context, some might argue it's pragmatic. The problem here is the conflict between personal feelings and societal/communal expectations.\n\nIn some cultures, family and community acceptance are crucial. If the author believes that without their acceptance, a relationship wouldn't work, then his stance is understandable. But if he's choosing to avoid potential conflict in his life by not pursuing it, is that the right decision? It's a tough call.\n\nI think the key is whether the author is allowing external factors to dictate his personal choices. If he's making a choice based on fear of others' reactions rather than his own true feelings and willingness to face challenges, then he might be the asshole. However, if he genuinely believes that societal pressures would make any relationship impossible, then it's a difficult but understandable decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's letting societal pressures dictate his personal life and rejecting someone based on nationality, which could be seen as discriminatory. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the real-world implications and his age influencing his decision. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A since the rejection is based on identity rather than personal compatibility.\n"
