I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who rejected an Israeli girl named Maya after some initial interactions. He feels pressured by societal expectations from both sides, with their families and people around them disapproving of a relationship between them. He's asking if he's the asshole for rejecting her because of their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's a deeply sensitive and political issue with a lot of historical and emotional weight. The conflict has led to significant tension and animosity between the two groups. The user mentions that his community and Maya's parents would hate such a relationship, which isn't just hypothetical\u2014there are real instances where relationships across these lines face strong opposition.\n\nThe user is in a situation where he's still young, 17, and navigating his identity and relationships. He acknowledges that Maya is a nice person but feels that societal pressures make a relationship impossible. He also mentions that he values the possibility of marriage, which is a big factor for him. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and the societal constraints that make a relationship impractical. On the other hand, he might be letting external factors influence his personal choices rather than his own feelings towards Maya. The question is whether his decision is based on prejudice or realistic expectations of societal rejection.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. He's honest about his reasons, not hiding his stance.\n2. He's considering future implications (marriage, societal acceptance).\n3. The conflict's historical context makes such relationships challenging.\n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize societal expectations over personal feelings? If he truly believes that the societal pressure would make a relationship untenable and that neither he nor Maya can withstand the backlash, then his decision is based on practicality. However, if he's rejecting her solely because of her nationality without considering his own genuine feelings, that could be seen as prejudice.\n\nThe user also mentions that the dates were \"fake\" and that he wasn't sure about a real date yet. So maybe he's not entirely committed to the relationship, which complicates the judgment. But the core issue is whether his rejection is based on her nationality rather than personal incompatibility.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. The user is being honest, but he's also letting external factors influence his decision, which might not be entirely his fault given the context. However, it's possible he's internalizing the conflict's tensions, making it hard to separate politics from personal feelings. So, is he the asshole? It's not a straightforward yes or no. But considering his age and the societal pressures, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on realistic challenges rather than personal dislike.\n"
