I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting Maya because she's from Israel. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the US. He's 17, met Maya through friends, and they had some interactions. He considered the societal pressures and family reactions, which led him to reject her because he doesn't think a relationship would work due to the political conflict between their nations.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author's reasons are based on societal and familial pressures, not personal dislike of Maya. He acknowledges she's nice and they get along, but external factors make him think it's not feasible. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships often involve personal choices influenced by various factors. The author isn't discriminating based on her character but is making a decision based on potential future challenges. However, some might argue that he's letting external pressures affect a personal decision, which could be seen as unfair to Maya. Others might say he's being realistic about societal acceptance and future compatibility.\n\nBut given the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the societal tensions are real and significant. The author's decision isn't made lightly; he's considering the possibility of marriage and long-term stability. He also mentions that her parents and his parents are against it, which adds to the complexity. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his values and the reality he faces. He's honest about his reasons and isn't degrading Maya. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
