I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who rejected Maya is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main point is that the guy is from Palestine (Jordanian nationality) and Maya is from Israel. He rejected her because their societies would not accept a relationship between them. He mentions that if they dated, people would look shocked and call him a traitor, and their parents would hate each other. He also says he wants to marry someone, so he thinks it's not feasible. \n\nNow, considering cultural and societal issues. In some contexts, people might have strong feelings about relationships between individuals from conflicting regions. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for rejecting based on nationality. \n\nI need to check if there's a clear wrong here. The guy isn't doing anything illegal, but maybe it's a matter of personal choice. He's being honest about his feelings and the societal pressures. On the other hand, Maya might feel hurt because she was trying to pursue a relationship. But the guy was upfront about his values and the potential consequences. \n\nAlso, he did give her a chance, hung out with her, and then decided it wasn't feasible for a long-term commitment. He didn't lie or hide his background. So from a moral standpoint, is it his fault for prioritizing his cultural/societal views? Some might argue that he's being realistic, while others might say he's letting external pressures affect his personal decisions. \n\nBut the question is whether he's the asshole. The key here is whether he's violating any moral standards. If he's being honest and making a choice based on his values, even if those values are influenced by societal norms, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's being prejudiced without personal experience, that's different. But in this case, he's aware of the societal issues from the start and considered the implications. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because he's making a personal choice based on his circumstances and values, even if it's difficult. He's not forcing anything on her, just deciding it's not feasible. However, some might say that personal relationships shouldn't be based on nationality, especially if both parties are willing. But the guy's reasons are about the reality of their situations, not just personal dislike. \n\nI think the consensus here leans towards B, not in the wrong, because he's being honest and considering the societal impact, which is part of his culture's values. Plus, he was upfront and didn't lead her on.\n"
