I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 17, from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out, had fun, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They spent time alone, he enjoyed it, but when she wanted a real date, he said he needed to think. He rejected her because of societal pressures and the political situation between their countries.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a significant issue. People from these regions often face familial and societal opposition to relationships across the divide. The author mentions that both families would hate the other, and society wouldn't accept their relationship. That's a real concern. At 17, he's still young, and maybe he's thinking about long-term stability, like marriage, which is important in many cultures.\n\nBut wait, is it right to reject someone solely based on their nationality? Maya was from Israel, and he didn't want to risk societal backlash. But love and relationships are personal. Even if society disapproves, two people might still choose to be together. The question is whether his decision was justified. \n\nHe gave her a chance, hung out with her, found her nice, but then backed out because of external factors. Is that being in the wrong? On one hand, he's honest about not wanting to face societal rejection. On the other, he might have led her on by engaging in the Valentine's thing if he wasn't serious from the start. \n\nAlso, considering his age, he's still figuring out his values. However, rejecting someone because of their nationality could be seen as prejudiced, even if it's due to political tensions. But the situation isn't just about nationality; it's about the deep-seated conflict between their nations. So it's a complex issue where personal feelings and societal pressures clash.\n\nI think the key point is whether his rejection was based on genuine reasons or if he was avoiding responsibility. He admitted that he liked her and had a good time, but the societal factors made him think it's not feasible. It's a tough spot, but if he's making a decision based on realistic expectations of societal rejection and potential family disapproval, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's using that as an excuse to avoid a relationship he's not ready for, then maybe he is. \n\nSince the user is asking if he's the asshole, people might argue both sides. Some would say he's being realistic, others might say he's letting politics get in the way of love. But given the context of the conflict and the age, I think he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
