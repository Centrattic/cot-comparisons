I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl because she's from Israel. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, moved to the US, and met Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out a bit, and when she asked to be Valentine's, he considered it but ultimately rejected her due to societal pressures and the conflict between their nations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and political context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a long-standing and sensitive issue with deep historical roots. Both sides have strong nationalistic sentiments, and relationships between people from these groups can face opposition. The author mentions societal pressures, like his community disapproving and the idea of \"selling out\" his country. That's a significant factor in his decision-making.\n\nBut then there's the personal aspect. Maya was described as fun, outgoing, and someone he enjoyed spending time with. They had a few dates, and the author seemed to have feelings but was hesitant because of future marriage prospects. He rejected her before getting into a serious relationship, citing societal reasons. The question is whether this decision is justified.\n\nOn one hand, societal pressures and family expectations can heavily influence decisions, especially in tight-knit communities. The author is considering the potential future challenges, such as family disapproval and lack of social acceptance. That shows he's thinking about long-term implications, which is responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya was being upfront about wanting to date him, and he rejected her not based on personal incompatibility but because of her nationality. That could be seen as discriminatory. It's important to consider if he's making a choice that's based on prejudice or realistic expectations. However, he's also weighing the societal consequences and the possibility of their relationship not being accepted. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did give her a chance and considered the relationship before deciding. He wasn't immediately dismissive but thought it through. However, the rejection might have been influenced more by external pressures than personal feelings. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's tricky. If the author genuinely believes that societal pressures would make the relationship unsustainable, he's acting in the interest of both parties by not pursuing something he thinks won't work. But if the rejection is based on deep-seated prejudice without considering the possibility of mutual effort to overcome obstacles, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's decision is based on realistic, unavoidable obstacles or if it's a preemptive rejection due to societal norms without considering their personal compatibility and the possibility of working through the challenges. Since the author is young (17), his perspective might be heavily influenced by his community's views, which could cloud his judgment. However, acknowledging the reality of societal pressures is also a valid consideration.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his assessment of future challenges. However, some might argue that he's avoiding a personal connection due to nationalistic reasons. But given the context, it's a complex situation where both personal feelings and external factors are at play.\n"
