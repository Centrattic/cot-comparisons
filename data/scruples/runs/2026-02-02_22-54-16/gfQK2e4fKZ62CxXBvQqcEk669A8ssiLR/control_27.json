I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. First, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 17, from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, moved to the US. He's been hanging out with a group that includes Maya, an Israeli girl. Their interactions started as friends but became more personal. The key point is that he rejected her because of societal pressures and the conflict between their countries.\n\nHe mentions that his and her families would hate the relationship due to political tensions. He's concerned about not being accepted and the possibility of marriage. So, is he wrong?\n\nWell, relationships based on nationality can be complex due to political and cultural reasons. But personal choice is important. The author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of external factors. However, he did spend time with her and showed interest initially. Rejecting her now based on societal views might be seen as not taking responsibility for his own choices. But he's also realistic about the challenges they'd face.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his reasons. He didn't lead her on and gave her a chance. The question is if avoiding a relationship due to societal pressures makes him an asshole. Some might argue that he's being pragmatic, while others might say he's avoiding a meaningful relationship because of others' opinions.\n\nIn the AITA format, usually, people are called out if they're inconsiderate or dishonest. Here, he's upfront about his reasons. But the fact that he considered the societal implications and decided not to proceed might be seen as not being in the wrong. So, maybe B is the answer.\n"
