I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke, leading to some one-on-one time. He considered it as a possible date but decided to reject her because of the political tensions between their countries, knowing the societal backlash from both sides. He's worried about future marriage prospects and the disapproval from their families and communities.\n\nThe key points here are the cultural and political context. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a sensitive and long-standing issue. The author's decision is based on the reality of societal attitudes and potential familial disapproval. However, Maya is Israeli, and their relationship could be seen as a personal choice despite political differences. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants a relationship where marriage is possible. Since societal and family opposition is a significant barrier, he's choosing not to pursue it. But is this fair? On one hand, he's being honest about his values and the challenges. On the other, Maya might feel rejected for reasons beyond her control\u2014her nationality isn't her choice. \n\nThe question is whether rejecting someone based on national identity related to political conflict is wrong. It's a complex issue. The author isn't forcing anything; he's choosing not to date her due to external factors. Some might argue that personal relationships should transcend political issues, while others might see his honesty as a positive, avoiding future pain. \n\nAlso, considering the age (17), he's still forming his views. The societal pressure is real, as he mentions others would be \"sad\" about him dating an Israeli. However, Maya's perspective isn't considered in the post\u2014how does she feel about the situation? But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, maybe that's not necessary. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author is being honest and not being deceptive, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's using national identity as a reason when other factors could be at play, it's more complicated. However, the author clearly states the societal issues as his main concern. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether prioritizing societal approval and potential familial disapproval over the relationship is considered wrong. In many cultures, family and societal acceptance are crucial, so his decision might be justified from that perspective. However, in more individualistic societies, people might prioritize personal happiness over societal expectations. \n\nGiven the context, the author is making a choice based on his values and the realities he's aware of. It's not that he's being cruel, but pragmatic. The question is whether that prudence makes him an asshole. The AITA community often looks at intent and harm. The author didn't lie; he was upfront. Maya might feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about his stance. So, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
