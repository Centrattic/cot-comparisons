I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is a Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he agreed to. They had a few \"fake\" dates, and then he rejected her because of societal pressures\u2014specifically the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. He explained that their families and society wouldn't accept their relationship due to the ongoing conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his values and the societal context. He mentions that he wants a relationship where marriage is possible, which implies he's considering long-term compatibility. His rejection is based on real-world factors like family disapproval and societal judgment, which he's clearly aware of. He did give Maya a chance to get to know her and even spent time with her, which shows he wasn't dismissive initially.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt because he didn't pursue the relationship despite getting along well. Choosing not to date someone solely because of their nationality could be seen as prejudiced, especially if he's willing to overlook other differences but not this one. However, given the historical and political tensions between their countries, his stance isn't entirely without context. It's a sensitive issue where personal feelings can be influenced by broader conflicts.\n\nI need to consider cultural and societal norms. In some contexts, such a rejection might be viewed as understandable due to the deep-seated tensions. In others, it could be seen as letting external pressures override personal feelings. The key points are his honesty and the specific societal context. The user didn't lie about his feelings; he was upfront about his concerns from the beginning. Also, since they were in the early stages of a possible relationship, it's not like he ended a long-term relationship but rather set boundaries early.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might hinge on whether the rejection is seen as justified by his reasons or as an unfair judgment. If the conflict between their countries is a legitimate concern that affects both families and societal acceptance, then his decision could be viewed as a realistic assessment rather than being in the wrong. However, if the rejection is based on prejudice without considering Maya's individual merits, then he might be at fault. But given the explanation he provided, it's more about acknowledging societal realities rather than personal bias against her as an individual.\n"
