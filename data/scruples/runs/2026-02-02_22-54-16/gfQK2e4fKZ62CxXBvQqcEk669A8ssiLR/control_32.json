I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their national backgrounds.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who moved to the US. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he accepted. They spent time together, but when she asked for a real date, he hesitated and eventually rejected her, citing societal disapproval from both their families and communities.\n\nThe key factors here are the reasons for the rejection. The author states that he's concerned about societal acceptance and the potential backlash from both families. He mentions that his parents and hers would hate each other because of their nationalities. Also, he wants to ensure that any relationship could lead to marriage, which he feels isn't possible given the circumstances.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is he in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his feelings and the challenges they would face. He's not pretending to like her; he's upfront about the societal pressures. However, some might argue that he's making a decision based on external pressures rather than his own genuine feelings towards Maya. Others might say that he's being realistic about the societal context and the potential difficulties they would both face.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt because he didn't consider the possibility of overcoming those challenges or that he's letting societal norms dictate his personal choices. But the author is clear that his decision is based on his values and the current geopolitical tensions between their nations.\n\nIn many cases, people make relationship decisions based on factors like cultural, religious, or family expectations. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his values and the potential societal impact. However, it's also important to consider whether he gave Maya a fair chance or if he was influenced more by external pressures than his own feelings.\n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his reasoning is valid. If the decision is based on his genuine beliefs and the realities of the situation, then it's not inherently wrong. It's a personal choice influenced by his cultural context. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
