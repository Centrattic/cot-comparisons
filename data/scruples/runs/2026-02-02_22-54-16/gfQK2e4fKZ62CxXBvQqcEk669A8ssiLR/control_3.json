I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The situation is between a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US and an Israeli girl. They were hanging out, and he considered them as potential romantic partners but rejected her due to societal and political tensions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's a deeply sensitive issue where historical and political factors play a significant role in people's lives. The author mentions that his community and her parents would disapprove, and he's concerned about societal acceptance. That's a real challenge.\n\nBut then, the question is whether rejecting someone solely based on their nationality is wrong. The girl was from Israel, and he's Palestinian. He says he wants a relationship where marriage is possible, implying long-term commitment. However, his rejection is based on societal pressures and the idea that their nations are enemies. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his values and the reality of their situation. He's not pretending to be interested when he's not. On the other hand, rejecting someone because of their nationality could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the issue isn't about personal values but external pressures. The girl might feel that he's making a judgment based on political conflict rather than who she is as a person. \n\nHe did give her a chance, which is positive. They had a good time together, and he acknowledged her qualities. But his decision is rooted in societal expectations and the conflict between their countries. That's where the moral dilemma lies. Is it wrong to prioritize societal acceptance over personal feelings? Or is it understandable given the context?\n\nIn many cases, people consider cultural and familial expectations when making life decisions. However, relationships are also personal. If the author's stance is that he can't be with someone from Israel regardless of the individual's character, that's a choice, but some might argue it's prejudicial. Others might empathize with his position due to the conflict's intensity.\n\nThe key here is whether the rejection is based on who the girl is as a person or just her nationality. Since he mentions she was funny, outgoing, and they had fun, it's clear he liked her as a person but still chose to reject her because of the political situation. That suggests the conflict is a significant barrier.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong answer here. It's a complex situation influenced by political tensions. However, from a moral standpoint, some might say he's in the wrong for letting political issues dictate a personal relationship, while others might support his decision based on the reality they face. The answer likely depends on cultural and personal values towards such conflicts.\n"
