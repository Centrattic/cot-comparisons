I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality who moved to the USA. He's been hanging out with a group that includes an Israeli girl named Maya. They had some fun times, and she asked to be his Valentine as a joke, leading to a few one-on-one hangouts. He felt the relationship might lead to a date but then decided to reject her because of the political situation between their countries. He says he can't date her because of societal reactions and the idea that their families and society wouldn't accept a Palestinian man dating an Israeli woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is young, 17, and might not have fully developed views on relationships versus political issues. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a significant and sensitive topic. He mentions that his parents and hers would hate the idea, and others in their society would look negatively upon it. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is it right to reject someone based on their nationality? The question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are personal choice versus societal pressure, and whether the decision is fair. The author didn't act on feelings of hatred but based on societal acceptance and the potential for conflict. However, relationships are personal, and unless there's a direct harm or coercion, personal choice shouldn't be dictated by others' opinions. \n\nAlso, considering the girl's perspective, Maya seems to be a friendly and open person who made an effort to get to know him. By rejecting her because of the political situation, the author is prioritizing external factors over their personal connection. It could be seen as a way to avoid potential judgment from others rather than a genuine incompatibility. \n\nBut the author isn't in a relationship with her yet. They had fake dates and some hangouts, but he's not ready to commit because of the societal implications. It's his choice, but some might argue that using the political conflict as a reason to reject her could be seen as closed-minded or perpetuating the division between their people. Others might say it's a realistic assessment of the situation, given the tensions and family expectations.\n\nHowever, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is rejecting her not out of personal dislike but because of external pressures, it's a matter of personal values. But relationships are between two people, and unless there's a mutual agreement, refusing based on nationality could be considered discriminatory. So, the answer might depend on cultural context and individual ethics. \n\nIn many cases, choosing not to date someone because of their country of origin is similar to discrimination based on race or ethnicity, which is generally frowned upon. The author might believe that societal pressures make the relationship impossible, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. It's a complex situation where personal feelings and political realities clash. \n\nBut given that the user is asking if he's the asshole, the community's response would probably consider that while the conflict is real, using it to reject someone without a personal issue might be seen as avoiding the problem. The author might be in the wrong for letting political issues interfere with a personal relationship that both individuals might have wanted to explore further. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, he is in the wrong) because rejecting someone solely based on their nationality in a personal relationship, especially when the individuals themselves are open, can be seen as discriminatory and not respecting personal connections over political ones.\n"
