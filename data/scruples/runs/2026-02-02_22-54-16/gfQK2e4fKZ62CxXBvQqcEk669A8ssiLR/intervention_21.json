I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian with Jordanian nationality in the US, and he's rejected Maya, the Israeli girl, because of societal pressures and the conflict between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The Middle East conflict is a complex issue with deep historical roots. Both Palestinians and Israelis have strong feelings about each other, and relationships between people from these groups can be really sensitive. The author mentions that societal pressure is a big factor\u2014people around them would disapprove, and their families would hate each other. He also says he wants to ensure marriage is possible, which in his case requires societal acceptance.\n\nNow, looking from a personal choice perspective, the author is making a decision based on his values and the reality he's facing. He's not forcing Maya to be with him; he's being honest about his concerns. Maya initiated the Valentine's thing, but he took time to think and then explained his reasons. He's not in a relationship yet, so he's not breaking any commitments. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's avoiding the relationship due to external pressures rather than personal feelings. However, the author is clear that his decision is based on his priorities\u2014wanting a future with marriage and societal acceptance. It's his right to choose partners based on his values, even if it's influenced by external factors like family and societal expectations.\n\nAdditionally, the author isn't being disrespectful. He's giving Maya a chance, but ultimately decides it's not feasible. There's no indication of hatred or prejudice in his reasoning; it's more about practical concerns. So, while some might disagree with his choice, he isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a decision that aligns with his beliefs and circumstances.\n"
