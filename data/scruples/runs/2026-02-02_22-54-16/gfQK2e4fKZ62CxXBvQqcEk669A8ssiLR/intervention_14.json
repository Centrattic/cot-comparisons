I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The scenario is that the author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He spent time with a group that included an Israeli girl, they had some time alone, and he ended up rejecting her because of societal pressures and the political conflict between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, which is a young age, and he's dealing with cultural and political tensions. He mentioned that his family and society might not accept a relationship with someone from Israel. He also said that he dates with the intention of marriage, so he's setting a high standard.\n\nThe key points here are his reasoning: societal expectations and the potential for not working out because of the conflict. But is it fair to reject someone based on their nationality? The girl, Maya, was from Israel, and he felt pressure from both sides' families. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for making that choice.\n\nIn relationships, people often consider compatibility beyond just nationality. But in this case, nationality is tied to a deep political conflict. The author might be making a realistic assessment based on the environment, but is that a valid reason to reject someone? On one hand, if he's certain that society and family would block any chance of a relationship, maybe he's being honest. On the other hand, rejecting someone solely because of their nationality could be seen as prejudicial, especially if there's a genuine connection.\n\nBut the author isn't rejecting her out of hate; he's stating that societal factors make a future difficult. He also gave her a chance and spent time with her. So, the decision might be based on practical considerations rather than hatred. However, others might argue that he should look beyond societal pressures and make his own choice.\n\nThe answer depends on whether rejecting based on nationality is considered wrong. Some might say it is, others might understand the context. Since the author isn't acting out of malice but practicality, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a perspective that any discrimination is wrong regardless of circumstances. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to see if that's justified.\n"
