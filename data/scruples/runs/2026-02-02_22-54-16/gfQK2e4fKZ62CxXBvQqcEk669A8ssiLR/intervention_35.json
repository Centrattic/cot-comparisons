I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian with Jordanian nationality in the US. He met a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, and he considered it for a real date but decided against it because of societal pressures from both sides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is deeply rooted and complex. The author is sensitive about his Palestinian identity and the political situation. He mentions that if he were to date someone from Israel, there would be strong disapproval from both families. He's thinking about long-term commitment, like marriage, which requires societal acceptance. \n\nThe question is whether rejecting her based on nationality makes him an asshole. The author isn't being aggressive or hurtful; he's being honest about his feelings and the challenges. He gave her a chance, spent time with her, and then explained his reasons. Maya's parents and his parents would oppose it, which adds to the difficulty. \n\nIn terms of personal choice, people have the right to choose their partners based on their own beliefs and circumstances. The author isn't forcing her or being disrespectful. He's making a decision that aligns with his values and the reality of their situations. However, some might argue that his decision is influenced by prejudice or fear of societal judgment rather than his own feelings. \n\nBut considering the historical and political tensions, it's understandable that he's concerned about societal acceptance. The fact that he's willing to consider a relationship but ultimately decides against it due to these factors shows he's not being closed-minded initially. He's weighing the potential consequences of their relationship in their current contexts. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If we look at it from an individual choice perspective, no. He's being honest and making a decision based on his beliefs and the reality he's aware of. However, if the argument is that he should be open to relationships regardless of nationality, then there's a different perspective. But the question is whether he's an asshole for rejecting her. Since he's not acting maliciously, but rather considering the broader implications, I think the answer is B.\n"
