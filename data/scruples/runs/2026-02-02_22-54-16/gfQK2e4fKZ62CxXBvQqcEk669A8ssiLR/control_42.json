I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is from Palestine, has Jordanian nationality, and moved to the US. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some hangouts, but he eventually rejected her because of societal issues and family pressures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is deep-rooted. The author is concerned about societal and familial rejection. He mentions that people would look shocked and accuse him of \"selling\" his country. His parents hate Maya's parents because of their nationalities.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's making a decision based on his values and the reality of the situation. He's 17, which is a time when people are forming their identities and considering future possibilities. He's honest with Maya about his decision, which shows respect for her. He didn't lead her on; he gave it a chance but realized the societal pressures are too much.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's letting external pressures dictate his personal choices. Maya is an individual, not just a symbol of her country. But the author is prioritizing his family and community's acceptance, which is a valid concern in many cultures. It's about personal values versus societal expectations.\n\nHe's not in the wrong if he's being truthful and not intentionally causing harm. He's not exploiting Maya or being insincere. He's making a choice based on his realities. So the answer would likely be B (No), but the situation is complex. The key points are honesty, cultural context, and the reality of the conflict affecting personal relationships.\n"
