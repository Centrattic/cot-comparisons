I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a Palestinian man with Jordanian nationality who's in the US. He met a girl named Maya from Israel, and they started hanging out. They had fun, and she asked to be his Valentine, which he agreed to. They did a few things together, but when she asked for an actual date, he said he needs to think. Eventually, he rejected her because of the political situation between Palestine and Israel.\n\nSo the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that their families and society wouldn't accept a relationship between them because of the conflict. He mentions that others would be shocked and call it selling the country. He also states that he wants to marry someone and isn't sure if a relationship with someone from Israel would work due to societal pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is deeply rooted and affects personal relationships. The author feels that their national backgrounds make a relationship impossible. He didn't lie; he was honest about his concerns. Maya initiated the interactions, but he made his reservations clear from the start. When she asked to be his Valentine, he went along but was probably aware of the potential issues.\n\nHe also mentions that his parents and her parents would hate the idea. Societal pressure is a real factor here. However, the question is whether rejecting her solely because of her nationality makes him an asshole. On one hand, he's being honest about his inability to commit due to external factors. On the other hand, some might see it as a form of discrimination or prejudice based on nationality.\n\nThe key points are: he gave her a chance despite his initial reservations, the rejection was based on societal and familial pressures, and he didn't force the relationship. However, some might argue that personal relationships shouldn't be dictated by political conflicts. But given the intense nature of the conflict and the personal safety and acceptance issues, his decision could be seen as a realistic assessment of the situation rather than being in the wrong.\n\nIn many cases, people consider family and societal acceptance when making decisions about relationships. The author isn't forcing Maya into anything; he's being upfront about his limitations. So, while some might criticize the decision, it's not necessarily \"asshole\" behavior. It's a complex situation where personal feelings clash with external realities.\n"
