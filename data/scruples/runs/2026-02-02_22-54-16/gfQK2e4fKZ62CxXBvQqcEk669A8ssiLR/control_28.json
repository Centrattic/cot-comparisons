I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who rejected an Israeli girl he was getting close to because of their nationalities and societal expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is from Palestine, and the girl is from Israel. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is well-known, and there's significant political and social tension. The author mentions that society would not accept their relationship due to the conflict. He also states that he's looking for a possibility of marriage, which he feels is impossible given the circumstances.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's making a decision based on personal values and societal pressures. On the other hand, he's rejecting someone based on her nationality, which might be seen as prejudiced. However, he also mentions that he gave her a chance and that they enjoyed each other's company. The key here is whether his decision is justified by his personal beliefs and the realities he faces.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is not forcing her; he's choosing not to pursue a relationship due to external factors. However, he might be influenced by stereotypes or societal norms rather than personal compatibility. But since he's considering future marriage and societal acceptance, it's part of his personal decision-making process.\n\nIn many cultures, societal and familial pressures can heavily influence personal relationships. The author is being honest about his stance. Whether that's \"wrong\" depends on the perspective. If the user is asking about moral wrongdoing, it's subjective. However, the act of rejecting someone based on nationality is similar to other forms of discrimination, but in the context of a conflict, it's a complex issue.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his beliefs and the societal context he's in. It's not necessarily the right choice, but it's his own decision, and he's being honest. The alternative view is that he's in the wrong for not overcoming societal prejudices, but given the context, it's a nuanced situation.\n"
