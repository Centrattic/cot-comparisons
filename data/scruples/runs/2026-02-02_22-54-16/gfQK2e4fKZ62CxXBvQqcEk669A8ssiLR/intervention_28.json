I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl from dating her because of their national backgrounds. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality in the US. He had a friendly connection with Maya, an Israeli girl, but decided not to pursue a real relationship due to societal and familial pressures. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The situation involves a real-life conflict between Palestine and Israel, which is a sensitive political issue. The author is aware of the negative reactions from both his community and Maya's parents. He's concerned about societal acceptance and potential backlash.\n\nNow, the question is whether rejecting someone for reasons related to their nationality is wrong. In many cases, people might object to relationships based on race, culture, or nationality as it can be seen as discriminatory. However, the author's reasoning is not just about personal preference but also about the real-world consequences\u2014family and societal rejection. \n\nAt 17, the author is still young and forming his views. The decision might be influenced by the intense political environment and the fear of how others would perceive the relationship. But does that make it right? On one hand, it's about personal choice and the reality they're facing. On the other hand, it could be seen as letting external factors dictate his personal life.\n\nAlso, the girl in question was genuinely interested in him, and he was on the fence about being in a relationship with an Israeli. The author might feel that the societal pressures are too much to handle, especially considering the ongoing conflict and the strong feelings on both sides. \n\nBut is it fair to reject someone based on factors beyond their control, like where they were born or their nationality? That's a common debate in relationships. However, the author isn't just rejecting her for who she is as a person but because of external circumstances and how others might react. It's a complex situation where personal feelings and societal expectations clash.\n\nIn some cultures, family and community approval are very important, and the author might be prioritizing those values. However, the question is whether that justifies the rejection. If the author truly felt that the relationship wouldn't work due to the societal pressures, maybe it's a realistic decision. But others might argue that love and relationships should transcend such boundaries.\n\nSo, weighing all factors: the author's age, the real societal issues, and the personal conflict between feelings and external pressures. The answer might hinge on whether the decision was made out of genuine incompatibility or just fear of others' opinions. If the author is making a choice based on his own beliefs and the realities he faces, perhaps it's not wrong. But if he's just succumbing to prejudice without considering the possibility of a relationship that could work despite the odds, then it might be considered wrong.\n\nIn the end, since the author is considering the impact of societal acceptance and family reactions, which are significant in this context, it's a matter of personal values and cultural expectations. There's no clear right or wrong, but the decision is made based on the author's understanding of his situation. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his environment and potential consequences.\n"
