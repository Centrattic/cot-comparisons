I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the US. They were friends with a group including an Israeli girl named Maya, eventually had some dates, but decided to reject her due to societal pressure and potential family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal factors. The author mentions that their society and families would not accept a relationship between a Palestinian man and an Israeli woman. This is a significant point because it's about personal values and family expectations. The user is in the US, so maybe the immediate family's influence is strong, but they're also in a new environment where such views might be more accepting. \n\nMaya's parents and the author's parents are against the relationship, which adds pressure. The author states they want to marry someone and ensure societal acceptance. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong to reject someone based on that? \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their values and future intentions. They might have realized that societal and family pressures would make a relationship unsustainable. On the other hand, Maya might feel that the author is letting external factors dictate their relationship instead of their feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether the decision is based on genuine incompatibility or just fear of societal judgment. The author mentions they were close and enjoyed each other's company, but the rejection is due to external pressures rather than personal incompatibility. That could be seen as not taking the relationship seriously enough to fight for it. However, if the author is firm in their values and the relationship wouldn't work due to family and societal issues, it's a valid reason.\n\nIn some contexts, people might consider it wrong to let family and societal pressures override personal happiness. However, in others, respecting family and cultural values is important. The answer might depend on the perspective of the person judging. Since the question is about the author being an asshole, considering the intent and the impact is key. The author was honest, but maybe could have given more time to see if societal issues could be managed. Alternatively, maybe they were realistic about the challenges.\n\nThe TL;DR says the rejection is because of nations that hate each other. That's a sensitive issue with real-world conflict. People might have different views on whether it's the right choice. But the author isn't forcing the girl into anything; they're choosing not to pursue it. The girl might be hurt, but the author isn't being dishonest. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their values and future goals. However, some might argue they should have considered giving the relationship a chance despite the challenges. But based on the information, the author's decision seems honest and realistic.\n"
