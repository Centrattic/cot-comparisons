I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The story is from a Palestinian boy in the US who met an Israeli girl, they became friends, she asked him to be her Valentine, and after some time, he rejected her due to societal and family pressures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is from Palestine but has Jordanian nationality. He moved to the US, and the girl is Israeli. The conflict between Palestinians and Israelis is well-known, with deep-rooted political and social tensions. The author mentions that both families would disapprove, and society would not accept their relationship. He states that he values the possibility of marriage and that social acceptance is a factor in his decision.\n\nThe question is whether his rejection is justified. On one hand, he's being honest about his values and the challenges they would face. He's not pretending to be interested when he's not. On the other hand, the girl might feel that he's using the conflict as an excuse, especially since they were getting along well, and he was interested in her initially. There's also the aspect of personal choice versus external pressures. \n\nIn many cultures, relationships between people from conflicting groups face significant obstacles. The author is aware of the societal backlash and the potential for being judged. However, some might argue that personal feelings and the possibility of a relationship should outweigh external factors. The author's reasoning is that societal acceptance is important for a lasting relationship, particularly marriage, which is a big commitment. \n\nBut is it fair to reject someone solely based on their nationality? The girl might not be responsible for the political situation. The author is making a choice based on his beliefs and environment. However, by doing so, he's prioritizing external validation over the relationship itself. \n\nIn terms of morality, if the author is honest and not leading her on, then maybe he's not at fault. But if he's using the conflict as a shield to avoid making a personal commitment despite his own feelings, that could be seen as a problem. The key here is whether his rejection is genuine or a cop-out. \n\nThe story mentions that he was into her and enjoyed spending time with her, but his concerns about family and society are valid in his context. So, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, the author is making a personal choice based on his values and circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
