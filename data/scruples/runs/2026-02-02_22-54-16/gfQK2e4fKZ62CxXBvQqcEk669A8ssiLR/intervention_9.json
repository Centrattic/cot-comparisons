I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their national backgrounds. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, and they moved to the US. He met a girl named Maya from Israel, and they hung out, but he eventually rejected her because of the political tensions between their countries. His parents and hers would hate the relationship, and he values marriage possibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal factors. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a sensitive and long-standing issue. In many communities, relationships between people from these regions can be seen as controversial or even taboo. The author is considering the societal backlash and family disapproval, which might be significant. \n\nHe mentions that when he tells others he's hanging out with someone from Israel, they react negatively. This suggests that external pressures are real and could affect his life if they were to date. The user argues that he's not in the wrong, maybe because he acted based on his values and the reality of societal rejection.\n\nBut is it fair to reject someone solely because of their nationality? That could be seen as discriminatory. However, the author isn't just rejecting her because she's Israeli, but because of the societal and familial implications for a long-term relationship. He also notes that he's considering marriage, which requires overcoming these obstacles. \n\nOn the other hand, personal choice in relationships is important. If Maya was open to the relationship and willing to face those challenges, maybe the author is making a decision based on fear rather than genuine compatibility. But the author is being honest about his reasons, which is, in itself, a responsible approach.\n\nIn many cases, people face pressures from family and society, and the decision to not pursue a relationship in that context is complex. It's not a simple right or wrong scenario, but a matter of personal values and circumstances. The author is being upfront and not leading her on, which is commendable. So, in this context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own values and the challenges they would face together.\n"
