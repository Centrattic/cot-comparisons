I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian from Jordan in the USA, and they got to know an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They went on a few \"fake\" dates, and he ended up rejecting her because he's concerned about societal backlash and the political situation between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their families and society would not accept a relationship between them. He's worried about how others might perceive it, even calling it \"selling\" his country. The key points here are his reasons for rejection: societal pressure, potential family disapproval, and the political conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's an asshole for that. The concept of AITA (Am I the Asshole) usually hinges on whether the person acted unkindly or wrongfully. The author didn't act out of malice; he's being honest about his feelings and the external pressures he's facing. He even mentions that Maya was a good person, and he was into her, but the societal and political factors made him pull back.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's using external factors as an excuse to avoid personal responsibility or to avoid a relationship he's not fully committed to. But given the severity of the political tensions and the potential consequences for both families, it's a complex situation. He's not rejecting her for her personality or actions, but because of her nationality and his own national identity.\n\nAnother angle: Maya's perspective. She might feel hurt that he didn't commit to exploring a relationship despite getting to know each other. But the author is upfront about his reasoning and doesn't deny her worth. He's being honest, which is generally considered a good trait.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and harm. The author didn't intentionally hurt her, but he did prioritize societal and political concerns over their potential relationship. However, given the circumstances, it's a difficult choice. The answer likely leans towards him not being the asshole because he's being honest and the reasons are tied to deep-seated political issues beyond personal dislike.\n"
