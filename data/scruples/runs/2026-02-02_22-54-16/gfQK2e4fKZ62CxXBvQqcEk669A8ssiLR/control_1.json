I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation is between a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the USA and an Israeli girl. They were hanging out, and the guy rejected her because of societal pressures and potential backlash from both their families and communities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's a long-standing issue with deep political and social tensions. The guy mentions that his family and her family would disapprove, and society might not accept a relationship. He also says he values marriage and wants to ensure a future with someone, which makes sense for him. \n\nBut then, is it justifiable to reject someone based on their nationality? The girl didn't ask him to choose between his identity and her. The guy is making a choice based on societal expectations rather than personal feelings. He might be avoiding potential conflict and the challenges of an intercountry relationship. However, some might argue that he's letting external pressures influence his personal decisions, which could be seen as cowardice or not taking a stand for his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 17, and making decisions about marriage at that age can be influenced by family and cultural norms. The girl initiated the dates as a joke, and he might not have been ready for something serious. Also, considering the political tensions, the practical aspects of a relationship between two people from such a contentious region could be real. \n\nBut the key point here is whether it's right to reject someone solely because of their nationality. The girl from Israel isn't at fault; the issue is more about the broader conflict. The author is choosing not to pursue a relationship due to external factors, not personal incompatibility. That might not make him the asshole, but it does highlight the impact of societal pressures on personal choices. \n\nI need to weigh personal autonomy against societal norms. The guy is making a choice based on his values and circumstances. However, if he feels he's making a decision out of fear or societal pressure rather than his own desires, that's a different angle. But given the situation, his reasoning is valid, even if others might criticize it. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives. In some views, prioritizing family and country over a relationship is seen as responsible; in others, it's seen as avoiding conflict and not standing up for personal happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his environment and future considerations. However, others might argue he's letting external factors dictate his personal life. The answer is B (No), but there's nuance here.\n"
