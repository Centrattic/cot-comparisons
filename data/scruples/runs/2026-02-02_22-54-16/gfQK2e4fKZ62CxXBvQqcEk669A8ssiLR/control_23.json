I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The situation is between a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US and an Israeli girl. They started hanging out as a group, then the girl asked him to be her Valentine, and later he rejected her because of societal pressures and the political situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is from Palestine, Jordanian citizen, moved to the US. The girl, Maya, is Israeli. They had a friendly group, then some dates. He rejected her because of potential societal backlash and the political context.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, people have the right to choose their partners based on personal reasons. But on the other hand, rejecting someone solely because of their nationality, especially in a context where there's a conflict, might be seen as prejudice. However, he mentions that he's sensitive about Palestine and that societal expectations are a factor. Also, he didn't go into the dates with the intention of dating her, but rather gave her a chance despite the background. \n\nHe also says that he considers marriage possibilities when dating, so maybe his reasoning is about long-term commitment rather than just a relationship. The societal pressure from both sides complicates things. His rejection is based on real-world issues like family and social acceptance. \n\nBut is that a valid reason? Some might argue that individuals should have the freedom to date whoever they choose, regardless of external factors. Others might say that given the political tensions, it's understandable to consider the consequences. The question is whether his reasoning is based on valid concerns or prejudice. Since he acknowledges the societal issues but also admits she's a good person (\"funny, outgoing, pretty\"), it might be more about external pressures than inherent dislike of her as a person. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to let external pressures influence a personal decision? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural context. In some cultures, family and societal expectations are heavily respected. In others, individual choice is prioritized. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his values and the realities he faces. However, others might argue that he's using the situation as an excuse to avoid a potentially controversial relationship. But given his explanation, it seems more about genuine concerns rather than prejudice.\n"
