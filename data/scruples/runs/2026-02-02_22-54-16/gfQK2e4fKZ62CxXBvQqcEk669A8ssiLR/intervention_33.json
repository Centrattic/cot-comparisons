I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for rejecting Maya because she's from Israel, while he's of Palestinian origin with Jordanian nationality. The situation involves cultural and political tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17 years old and moved to the USA recently. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through friends and they hung out a few times. The rejection is based on the societal and political conflict between their two groups. The author mentions that his community might react negatively if they dated, and his own parents would disapprove. He also says that he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, which isn't feasible due to these societal pressures.\n\nNow, the question is whether this rejection makes him the asshole. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and the challenges they would face. He's not pretending to be interested when he's not. On the other hand, Maya might feel hurt because she was getting closer to him, and he's making a decision based on external factors rather than personal feelings. But the author isn't forcing the relationship; he's choosing not to proceed because of real-world obstacles he's aware of at his age.\n\nI should also consider cultural sensitivity. In some contexts, people make decisions based on family approval and societal norms. The author is prioritizing his family's and community's acceptance, which is a valid concern. However, it's also important to recognize that Maya's feelings might be hurt. Still, the author isn't acting maliciously; he's being upfront about his stance.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author could have explored the relationship further despite the societal pressures. But given his age and the intensity of the conflict, it's understandable that he's cautious. The decision is pragmatic, not just based on prejudice.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author isn't being an asshole. He's making a difficult decision considering his background and future. The key here is honesty and not leading Maya on. Since he didn't express interest when he didn't have any, it's not his fault.\n"
