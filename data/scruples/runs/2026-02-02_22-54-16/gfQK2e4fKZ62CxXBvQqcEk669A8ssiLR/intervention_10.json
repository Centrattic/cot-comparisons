I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The situation involves cultural and political tensions between Palestine and Israel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a Palestinian-Jordanian in the US, and the girl is Israeli. They started hanging out as friends, then she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke, leading to some one-on-one time. He felt the relationship might not work due to societal pressures and family reactions. He rejected her because he believes their societies wouldn't accept a relationship between them, especially leading to marriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal choices based on their values and circumstances. The author is being honest about his feelings and the challenges they might face. However, some might argue that he's letting external pressures affect his personal decisions, which could be seen as unfair to the girl who was interested in him.\n\nBut then again, he's clear about his reasons: societal acceptance and family expectations. He didn't lead her on; he gave it a chance but decided it wasn't feasible. The girl's parents and his parents would likely disapprove, which is a real issue. In relationships, it's important to consider compatibility beyond just personal feelings, including external factors like family and societal acceptance, which can impact the relationship's sustainability.\n\nOn the other hand, rejecting someone solely because of their nationality might be seen as prejudiced, but the author isn't doing that per se. He's rejecting based on the societal implications and his own values. It's a complex situation where personal feelings clash with cultural and political realities.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's being honest and realistic about the challenges they would face. However, it's a nuanced issue. The answer might depend on perspectives: if the person is willing to face the societal judgment, then the author could be seen as avoiding commitment. But if the author genuinely believes the relationship isn't viable, then he's making a responsible choice.\n"
