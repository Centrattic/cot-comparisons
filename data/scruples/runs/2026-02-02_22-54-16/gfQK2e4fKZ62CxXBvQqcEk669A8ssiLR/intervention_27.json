I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation is about a Palestinian boy in the US who met Israeli girl Maya. They became friends, had some fun interactions, and she asked him to be her Valentine. He considered it but ultimately rejected her due to societal and political tensions between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, from Palestine with Jordanian nationality. He moved to the US recently. The main reason for the rejection is the societal and family opposition because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nIn relationships, personal choice is a big factor. The author is prioritizing his cultural and political background, which might be a valid reason for him. However, rejecting someone solely based on their nationality could be seen as discriminatory. But in this case, the conflict is a real and significant issue, affecting families and communities. The author might be considering the long-term feasibility of the relationship, given the societal pressures and the possibility of not being accepted by either family.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt because the decision was based on external factors rather than their personal connection. The author had a good time with her, and maybe a relationship could have been a chance despite the conflict. But he's also being realistic about the challenges they would face, like family disapproval and societal judgment.\n\nThe key points are: the author's reasons are based on real-world complications, not just personal dislike. He's being honest about his values and the potential issues. However, some might argue that using nationality as a reason for rejection is unfair, especially if the relationship could work despite the conflict.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no wrong in choosing not to pursue a relationship if one believes it's not viable due to external circumstances. The author isn't forcing anything on Maya; he's making a personal choice. But it's important to consider if this is a case of prejudice or practical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on his personal values and the realistic challenges he's aware of. Whether that's right or wrong depends on perspective. If the question is about being an asshole, it's more about whether he's being fair. He's not being mean, just realistic. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
