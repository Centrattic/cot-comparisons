I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who moved to the US. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he did. They had some one-on-one time, but when she asked for an actual date, he said he needed to think. Eventually, he rejected her because of societal pressures and the political tensions between their countries.\n\nThe key points here are cultural and societal factors. The author mentions that his community and hers would disapprove of a relationship between them. He also states that he only dates with the intention of marriage if things go well. His main reason for rejecting her is the societal acceptance issue, not any personal dislike towards Maya.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Is it wrong to base a rejection on societal expectations? It's a complex situation. On one hand, he's being honest about his values and the potential challenges they would face. On the other hand, Maya is an individual, and the author is choosing not to pursue a relationship based on political and societal factors beyond her control. \n\nBut wait, the author did give her a chance initially. He spent time with her and found her appealing. His rejection comes from a place of considering long-term societal pressures. However, some might argue that it's unfair to prioritize collective societal opinions over individual relationships. Others might understand his position given the deep-rooted conflicts between their communities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is clear about his stance and doesn't lead her on, then he's not being deceptive. He seems to have considered her as a person but realized that external factors might prevent a successful relationship. So, is he in the wrong? It's not straightforward. It depends on whether one values individual choice despite societal norms or prioritizes societal acceptance. The author is making a personal choice based on his values, which might not make him an asshole. So, the answer might be B.\n"
