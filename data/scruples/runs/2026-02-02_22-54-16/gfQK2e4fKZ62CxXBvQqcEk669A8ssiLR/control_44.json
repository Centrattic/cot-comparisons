I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is a 17-year-old Palestinian boy in the USA, Jordanian nationality, who befriended a group of people, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They spent time together, and he eventually rejected her because of their nationalities, saying societal issues would prevent a possible future together.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user is from Palestine and has strong feelings about the conflict with Israel. He's sensitive about it, which is understandable given the political and social tensions. The girl he was interested in is from Israel, and their families and society would likely oppose a relationship. He mentions that if he were to date her, people would disapprove, and their parents would hate each other. He also says he wants to consider marriage potential, which in his view is impossible due to these societal factors.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's making a choice based on his values and the reality of the situation. If he truly believes that their relationship would be unsustainable due to external pressures, then maybe he's being realistic. But on the other hand, is it fair for him to reject her solely based on her nationality without considering if they could overcome those obstacles? Relationships often face challenges, and some people do manage to make them work despite cultural or political differences. \n\nAlso, the fact that he spent time with her, enjoyed her company, and even considered a date suggests he had genuine feelings. But then he decided against it because of societal expectations. That might be seen as prioritizing societal opinions over his own feelings and the possibility of building a relationship. However, he's also young, 17, and might not be in a place to make a long-term commitment, especially given the complexities of the political situation. \n\nAnother angle: Maya is from Israel, and he's Palestinian. The conflict between their nations is a significant factor here. But is it right to judge someone's nationality as a deal-breaker? If he's rejecting her because of her nationality, not her as a person, that's a different issue. He seems to have liked her personally, but the national aspect was too much. \n\nSo, the key points are: his personal feelings vs. societal pressures, the reality of the conflict, and whether nationality should be a deciding factor in a relationship. The community might have mixed opinions. Some might say he's being realistic, others might say he's making a choice based on prejudice. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if he's being honest with her and not leading her on, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he was giving her false hope by spending time with her when he already knew he wouldn't pursue a relationship because of her nationality, that could be problematic. However, he mentioned that their dates were \"fake\" and that he was considering it, so maybe he wasn't leading her on. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. The decision is personal, and his reasons are based on his background and the societal context. So, the answer might swing towards him not being in the wrong (B) because he's making a personal choice based on his circumstances, even if it's a difficult one.\n"
