I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They started hanging out, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine, which he agreed to. They had some hangouts, and he felt like there was potential for a date. However, he ended up rejecting her because of the political situation between Palestine and Israel, worried about societal disapproval and not wanting to face criticism from others. His parents and Maya's parents would also disapprove.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for this decision. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no (he's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind his decision. He mentions that he's sensitive to Palestine and that societal pressures and family expectations are a concern. He wants to ensure that any relationship he's in could lead to marriage, which he's not willing to risk due to these external factors. \n\nOn one hand, it's important to respect his personal values and the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict is deeply rooted, and societal opinions can be very strong. His fear of disapproval from peers and family is real. However, on the other hand, he might be making a judgment based on nationality rather than the individual's character. Maya is described as funny, outgoing, and someone he enjoyed being with. By rejecting her solely because of her nationality, he's potentially letting political tensions interfere with a personal relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of love and relationships beyond societal expectations. While family and societal approval are important, they shouldn't necessarily dictate one's personal choices, especially in matters of the heart. If he's considering long-term commitment, it's valid to think about future challenges, but it's also important to acknowledge Maya as an individual person rather than just her nationality.\n\nHowever, the situation is complex because the conflict between their countries can create real obstacles. His parents' and Maya's parents' disapproval is a significant factor. Additionally, the fact that he's 17 and still young might mean he's not fully equipped to handle the complexities of an intercountry relationship, especially one with such historical tensions.\n\nBut is it fair to reject someone based on their nationality when the issue is more about political conflict than personal feelings? The author might be projecting the conflict onto his personal life, which is understandable given the context. Yet, Maya isn't responsible for the political situation, and rejecting her because of that could be seen as unfair. However, it's also his right to choose his relationships based on his values and what he can handle.\n\nThe key here is whether the rejection is justified. If he's genuinely not ready for the challenges that come with an intercountry relationship due to societal pressures and potential family issues, then his decision might be based on self-preservation. On the flip side, if he's avoiding responsibility for handling the relationship despite these challenges, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, in many cultures, people are encouraged to follow their hearts, but in highly politicized contexts, the pressure can be immense. The author might be making a pragmatic choice, but it's also important to recognize that Maya's identity as an Israeli is part of the conflict, which complicates things.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's being honest about his feelings and the reasons behind his decision. However, by rejecting Maya solely because of her nationality, he might be overlooking her as an individual. But given the context of the conflict, it's also a realistic decision he's making about his future. \n\nIn many similar situations, people are often advised to not let political issues interfere with personal relationships. However, the reality is that political tensions can have very real impacts on people's lives. The author's decision might be seen as pragmatic, but some might argue that it's unfair to Maya. \n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. However, since the question is whether he's the asshole, the answer would depend on whether his reasoning is valid. If his reasoning is based on genuine concerns about societal pressures and future challenges, then he's not the asshole. If he's choosing not to consider the relationship because of prejudice against Israelis, then he is. \n\nGiven that the author is considering potential marriage and societal acceptance, it's more about his personal boundaries and readiness. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that rejecting someone based on nationality is wrong regardless. However, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the added societal pressures, it's a complex situation where his decision could be seen as justified.\n"
