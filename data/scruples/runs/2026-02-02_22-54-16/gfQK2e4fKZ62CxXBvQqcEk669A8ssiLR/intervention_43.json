I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian but Jordanian, living in the USA now. They spent time with her and even went on fake dates, but decided not to pursue it further because of societal pressure from both sides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is a deep-rooted political and cultural issue. The author mentions that people close to them would disapprove, and the parents of both sides hate each other. The author is concerned about societal acceptance and possibly marriage in the future.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on practicality and social pressure. They might feel it's unrealistic to pursue a relationship where both families and communities would oppose it. But some might argue that by choosing not to pursue it, the author is avoiding a relationship due to others' opinions rather than their own feelings.\n\nHowever, the author did spend time with her and found her likable. They considered the possibility of dates, which shows they had some interest. But they prioritized long-term feasibility over immediate feelings, which is a valid consideration. The decision might be seen as pragmatic rather than selfish if they believe the relationship can't work in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author is letting external pressures dictate their personal choices. Love and relationships can be challenging, and the decision to reject her might be seen as a cop-out if the author is not fully committed to making it work despite the obstacles.\n\nBut given the situation, the author is making a choice based on their reality. They might not be in the wrong because they're considering the long-term implications, not just their current feelings. It's a tough spot, and the answer could depend on whether one values personal happiness over societal expectations.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's decision is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong (Answer B).\n"
