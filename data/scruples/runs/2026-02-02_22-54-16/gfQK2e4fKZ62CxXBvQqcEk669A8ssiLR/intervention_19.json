I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now living in the US. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They got along well, hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, but when she wanted to take it further, he rejected her because of societal pressures and the political situation between Palestine and Israel. He's worried about others' reactions and the fact that their families would hate such a relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasons. He's young, 17, so maybe he's still developing his views on relationships and politics. He mentions being sensitive about Palestine, which is a valid personal stance. The conflict between Palestinians and Israelis is real and deeply rooted, so societal pressures and family expectations are significant factors here. He's choosing to prioritize his cultural and political identity over a potential relationship, which is a personal decision.\n\nBut is it wrong to reject someone based on nationality? In many contexts, people might argue that it's unfair to judge someone because of their country of origin. However, the situation here is complicated by the historical and ongoing conflict. The author is aware that both families would disapprove, and he's concerned about societal acceptance. This isn't just a personal issue; it's a matter of broader political tensions.\n\nOn one hand, Maya is just an individual, and rejecting her based on nationality could be seen as discriminatory. But on the other hand, the author is making a conscious choice to align with his cultural values and the reality of the situation. He's not forcing Maya; he's being honest about his stance. Since he values the possibility of marriage and societal acceptance, his decision is based on his own criteria for a relationship.\n\nI should also consider the fact that he gave Maya a chance before making a decision. He didn't immediately reject her because of her nationality but spent time getting to know her. That shows he wasn't prejudiced from the start. His decision is more about the long-term feasibility of the relationship given external factors, not just personal dislike.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Maya. She might feel hurt, but he communicated his reasons clearly. He's not hiding behind a fa\u00e7ade; he's being upfront about his beliefs. The question is whether his reasons are valid. In a different context, rejecting someone for such reasons might be seen as wrong, but in a region with such a complex conflict, it's a personal choice influenced by cultural norms and family expectations.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's decision seems to stem from his personal values and the reality of the situation. While some might argue he's applying a stereotype (not all Israelis are the same), his choice is based on real societal challenges. Therefore, he's not in the wrong because he's making a decision that aligns with his cultural identity and the potential consequences he's aware of.\n"
