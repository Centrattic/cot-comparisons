      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is meant to show his lineage: parents, himself, daughter in Roman numerals stacked from oldest to youngest. The wife expected her DOB to be included, but it wasn't. She got upset, and the author's mom also sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now second-guessing the tattoo.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and expectations. The author mentioned the tattoo is for his lineage, direct descendants. He designed it as parents to him to daughter. The wife thought her DOB would be part of it, maybe assuming it's a family tree. The author didn't clarify that it's specifically his line, not the family tree. The mom's comment adds to the conflict, but maybe the main issue is the author not explaining the design clearly to his wife. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he didn't communicate the design intent properly, maybe he's responsible for the wife's misunderstanding. On the other hand, if the design was explicitly about his lineage (direct descendants), then maybe the wife's expectation was unreasonable. But maybe the author should have discussed it more with his wife since it's a significant decision involving her. Body autonomy is important, but relationships also require mutual consideration.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the design with his wife before deciding, especially since tattoos are permanent and involve personal significance. Even if the design was his vision, involving a spouse in such a decision could be necessary. Alternatively, if the design was clearly stated and the wife didn't ask, maybe not. But since the wife was shocked, maybe the author didn't explain enough. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because the author should have considered his wife's feelings and expectations, and maybe the tattoo's significance in their relationship. Not involving her in the decision-making process could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the design was his idea. The mom's support of the wife might complicate things, but the main issue is between the author and his wife.\n"
