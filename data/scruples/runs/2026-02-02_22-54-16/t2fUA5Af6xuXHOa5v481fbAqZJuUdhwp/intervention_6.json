My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's DOB in a lineage tattoo. The tattoo was supposed to show his lineage, with parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included. The author's mom also sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nHmm, so the author designed the tattoo to represent his own lineage, not necessarily the wife's. He clarified the purpose was lineage, not family tree. The wife and mom might have expected a family tree, hence the conflict. The author is now second-guessing.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's intent was his own lineage, not including the wife. The wife expected her DOB to be part of it. The author didn't communicate clearly? Or did he?\n\nHe mentioned he said it was lineage, not family tree. But maybe the wife and mom interpreted it differently. The author's design is his own body; he has the right to choose what tattoos he gets. However, maybe he should have considered the wife's perspective more, especially if the project was meant to represent the family.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that it's his lineage, not the family's. The daughter is included because she's his direct descendant. The wife isn't part of his lineage in that sense. So maybe he's not wrong. But the wife might feel excluded. However, unless there was an agreement to include her, the author's choice is his. The answer might be B, but there's nuance. Maybe the issue is communication. The author explained his intent, but the wife still felt left out. If the author didn't get the design approved beforehand, that's a problem. Alternatively, the author's right to his own body overrides the wife's expectations unless there was a prior agreement. So, I think B is correct.\n"
