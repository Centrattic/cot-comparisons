      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposed tattoo that includes the dates of birth of the author's parents, himself, and their daughter, but not his wife. The wife was upset that her DOB wasn't included, and the author's mother supported her, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's goal was to show his own lineage, which he defined as parents, himself, and their daughter. The wife expected her DOB to be included, possibly because she felt it was part of the family or lineage. The author's mother's comment adds another layer, suggesting that the daughter's existence is a result of both parents, which might imply that both spouses should be part of the lineage.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author mentioned that he explicitly stated the tattoo was to show his lineage, but maybe his explanation wasn't clear enough. The wife might have interpreted \"lineage\" as including both spouses, especially since the daughter is their child. The mother's support of the wife's stance could be because she sees the couple as a unit in creating the daughter.\n\nIs the author wrong for not including his wife's DOB? It depends on cultural or personal norms. In some contexts, lineage might be seen as the direct bloodline, which would include the author's parents, himself, and their daughter. However, a family tree might include both spouses. The author's design was specific to his lineage, but if the wife felt it was about the family as a whole, there's a disconnect in understanding.\n\nThe author changed the design after the wife's reaction. The question is whether he had the right to decide the design alone. Even if he didn't intend to exclude her, the wife's feelings were hurt. The author might be at fault for not considering her perspective and not discussing the design thoroughly beforehand. However, if he clearly communicated his intent and she still felt excluded, it's a matter of differing expectations.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his plan well and didn't consider her feelings, maybe. But if he was clear and she still felt left out, then perhaps not. The answer hinges on whether the author's communication was sufficient and whether the wife's reaction is reasonable given the explanation. Given that the mother sided with the wife, it might indicate that the author's explanation wasn't clear or that societal expectations view the spouse as part of the lineage. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the author communicated his intent clearly and the wife's expectations were different. However, if the author didn't adequately discuss it with her, leading to hurt feelings, then he might share some responsibility. Given the information, the author might not be in the wrong if he was clear, but there's a case for not being considerate enough. Since the user's initial thought is that the author is not at fault, leaning towards B.\n"
