My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife's date of birth on a tattoo that includes their parents, themselves, and their daughter. The tattoo is meant to show lineage from parents to them to their daughter in Roman numerals.\n\nThe wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included. The author explained it was lineage, not a family tree, so maybe the wife and mother misunderstood. The author changed the design after the wife was upset, so they're having second thoughts.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author clearly explain the design? They mentioned they said it was lineage, so maybe the wife didn't grasp the difference between lineage (direct descendants) and a family tree (which includes spouses). If the author was explicit, maybe the wife and mother misinterpreted it. However, maybe the author should have clarified further, especially since it's a permanent decision. Since the author changed the design after the wife's reaction, they might feel conflicted. But the author's original intent wasn't to include the wife, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
