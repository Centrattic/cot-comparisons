      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposed tattoo design that includes the dates of birth of the person's parents, themselves, and their daughter, but not the wife. The wife was upset that her DOB wasn't included, and the mother agreed with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original idea was to show lineage through direct descendants, so the author included their parents, themselves, and their daughter. That makes sense as a family tree, but the wife felt excluded. The author didn't mention including the wife, but the wife expected her DOB to be there. The author might not have communicated clearly about the design's purpose, leading to the misunderstanding. The mother's support for the wife adds another layer, possibly because she sees the daughter as a result of both parents, so including the wife's DOB would make sense from that perspective.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought they were clear about including only direct descendants, but maybe the wife interpreted it as a family tree where both parents' DOBs should be there. The author might have failed to explain that the design was specifically about their own lineage, not the wife's. Also, the wife's reaction being \"shocked and upset\" suggests a significant emotional response, which the author should consider. Even if the author's intention was clear to them, they might not have considered the wife's perspective, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one getting the tattoo, so they have the right to choose what's on their body. However, not discussing the design thoroughly with the spouse could be a miscommunication. The author might be in the right if they had clearly explained their reasoning, but if they didn't, that could be a problem. The answer depends on whether the author's communication was sufficient. Since the author mentions that the wife thought her DOB would be included and the mother sided with the wife, it's possible that the author didn't make their intent explicit enough. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their wife's expectations and for not adequately explaining the design's purpose.\n"
