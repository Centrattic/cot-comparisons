      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his lineage. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author wanted a tattoo showing his lineage: parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals. The wife thought her DOB would be included and got upset when it wasn't. The mother also sided with the wife, arguing the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now doubting if he did the right thing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author mentioned the tattoo's purpose is his lineage and direct descendants. The wife and mother felt her DOB should be included, maybe assuming it's part of the family tree. But the author's intention was lineage, which typically refers to direct line (parents, self, children), not spouse. Spouses aren't part of one's direct lineage unless they have children together. So from that perspective, the author might not be wrong in excluding the wife's DOB.\n\nBut did he communicate this clearly enough? The author said he explained the tattoo's purpose, but maybe it wasn't clear. The wife's expectation was different, leading to hurt feelings. The author's design choice is personal, but family matters can be sensitive. The mother's input adds another layer of pressure.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? If he explicitly stated the tattoo is about his lineage (not the entire family tree), then he's not in the wrong. However, if the communication wasn't clear and the wife felt overlooked, there might be some fault in not managing expectations. But given the explanation provided, the author's reasoning seems valid. Spouses aren't typically part of lineage tattoos, which focus on bloodline. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
