To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to include their wife's date of birth in a tattoo that represents their lineage. The design includes their parents, themselves, and their daughter in Roman numerals, stacked by age. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included, and the mother-in-law agreed, thinking the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show his lineage, which he defined as direct descendants. The wife might have interpreted the family tree differently, including the spouse as part of the lineage. The key here is communication. Did the author clearly explain the design's purpose? If he mentioned lineage as his direct descendants (parents, self, daughter), then excluding the wife might be his prerogative. However, the wife's reaction suggests she felt left out, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nThe author's mother-in-law siding with the wife adds pressure, but her reasoning is based on the idea that the daughter is a product of both parents. However, the tattoo is the author's personal expression. While the wife's feelings are important, the author isn't obligated to include her in a personal tattoo unless he agreed. The confusion might stem from the term \"lineage,\" which can be interpreted in different ways. If the author clearly communicated his intent, he's not wrong. But if there was a misunderstanding, maybe he should have considered her perspective. However, the final decision is his body, so he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
