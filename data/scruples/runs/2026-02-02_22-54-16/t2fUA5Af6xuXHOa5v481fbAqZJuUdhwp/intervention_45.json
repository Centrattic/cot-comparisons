      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents', his own, and his daughter's birth dates. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show his lineage from his parents through him to his daughter. He designed it with Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest. The wife expected her DOB to be included and was upset when it wasn't. The mother also sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's stated purpose was his direct lineage, which is parent, self, child. The wife and mother-in-law might have interpreted it as a family tree, hence expecting her inclusion. The author didn't mention the wife's DOB in the original plan, but maybe there was a miscommunication.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the tattoo is meant to show his direct lineage, then excluding the wife might be intentional. However, maybe the wife felt it was important to be included as a parent of the daughter. The author's explanation is technical (lineage vs family tree), but the wife and mother might see it differently. Did the author communicate clearly? If he didn't consider the wife's perspective, maybe he's at fault for not discussing it enough. But if he clearly stated his intent and the wife still had expectations, maybe not. The answer hinges on communication and mutual understanding. The author might have a valid reason, but the wife's feelings are valid too. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author's design explicitly stated lineage from his side, maybe he's not wrong. But if he didn't consider the wife's feelings, maybe he is. Hmm.\n"
