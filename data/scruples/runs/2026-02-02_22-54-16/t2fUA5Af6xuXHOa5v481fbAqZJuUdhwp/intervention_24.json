      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth on a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and their daughter. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included, and the mother-in-law agreed, saying the daughter came from both parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intention. The author clearly stated the purpose was to show his lineage, which he interpreted as direct descendants. His family tree goes parents \u2192 him \u2192 daughter. The wife felt her DOB should be there because she's the daughter's mother. But the author didn't mention her in the lineage structure. \n\nCommunication is key here. Did the author clearly explain the design to his wife before getting it? If he explicitly said it's about his lineage, not the entire family tree, maybe he's not at fault. However, if there was a misunderstanding because he didn't clarify, maybe he's responsible for the oversight.\n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is valid. She's a parent to the daughter, so feeling excluded is understandable. The mother-in-law's support for the wife's position might add pressure on the author. But the author's design decision is personal\u2014his tattoo, his body. However, involving family in such a personal decision can lead to conflicts if expectations aren't aligned.\n\nIs it wrong to exclude someone? It depends on how the design was communicated. If the author was clear about the purpose and the wife still felt excluded, maybe it's not his fault. But if he didn't communicate properly, leading to her misunderstanding, then he might have some responsibility. However, the final decision to get the tattoo is his, so he isn't necessarily in the wrong for not including a spouse's DOB if that wasn't part of the original plan.\n"
