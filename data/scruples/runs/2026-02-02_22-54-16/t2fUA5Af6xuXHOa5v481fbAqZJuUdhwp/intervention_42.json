To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's DOB in the tattoo. The tattoo is meant to show lineage from his parents to him to his daughter, using Roman numerals. The wife expected her DOB to be there, but the author didn't include it. The mother-in-law is siding with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents, so maybe the wife's DOB should be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author clearly stated the tattoo was about his lineage, meaning his direct line. His wife isn't in the direct lineage in the way the design is structured. The wife might have felt included because she's the mother, but the author's design focuses on his ancestry. That's a personal choice, and unless there was a mutual agreement beforehand to include her, it's his decision.\n\nHowever, communication is key here. If the author didn't clearly explain the design's intent, leading the wife to expect her DOB to be included, then maybe there's a miscommunication. But the author mentioned he said it was about his lineage, so maybe he did communicate it. Still, the wife's feelings are valid. She might feel excluded, especially since the daughter is their joint child.\n\nThe mother-in-law's side is a bit tricky. She might be trying to mediate, but it's possible she's adding pressure. The author's hesitation now could stem from the conflict arising, making him reconsider. But the core issue is whether excluding the wife is wrong. Since the design is his personal choice and lineage is typically about one's own line, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, it's a sensitive topic. Maybe the answer is B, but with consideration for the wife's feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't agree to include her, and the design was his personal choice, B is more appropriate.\n"
