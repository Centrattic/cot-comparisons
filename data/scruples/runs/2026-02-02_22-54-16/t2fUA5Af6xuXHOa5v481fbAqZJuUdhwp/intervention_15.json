My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents', his, and his daughter's dates. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage, going from parents to him to his daughter. The wife felt left out because she thought her DOB would be part of the tattoo, and his mom agreed, saying the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now considering changing the design.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author made a mistake. The key points are the intent of the tattoo and communication. The author explicitly stated the purpose was his lineage, which he defined as parents > him > daughter. He didn't mention the wife, so maybe he didn't consider her part of his direct lineage in this context. However, the wife and his mom felt she should be included because the daughter is a product of both parents. \n\nCommunication is crucial here. Did the author clearly explain the design to his wife? If he didn't mention that the tattoo was strictly about his direct lineage and not about the family as a whole from both parents' perspectives, then maybe he's at fault for not being clear. On the other hand, if he was explicit, then the wife and his mom might be misunderstanding the intent.\n\nAnother angle: the tattoo is on his body, so he has the right to decide what's included. However, relationships involve compromise. If the wife feels left out, maybe the author should consider her feelings. But he's having second thoughts about changing the design. It's a personal choice, but not including his wife could cause resentment.\n\nBut the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if the author's reasoning is valid. The tattoo's purpose was his lineage, which he defined as parents, himself, daughter. That's a personal choice. However, if the wife and his mom expected her to be included because of mutual parenthood, maybe the author didn't consider their perspective. But he might not have intended to exclude her. The question is whether he's wrong for not including her. If the design was clearly about his direct lineage, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he failed to communicate this clearly, perhaps he is partially at fault for the misunderstanding. However, the answer hinges on whether the author's intent was properly communicated. If he did explain and the wife still misunderstood, then he's not wrong. If he didn't explain, maybe he is. Since he mentioned he said it was about his lineage, maybe he's not wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
