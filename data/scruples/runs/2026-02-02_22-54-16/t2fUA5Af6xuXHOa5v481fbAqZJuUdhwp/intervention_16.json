To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a tattoo design that includes the author's parents, himself, and his daughter, but not his wife. The wife expected her birthday to be included, but the author didn't want it. The author's mom side with his wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author designed a tattoo to represent his lineage, which he defines as his parents, himself, and his daughter. The wife felt left out because her birthday wasn't included, which the author didn't plan to add. The author's mom supported the wife's perspective, emphasizing that the daughter comes from both parents. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intention with the tattoo, the wife's expectation, and the mom's influence. The author's explanation is that the tattoo shows his lineage, which he interprets as direct descendants. The wife and mom see the daughter as a product of both parents, so the wife's inclusion is expected. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not including his wife's birthday. To determine this, I need to consider communication and mutual understanding. Did the author clearly explain his intent? The user says he mentioned it was about lineage, but the wife still had expectations. Maybe he didn't fully communicate that the design was from his perspective, not including his wife. \n\nAlso, cultural norms might play a role. In some contexts, tattoos symbolizing family might include both spouses. However, others might see it as personal. The author's mom's support for the wife complicates things, as it adds pressure from the family side. \n\nI should also consider the emotional aspect. The wife was shocked and upset, which indicates that the author's decision caused her distress. Even if his intention was clear to him, if he didn't convey it effectively, it's possible he didn't consider how his wife would feel. \n\nThe author is now second-guessing, which suggests he might realize there's a problem. But was it wrong initially? If the tattoo is a personal choice, then maybe not. However, if the wife's exclusion was due to poor communication or not considering her feelings, then maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nIn summary, the author's intention wasn't clearly communicated to his wife, leading to her upset. The mom's support for the wife adds another layer. The answer hinges on whether the author's design was unilaterally decided without considering the wife's perspective. If the author didn't involve the wife in the decision-making process, that could be a point against him. However, if he clearly explained his intent and she still had expectations, then it's a matter of differing values. But given the wife's shock and the mom's reaction, it's more likely that the author didn't effectively communicate or consider his wife's feelings, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
