My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife's DOB tattooed on them along with their family. The tattoo design includes their parents, themselves, and their daughter, but not the wife. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included. The author's mom also took the wife's side, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and perspective. The author said they wanted to show their lineage, which they interpreted as direct descendants from them. The wife expected her DOB to be part of that lineage, maybe thinking of the family tree more broadly. The author might not have clearly communicated that the tattoo was specifically about their direct line, not the entire family. The wife's reaction suggests she felt excluded or not considered part of the lineage, which is a valid emotional response. The mother's support of the wife could indicate that the author's explanation wasn't clear enough. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they had the right to decide what goes on their body, but if they didn't communicate the design intentions clearly, they might have caused misunderstanding. The wife's hurt feelings are important. The author might be in the wrong for not discussing the design thoroughly with their wife beforehand, leading to her feeling excluded. So, answer A.\n"
