      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a tattoo design that includes the dates of birth of his parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals, stacked to show lineage. His wife and mother are upset because they expected her (the wife's) DOB to be included. The author didn't include it because he wanted to show his lineage, not the wife's.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's intention was to represent his own lineage, so he excluded his wife's DOB. The wife thought it should be part of the tattoo because they have a daughter together. The mother also supported the wife's view, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. Lineage typically refers to one's own family line, so including only the author's side makes sense. However, in a family context, especially with a spouse, expectations might differ. The wife might feel her contribution is being overlooked, even if the tattoo is about the author's lineage.\n\nCommunication is key here. Did the author clearly explain the purpose of the tattoo to his wife? The author says he mentioned it was to show his lineage and direct descendants. If he did, then maybe the wife misunderstood. But maybe the author didn't anticipate that the wife would want her DOB included as part of the family. It's possible that in the context of their marriage, the wife might expect shared symbols or representations.\n\nAnother angle: The tattoo is on the author's body, so he has the right to decide what's included. However, involving a spouse in such a permanent decision might require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult the wife about the design, which could be a problem. If the wife had input, maybe she would have been more comfortable. But the author's intent was personal, so maybe that's not necessary.\n\nThe second part is about the mother siding with the wife. The author's mother not having tattoos could influence her perspective, but maybe she thinks the design should be more inclusive. However, that's her opinion, not necessarily a right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's intention was clear, but he might not have considered the emotional impact on his wife. Even if the design is technically about his lineage, the spouse might feel excluded. The author's second thoughts suggest he's aware of potential issues. But is that enough to say he's at fault? Or is it a matter of differing expectations?\n\nI think the key here is whether the author should have included his wife's DOB despite his stated purpose. Since lineage is about his own family line, not the wife's, excluding her might be justified. However, the situation could have been handled better. Maybe the author should have discussed the design more thoroughly with his wife to explain the intent and see if she was okay with it. If he didn't, then maybe he's at fault for not considering her feelings. But if he did communicate clearly and she still felt upset, it's a misunderstanding.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was to represent his lineage, which doesn't inherently include his wife's DOB. However, the lack of communication or consideration for the wife's perspective might be the issue. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the communication was sufficient. If he did explain it and the wife still felt it should include her, then he's not wrong. But if he failed to explain or listen, then maybe he is. The answer might be on the fence, but the question is asking for AITA. Since the wife was shocked and the mother sided with her, perhaps the author is not in the wrong because the design is his personal choice, but he could have handled the communication better. The answer is B (No).\n"
