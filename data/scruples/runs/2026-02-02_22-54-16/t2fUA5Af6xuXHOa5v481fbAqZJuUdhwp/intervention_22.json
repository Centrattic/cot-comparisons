My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting to include their wife's date of birth in their tattoo that features their lineage. The tattoo design shows their parents, themselves, and their daughter using Roman numerals. The wife was upset because she expected her DOB to be there, and the mother-in-law agreed, saying the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated the purpose as lineage, which is about direct descendants. The wife might have assumed it was a family tree, hence expecting her own DOB. The mother-in-law's side-taking complicates things. The author's reasoning is that it's about their lineage, not the entire family, so excluding the wife might be reasonable. However, not considering the wife's feelings or the symbolic meaning of the tattoo could be a misstep. The key points are communication and intent. If the author had discussed the design thoroughly beforehand, maybe the wife wouldn't have felt excluded. But since the purpose was lineage, maybe it's not the author's fault. Still, the wife's reaction shows the design might have emotional implications they didn't foresee. So, is it a matter of differing expectations rather than the author being wrong? Maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance here.\n"
