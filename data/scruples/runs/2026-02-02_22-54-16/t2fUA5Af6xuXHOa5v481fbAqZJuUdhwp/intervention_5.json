      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's date of birth on a tattoo that includes his lineage. The tattoo includes his parents, himself, and their daughter, all in Roman numerals stacked from oldest to youngest. The wife was shocked and upset because she thought her DOB would be included. The mother also sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show his lineage, which would be his direct descendants. His wife might have expected her DOB to be part of the family tree, but the author's design was more about his direct line. The confusion might stem from the term \"family tree\" versus \"lineage.\" Lineage typically refers to one's direct line, not including a spouse. However, the wife might have felt excluded, especially since the daughter is their child together.\n\nThe author did mention the design clearly, but maybe he didn't communicate it well enough. The wife's upset reaction suggests she felt her role wasn't acknowledged. The mother's support of the wife might be based on traditional views where both parents are considered in family lineage. The author's second thoughts might come from realizing that his spouse's input or feelings weren't considered in the design.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he clearly communicated his intent and the design was based on his understanding of lineage, maybe not. But if the discussion about the tattoo didn't involve his wife adequately, leading her to believe her DOB would be included, then he might share some responsibility. The key points are communication and mutual agreement on family symbols. Since it's a personal choice about a body modification, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but there might be room for compromise.\n"
