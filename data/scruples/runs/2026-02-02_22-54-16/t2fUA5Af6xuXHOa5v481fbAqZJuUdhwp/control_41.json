      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting his wife's date of birth tattooed on him. The tattoo is supposed to represent his lineage from his parents down to his daughter. He didn't include his wife's DOB, which upset her and his mother. His mom agreed with his wife, thinking the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nHmm. The key here is communication and expectations. He mentioned the design was about his lineage and direct descendants. But his wife thought her DOB would be included, which he didn't plan on. It sounds like there was a misunderstanding. He didn't clearly communicate that the tattoo was from his side, not including his wife. His mother also didn't have tattoos, but she sided with the wife, maybe thinking the family tree should include both parents.\n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, if he didn't explain clearly that the tattoo was from his side (parents to him to his daughter), then maybe he's partially responsible. But if he made it clear it was his lineage, then maybe not. However, since his wife thought her DOB would be included, and he didn't clarify, that's a communication issue. Also, the daughter is the result of both parents, so excluding the wife's DOB might seem like it's not acknowledging her role. So maybe the guy didn't consider that perspective. But if he designed it that way intentionally, then maybe he's not wrong. But the fact that his mother, who he says has no tattoos, is siding with his wife suggests there's a cultural or social expectation to include both parents. So maybe he's in the wrong for not including her DOB, even if it's his tattoo. Alternatively, if it's his personal lineage, it's his choice. But causing hurt feelings might mean he's at least partially at fault for not explaining or considering his wife's feelings. So, is the answer A or B? It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe A because he didn't communicate well and the exclusion could be seen as disrespectful. But B if it's his right to choose. I'm leaning towards A.\n"
