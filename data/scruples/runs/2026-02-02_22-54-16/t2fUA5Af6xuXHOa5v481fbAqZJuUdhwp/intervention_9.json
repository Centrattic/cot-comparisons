      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not including his wife's birthday in a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and their daughter. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage. His wife expected her birthday to be included and was upset when it wasn't. His mother also sided with his wife, arguing that the daughter is a result of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is clear: the tattoo is about his direct lineage. He's listing his parents, then himself, then his daughter. He used Roman numerals for the order. The key point is whether the wife's birth date should be included in a lineage tattoo. The author didn't mention her DOB, but the wife assumed it would be there. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. Lineage typically refers to one's direct ancestors and descendants. The author's design includes his parents (ancestors), himself, and his daughter (descendant). The wife is his spouse, not a direct ancestor or descendant in the traditional sense. So from a lineage standpoint, her exclusion makes sense. However, in family terms, the daughter is a product of both parents, so it's logical that the mother would feel her inclusion is important.\n\nBut the author's stated purpose was lineage, not the entire family tree. The wife might have misunderstood the scope. The author might have failed to communicate clearly that the tattoo was about his own line, not the entire family. However, if he explicitly said it's about his lineage, then he's not wrong for excluding her. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction could stem from feeling excluded or not valued, even if the design is about lineage. The author's mother siding with the wife complicates things, but that's more about the family dynamics than the author's decision. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for designing the tattoo as he intended. However, there's a communication aspect\u2014maybe he should have discussed it more with his wife to avoid hurt feelings. But the core question is whether he's in the wrong for the design choice itself. Since lineage typically doesn't include a spouse, and the author made that clear, his choice isn't wrong. The wife's expectations were perhaps based on a different understanding of what a family tattoo entails. So the answer is B.\n"
