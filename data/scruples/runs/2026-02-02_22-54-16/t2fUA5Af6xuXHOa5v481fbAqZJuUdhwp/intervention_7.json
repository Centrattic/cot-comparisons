My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo. Cuse I\u2019m having serious second thoughts about getting it done.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that shows his lineage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo design is his way of representing his lineage. He mentioned his parents, himself, and his daughter in Roman numerals. The wife expected her DOB to be included, but he didn't. He clarifies that the purpose is to show his lineage, which makes me think he's focusing on his direct descendants and ancestors.\n\nThe wife and his mother are upset because they see the daughter as a product of both parents. But the author's design only includes his side. The question is whether he's wrong for excluding his wife's DOB.\n\nI need to consider boundaries and communication. Did the author clearly explain the purpose of the tattoo to his wife? If he explicitly said it's about his lineage and not a family tree, then maybe he's not at fault. However, maybe the wife felt her inclusion was important, and the author didn't consider that perspective.\n\nBut the author's design is a personal choice. He's tattooing his own body, so the decision should be his. The wife might feel left out, but that's more about their relationship dynamics rather than the author being wrong. The mother's side with the wife could be adding pressure, but the author's right to his own design shouldn't be in question.\n\nSo, unless there was a prior agreement or mutual decision to include the wife, the author isn't necessarily wrong. It's about personal expression. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
