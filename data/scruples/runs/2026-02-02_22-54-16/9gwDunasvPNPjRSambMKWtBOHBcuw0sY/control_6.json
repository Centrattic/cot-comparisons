      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework because they pay more of the rent and utilities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house. His salary is double hers, so he pays more rent/utilities. She does cooking and cleaning. She's been getting irritable lately. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more chores because he pays more.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the financial contribution and the division of labor. The author is assuming that because he contributes more financially, he's entitled to less chores. But is that a fair assumption?\n\nI remember that in relationships, fairness can be subjective. What's fair to one person might not be to another. If the agreement was that she does the cooking and cleaning in exchange for him paying more, but now she's getting upset, maybe the arrangement isn't working anymore. Maybe her workload has increased, or she's feeling unappreciated. Alternatively, maybe he's taking on more and expects her to do even more without considering her feelings or workload.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been getting irritable suggests there's some underlying issue. Maybe she's overworked, or perhaps the chores aren't split equally in her eyes. The author's assumption that paying more means she should do more might not consider her perspective. It's possible that she's already doing the same amount but feels it's unfair, or maybe there are other factors like physical limitations, stress from work, etc.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require communication and mutual understanding. If the author hasn't discussed the recent irritability or tried to adjust the chores, he might be assuming the old arrangement automatically applies now without considering changes. Maybe their circumstances have changed, and a reassessment is needed.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, expecting someone to do chores just because you pay more might not be fair if that's not how both parties agree. The problem here is that the author is making an assumption based on financial contribution without considering her feelings. The fact that she's irritable indicates that the current setup isn't working for her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not adjusting or communicating about the changes.\n\nBut then again, some people might think splitting chores based on financial contribution is fair. But the key is whether both parties agree. Since she's getting irritated, it's a sign that the arrangement isn't agreed upon anymore. So, he's in the wrong for not recognizing her feelings and not adjusting the chores accordingly.\n"
