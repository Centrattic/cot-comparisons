      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been in a relationship for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house, pays more for utilities because his salary is double his girlfriend's, and she does the cooking and cleaning. Now she's getting irritable about chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The arrangement has worked for two years, but now there's tension. The man's logic is that since he contributes more financially, he expects her to handle more chores. But is that a valid assumption? In many relationships, fairness isn't just about financial contributions. Emotional labor, personal preferences, and mutual respect play roles. \n\nThe fact that he owns the house and pays more might make him feel he's contributing more, but relationships aren't a transactional equation. Expecting someone to do chores based on financial input can be problematic. It might overlook the emotional and physical labor involved in housework. Also, the girlfriend's irritation suggests that the current division isn't satisfying her, which means the arrangement might need renegotiation rather than sticking to the original deal.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend might feel undervalued or taken for granted. If she's doing all the cooking and cleaning, even if she's being compensated through lower rent, she might feel it's unfair or unbalanced. The man's perspective is based on his financial contribution, but he's not considering her feelings or workload. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might expect traditional roles, modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibilities and communication. The key issue here is whether the current arrangement is still meeting both partners' needs. The fact that she's becoming irritable indicates it's not. The man should probably reflect on why he expects her to do more and whether the financial arrangement alone justifies that expectation. \n\nMoreover, the duration of the relationship (8 years) suggests that things might have changed over time. Maybe her workload has increased, or her personal circumstances have shifted, leading to her irritation. The man should communicate with her to understand her perspective instead of doubling down on the existing arrangement. \n\nIn conclusion, the man might be in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the evolving nature of the relationship. The assumption that financial contributions should directly translate to reduced domestic responsibilities is flawed. A healthy relationship requires mutual adjustment and empathy, not a rigid transactional model.\n"
