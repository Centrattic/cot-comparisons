      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about household responsibilities based on financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together 8 years, live together, and the man owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. The girlfriend does cooking and cleaning. This has been fine for two years, but now she's irritable. The author is wondering if he's at fault for expecting her to handle housework since he contributes more financially.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But I need to consider fairness in chores. In many relationships, contributions can be both financial and domestic. Just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean she should do all the chores. It's possible that the workload is unbalanced, leading to her irritation. Maybe the author expects her to take on more than her fair share, not considering her feelings or the emotional labor involved. Also, the fact that she's irritable suggests the arrangement isn't sustainable. So, even if the initial setup was agreed upon, the current situation might require a reassessment. The author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her feelings and the need for a more balanced division of labor. So, answer A.\n"
