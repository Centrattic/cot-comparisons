      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The key points here are the financial contributions and the division of household chores.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house and pays more in rent/utilities because his salary is twice his girlfriend's. They've been together for 8 years and this arrangement has worked for two years. Now, the girlfriend is getting irritable about the chores. The author is thinking she should do more because he pays more. \n\nSo, the question is whether expecting someone to do chores based on financial contributions is fair. I need to consider societal norms, but also the context of a long-term relationship. In many relationships, especially where one partner earns more, there can be an informal agreement about chores. But expectations can vary. \n\nThe author might believe that since he contributes more financially, it's fair for the other to handle more domestic work. However, some people might argue that chores should be shared equally regardless of income. The fact that they've been together for 8 years suggests they might have established a routine, but recent irritability from the girlfriend indicates this arrangement isn't working anymore. \n\nI should also consider if there's any implicit or explicit agreement about chores. If it was a mutual understanding before, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the girlfriend now feels that it's unfair, the author might need to reassess. \n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend's irritability stems from feeling overburdened or undervalued, especially if her share of chores has increased without acknowledgment. The author's reasoning is based on financial contribution, but emotional labor and fairness in chores can be subjective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be in the wrong initially, the current situation shows that the arrangement is causing tension. The key is whether both parties are comfortable with the arrangement. If the girlfriend is now unhappy, the author should communicate and adjust rather than sticking to the initial expectation. So, maybe the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her current feelings and needs, even if the initial setup was fair.\n"
