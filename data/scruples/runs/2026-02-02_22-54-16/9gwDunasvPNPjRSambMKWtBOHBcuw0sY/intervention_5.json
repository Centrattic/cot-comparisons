      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, which is in his name. His salary is about twice hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement has worked for two years, but recently she's been getting irritable about the chores. The author is wondering if it's his fault for expecting her to do more housework since he covers more of the expenses.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author pays more because he earns more and owns the house. He expects her to handle the cooking and cleaning as part of the household responsibilities. The issue is that she's becoming irritable, so maybe the arrangement isn't fair or sustainable anymore.\n\nIn relationships, fairness and communication are crucial. Even if there's an exchange of money for chores, expectations can change over time. The author might be assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But in reality, relationships often require mutual effort beyond just splitting chores based on income. Emotional labor, for example, isn't always accounted for in such arrangements.\n\nAlso, the idea that chores should be distributed based on income might not be fair. Cooking and cleaning are part of maintaining a household, and expecting someone to do all of it could be seen as unfair, especially if the other person isn't willing or has other responsibilities. The author might be taking for granted that she's doing her part, but if she's getting irritable, maybe the workload is too much or there's a lack of appreciation.\n\nAnother angle is that the arrangement has been working for two years, but now she's changing. The author might need to revisit the agreement and see if there's a new dynamic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do the chores. If the initial agreement was mutual, then he's not necessarily wrong. But if the expectation is based on a transactional view (money for chores) without considering her feelings or workload, he might be contributing to her stress.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The user might see that the author is trying to balance the financial contributions with household responsibilities. However, relationships require balance in many aspects beyond just splitting chores. If the author is not doing any chores and relying solely on her, even if she's doing it in exchange for financial support, that could be seen as unfair. Maybe the author isn't contributing equally in other ways, leading to her irritability.\n\nIn many relationships, both partners contribute to chores regardless of income. So expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning because he pays more might not be equitable. The author might be overlooking that emotional labor and household tasks are part of shared responsibilities. If he's not doing any chores, even if he pays more, it's not balanced. So in that case, he might be in the wrong for not contributing equally and expecting her to handle everything.\n\nOn the other hand, if the initial agreement was clear and mutual, and he's been fair in other ways, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that she's getting irritable suggests that the arrangement is causing tension. The key here is whether the expectation is reasonable. If he's not doing any chores and she's doing all, even if she's doing it in exchange for financial support, that could be the issue. It's possible that the author is not considering that she might need emotional support or that the chores are becoming a burden for her.\n\nSo, weighing these points, the author might be in the wrong if the expectation is that she must do all the chores just because he pays more. Relationships require mutual effort and consideration. The fact that she's irritable indicates that the current setup isn't working for her, and he might need to adjust his expectations. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes), he's in the wrong for expecting her to do all the chores based on financial contributions without considering her well-being or shared responsibilities.\n"
