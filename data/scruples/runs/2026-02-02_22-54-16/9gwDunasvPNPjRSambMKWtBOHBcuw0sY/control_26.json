      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author and their girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. The house is owned by the author, and it's in their name. The author makes about twice what the girlfriend does, so they pay more of the rent and utilities. In exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable about the chores. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since they pay more.\n\nFirst, I should consider if there's anything wrong with the author's reasoning. They think that since they contribute more financially, the girlfriend should handle more chores. But maybe this is an assumption based on traditional gender roles? Like, expecting a partner to do housework because the other pays more. That could be problematic because chores aren't always directly tied to income.\n\nAnother angle is that the arrangement worked for two years, but now there's a problem. The author might not be considering the girlfriend's feelings or the balance in the relationship. Even if the author pays more, housework isn't just about money. It's about shared responsibilities and mutual effort. Maybe the girlfriend feels overburdened or that the division isn't fair anymore.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in the author's name might contribute to feelings of ownership. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, it's important that both partners feel they're contributing in ways that feel equitable. If the author is insisting on the current setup without considering the girlfriend's changing feelings, that could be the issue.\n\nI should also think about communication. The author might not have discussed the recent irritability with the girlfriend, assuming that she should just keep doing her share. That lack of communication could be a problem. The author's expectation might not align with the girlfriend's current capacity or desires, leading to tension.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's assumption that paying more means the girlfriend must do more chores could be based on outdated or unfair expectations. Relationships require mutual consideration and adapting to each other's needs. The author might be in the wrong if they're not open to renegotiating responsibilities instead of sticking to an old agreement that's causing stress now.\n"
