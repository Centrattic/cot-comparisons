      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They live together, the author owns the house, and he earns twice her salary, so he pays more for rent and utilities. The girlfriend does the chores, but recently she's been irritable about it. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong by expecting her to take on more housework since he contributes more financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been together for eight years, which is a long time. They've established a routine where the author covers more of the financial responsibilities, and the girlfriend handles the domestic chores. This arrangement has worked for two years, but now there's tension. \n\nThe key points to analyze are the expectations each partner has. The author believes that because he pays more in rent and utilities, it's fair that the girlfriend does more housework. However, the girlfriend is now upset about this arrangement. The question is whether the author's expectation is reasonable or if he's being unfair.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing household chores is a mutual agreement based on what both partners are comfortable with. Just because someone contributes more financially doesn't automatically mean they should contribute less in other ways. However, some people might feel that the partner who pays more should also take on more responsibilities. \n\nBut here's the catch: the arrangement was working for two years. Now the girlfriend is irritable. This could indicate that the balance has shifted or that her expectations have changed. The author might not have considered that her willingness to take on chores might depend on other factors, like her own workload, stress levels, or unmet needs in the relationship that aren't related to chores. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that financial contribution should equate to less domestic work. However, household responsibilities are often seen as a shared duty regardless of financial input. If one partner is doing all the chores, it might lead to resentment, especially if the other isn't contributing in other non-monetary ways. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have discussed this arrangement openly with his girlfriend. If the setup was agreed upon initially, but now she's feeling it's unfair, the issue might be about adapting to new circumstances. The author's assumption that his financial contribution justifies expecting more from her could be the problem. Relationships require flexibility and understanding, so if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author might need to reassess the division of labor.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's financial contribution is significant, expecting the girlfriend to handle all chores based on that could be seen as unfair. The key is whether both partners feel the arrangement is equitable. Since the girlfriend is now upset, the author should consider her perspective and possibly adjust the division of responsibilities to maintain a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing her changing needs and for assuming that financial contribution alone justifies an unequal division of chores.\n"
