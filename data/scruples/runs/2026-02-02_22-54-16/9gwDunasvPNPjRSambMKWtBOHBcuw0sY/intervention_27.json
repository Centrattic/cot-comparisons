      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do cooking and cleaning, given that he pays more towards rent and utilities because his salary is higher. The girlfriend has been doing the chores, but recently she's been irritable. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house and pays more due to his higher income. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. The question is whether it's fair for the author to expect her to do more because he pays more.\n\nI know that fairness in relationships isn't just about splitting chores equally. It can depend on mutual agreement and what both parties are comfortable with. If they had an understanding that she would handle the chores in exchange for him covering more financial costs, then maybe it's a balanced arrangement. However, if the chores have increased beyond what she initially agreed to, or if she's feeling overburdened, that could be an issue.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of chores based on financial contributions. The author is assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is now feeling that the distribution is unfair or if there's been a change in circumstances (like her workload, health, or other responsibilities), the author might not have considered that.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been irritable lately suggests that the current arrangement might not be working for her. The author might need to address this by discussing with her, understanding her perspective, and possibly adjusting the chores or finding another way to share responsibilities. Maybe the chores have increased, or she feels taken advantage of despite the financial arrangement.\n\nAnother angle is that financial contributions and chores aren't necessarily directly proportional. Emotional labor, time management, and personal preferences also play a role. If the author is expecting her to do chores solely based on his financial input without considering her input, that could be problematic. Healthy relationships require open communication and flexibility.\n\nSo, while the author might not be wrong in thinking he's compensating by paying more, he might be wrong in not checking in with her and adjusting as needed. The answer here could hinge on whether the initial agreement was mutual and if both parties are still comfortable with it. If the arrangement was a mutual understanding and she's now changing her mind without discussion, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the arrangement was unspoken or if he's not considering her current feelings, then he might be at fault.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, it's traditional for one partner to handle more domestic chores, but in others, equality is emphasized. The answer might depend on the cultural context, but the question doesn't specify that. So sticking to general principles of fairness and communication in relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid point about contributing financially, he might be in the wrong if he's not considering her current feelings and the need for open dialogue. The answer might be A (yes) because expecting her to do more chores solely based on financial contributions without mutual agreement or discussion could be unfair. Alternatively, if the arrangement was agreed upon and she's now being inconsistent, it might be B (no). But since she's showing irritation, the author should reassess, which suggests he might be in the wrong for not adjusting.\n"
