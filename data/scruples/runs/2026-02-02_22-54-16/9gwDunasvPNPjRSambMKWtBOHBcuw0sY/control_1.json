      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent and utilities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The author owns the house, and his salary is twice hers. He pays more towards rent and utilities, so she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more housework since he pays more.\n\nHmm, well, relationships often require mutual effort and communication. Even if one person pays more, chores aren't always about splitting them based on income or who owns the place. Maybe the author assumes she should take on more because he's contributing financially, but that might not be fair if she's not comfortable with that arrangement now. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's getting irritable suggests there's some tension. The author might be expecting her to continue doing all the chores without considering her feelings or workload. Maybe they need to reassess how responsibilities are divided, considering both emotional labor and physical chores. \n\nThe key here is that the arrangement was working before, but now there's a change in her feelings. The author might not be in the wrong initially, but if he's not addressing her irritation and instead doubling down on his expectation, that's problematic. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for thinking she needs to do more. \n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, people share chores regardless of income. So expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning just because he pays more might not be fair. The author might not realize that emotional and domestic labor should be shared, not just based on financial contribution. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's assumption that she should do more because he pays more is likely where the issue lies. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her feelings and the imbalance in household responsibilities beyond finances.\n"
