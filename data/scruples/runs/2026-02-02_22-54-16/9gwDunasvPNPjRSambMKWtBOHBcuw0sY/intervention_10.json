      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house and pays more in rent and utilities due to a higher salary. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, but recently she's been irritable about it. The author wonders if they're wrong to expect her to do more because they pay more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. The author's logic is that since they contribute more financially, the girlfriend should take on more domestic duties. But relationships aren't always about splitting chores based on income. There's also the aspect of time, energy, and personal preferences to consider. \n\nIn many relationships, people split chores based on what makes sense for both, not necessarily in proportion to income. If one person has more free time or prefers cooking, they might do it without it being a problem. However, if the girlfriend is now feeling overburdened, even if the author pays more, it's important to communicate and adjust. \n\nThe fact that the situation has worked for two years but is now causing irritation suggests that there might be a shift in their circumstances or feelings. The author might need to reassess the balance. Justifying based on financial contribution could lead to resentment if the other person feels it's unfair. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship (8 years) might imply that expectations could have evolved. Maybe the girlfriend is taking on more than she feels comfortable with now, which the author isn't noticing. The key point is that the arrangement should be mutually agreeable. If the girlfriend is unhappy, the author should address it rather than assume they're right.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is open to discussion and adjustment. If they're rigidly sticking to the idea that financial contribution equates to more chores for the other, that could be where the issue lies. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the arrangement was agreed upon and both were okay with it, but given the recent irritation, maybe the author should reconsider. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the girlfriend hasn't communicated her feelings clearly, the author might not be at fault yet. But if the author is being inflexible, that could make them wrong. Hmm.\n"
