      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, he owns the house, pays more in rent/utilities because his salary is twice hers, and she does the chores. Now she's getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's right to think she should do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-term partnership, but not married. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might influence expectations. But in a healthy relationship, fairness isn't just about splitting chores based on who pays more. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's contributions.\n\nThe key point here is that the user is assuming she should do more because he pays more. But in many relationships, housework isn't split proportionally to income or who pays the bills. It's often about what each person is comfortable with and what they can contribute. The fact that she's been doing it for two years and now is getting irritable suggests that maybe the arrangement isn't sustainable or fair for her anymore.\n\nAlso, even though he pays more, she might feel that her emotional labor or time is being undervalued. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle, or perhaps she's not being appreciated enough. The user's reasoning might be based on an assumption that financial contribution equals responsibility for chores, which isn't necessarily a fair standard in a relationship. Relationships require communication and negotiation, and expecting her to do more without considering her feelings or capacity could be the root of the problem.\n\nAnother angle: if they've been together for eight years, their roles might have become habitual. She might feel trapped or unappreciated. The user's focus on compensating through chores might not account for her current stress or other responsibilities. It's possible that the user isn't considering her perspective and is rigidly sticking to an old agreement without checking in on how she's feeling.\n\nIn summary, the user's assumption that she should do more because he pays more might be the issue. Relationships require flexibility and empathy. If she's irritable, it's a sign that the current arrangement isn't working for her. The author might be in the wrong for not communicating and adjusting to her needs instead of maintaining the status quo based on financial contributions alone.\n"
