      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they've been together 8 years and live together. The man owns the house, and his salary is double hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable about the chores, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial contributions versus household responsibilities. He's paying more because he earns more, and she's taking care of the chores. But now she's unhappy. The question is whether he's wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. Some people think chores should be split equally regardless of income, while others see it as a trade-off. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might be seen as him contributing significantly to the household's financial stability. On the other hand, expecting her to handle all the chores could be seen as not sharing the domestic workload fairly, especially if her contributions are making her stressed or irritable.\n\nI need to consider common perspectives. If the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and both were happy two years ago, maybe it's just changing circumstances. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle now. But he's thinking she should do more because he pays more. That might seem like he's not sharing the workload but using his higher income as a reason to expect her to do more, which could be unfair.\n\nAlso, in many relationships, chores are considered shared responsibilities. Even if one partner pays more, the other might not be obligated to do all the chores. The assumption that higher financial contribution justifies more chores might not hold, as emotional labor and physical chores are important too.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's expecting a disproportionate amount of chores based on his financial input, which isn't necessarily a fair or balanced approach. Relationships often require mutual effort and communication about expectations, not just transactional exchanges based on income.\n"
