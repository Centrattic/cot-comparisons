      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is double hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. She does the chores as compensation, but lately she's irritable.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Let's break it down. The key points are the financial contributions versus the household chores. The author pays more because he earns more, so expects her to handle chores. But she's getting upset. \n\nFirst, fairness in relationships can be subjective. If they had a mutual agreement where her chores compensate for his higher payments, that's one thing. But if she's now feeling burdened, maybe the arrangement isn't balanced anymore. The author's reasoning is based on financial contributions, but chores aren't just about money\u2014they\u2019re about mutual effort and respect. \n\nAlso, maybe the author isn't considering her feelings. If she's irritable, it could mean the current setup isn't working for her. Expecting her to do all the chores because he pays more might be unfair if it's causing her stress. Relationships require communication and adjustment. The author might be assuming that their arrangement is static, but circumstances can change. \n\nSo, even if the initial deal made sense, if she's now unhappy, he should reconsider. It's not just about who pays what, but how both partners feel about the division of labor. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings and maintaining an unequal balance. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The user says the author isn't wrong, but I think the key is the impact on her well-being. So, A (wrong) because he's not considering her current irritation and maintaining an unequal division despite her discomfort.\n"
