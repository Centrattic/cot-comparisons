      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework since they pay more of the rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and lives together. The author owns the house, which is in their name, and their salary is twice the girlfriend's. They've had a system where she does the cooking and cleaning, which has worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable about the chores.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're at fault for expecting her to do more housework because they pay more. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. So, the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider common relationships advice. Many experts suggest that household responsibilities should be shared equally, regardless of income or ownership. The idea is that chores aren't about money but about maintaining a shared living space. Even if one person pays more, expecting the other to take on all the chores could be seen as unfair. The author's argument is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should do more, but that might not align with modern expectations of fairness in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in the author's name might add to the complexity. But ownership doesn't necessarily translate to who should do the chores. The key point is the irritation from the girlfriend. The system that worked for two years is now causing friction, which suggests that the arrangement might be unbalanced or that expectations have changed. \n\nSo, while the author might have a point about contributing financially, the emotional labor and physical labor of housework shouldn't be offset by money alone. Relationships often require compromise and discussion. The author's expectation might not consider the girlfriend's feelings or the mutual effort needed in maintaining a home. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not adjusting the arrangement and expecting more from her without considering her perspective. \n\nBut then again, if both agreed to the initial arrangement, maybe the issue is that the girlfriend's feelings have changed, and the author isn't adapting. The question is whether the author is wrong for maintaining their expectation. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for thinking that way, but they might need to communicate and find a new balance. However, the expectation itself could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn many cases, equal sharing of household duties is encouraged regardless of financial contributions. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the arrangement might be inequitable. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. But based on relationship advice, the answer is likely A.\n"
