      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for 8 years and they live together. He owns the house, and his salary is about twice hers. He pays more towards rent and utilities because of that. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's been getting irritable about the chores. The question is, is the author in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more?\n\nFirst thought: The user is assuming that because he pays more, she should take on more chores. But maybe he's not considering that their agreement was based on a fair split, and now she's unhappy. Maybe he's not acknowledging that her role in the household is also significant. \n\nSecond, the user's reasoning is that he contributes more financially, so she should do more chores. But chores aren't just about money; they're about shared responsibilities. Even if he pays more, maybe the workload is uneven. For example, if he's not contributing to other chores, that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's been getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her. The user might not be considering her feelings or the fact that her workload might be too much. Maybe he expects her to do all the cooking and cleaning, which is a lot, and she's feeling overburdened. \n\nAnother angle: The financial contribution is a factor, but housework isn't just a transaction. There's emotional labor involved as well. If he's not helping with other tasks, even if he pays more, it's unfair. \n\nMoreover, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If he expects her to do more because he pays more, he's not seeing housework as a shared responsibility. Even if he pays more, splitting chores is about maintaining a balanced relationship. \n\nWait, but maybe their original agreement was that she does the cooking and cleaning in exchange for him covering more of the bills. If that was the deal, and she's now not fulfilling her part, she might be in the wrong. But the problem is, he's not helping with chores, so maybe he's not contributing enough. \n\nBut the key point here is that the user is questioning if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more. If he's not contributing his fair share of chores, then he might be the one at fault. Because even if he pays more, expecting her to do all the chores is unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not sharing the chores equally and is instead expecting her to do more based on his financial contribution, which is not a fair approach. Relationships require mutual effort in chores regardless of financial contributions.\n"
