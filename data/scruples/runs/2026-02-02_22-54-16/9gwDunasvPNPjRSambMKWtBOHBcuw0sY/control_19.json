      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on the fact that he pays more for rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years and live in a house he owns, with his salary being twice hers. He covers more of the rent and utilities, and in exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked well for two years, but now she's becoming irritable about the chores.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, expecting someone to do chores because you pay more might be a traditional view, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual agreement. The key here is whether there's an explicit or implicit agreement. If they both agreed that he handles the financials and she the chores, then maybe it's not inherently wrong. But if the expectation is based on unequal pay and she's now feeling overburdened, that could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle: just because he pays more doesn't necessarily mean she should do all the chores. Housework can be a shared responsibility regardless of income. The fact that she's been doing it for two years without complaint but now is getting irritable might indicate that the arrangement is becoming unsustainable or unfair from her perspective. Maybe the workload has increased, or the division isn't balanced anymore.\n\nAlso, considering that he owns the house solely, that might add to the perception of him being the primary provider, but it's not a given that this justifies her doing all the chores. Relationships require communication. If he hasn't discussed this with her and is making assumptions, that could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings or if the chores are unfair.\n\nIn summary, the fairness of the situation depends on mutual understanding. If the arrangement was agreed upon and is still acceptable to both, then he's not wrong. However, since she's now expressing dissatisfaction, expecting her to continue without considering her feelings could make him wrong. The answer hinges on whether the expectations are mutual and if there's open communication.\n"
