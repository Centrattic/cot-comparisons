      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who have been living together for 8 years, with the man owning the house and having a higher salary. The girlfriend handles cooking and cleaning, but she's now getting irritable. The author is asking if he's at fault for expecting her to do more housework since he contributes more financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so their roles might have been established through mutual agreement. The man pays more in rent and utilities, and she does the chores. That system worked for two years, but now she's unhappy. The key question is whether the distribution of chores is fair or if the man is being unreasonable.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, there's often an expectation that the person earning more might take on more financial responsibilities, and the other partner might handle domestic tasks. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities, regardless of income. The problem here is that the author is assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But maybe the issue is that the chores aren't being shared equally, or perhaps she's taking on more than just cooking and cleaning, leading to her irritation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on a trade-off: financial contribution in exchange for domestic work. But that might not be the healthiest or most equitable approach. In many relationships, both partners contribute in ways that might not be directly proportional to their income. If the woman is feeling overburdened, it might not be fair to expect her to continue doing so just because he pays more. Also, their salaries are in a 2:1 ratio, which could mean the man contributes a significant portion of the expenses, but that doesn't necessarily mean the chores should be split in the same ratio. Chores are often split 50/50 in many couples, regardless of income.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that she's becoming irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her. The author is expecting her to continue the same chores, but maybe she's feeling unappreciated or overworked. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and the actual workload she's handling. It's possible that chores like cooking and cleaning are more time-consuming than he realizes, or perhaps there are other tasks he's not accounting for.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might imply a different kind of responsibility, but that doesn't necessarily translate to her doing more chores. Ownership and financial contribution don't inherently dictate domestic responsibilities. The key here is whether the arrangement is agreed upon and fair to both parties. If they haven't discussed it recently and her feelings are starting to show, then the author might be assuming a standard that isn't right for their specific situation.\n\nIn summary, the author's approach might be based on traditional roles or a transactional view of the relationship. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel that their contributions are valued and that the workload is shared in a way that's agreeable to both. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective and the emotional labor involved in household chores. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because expecting her to do more based solely on his financial contribution without considering her feelings or the actual equitable distribution of labor might not be fair.\n"
