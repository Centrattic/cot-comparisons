      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework because they pay more of the rent and utilities. They live together, have been for 8 years, and the author owns the house. The girlfriend's salary is half his, so he covers more of the expenses. She does the cooking and cleaning as compensation, but now she's irritable about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's fair to expect her to do more chores just because he pays more. Traditionally, some people might think splitting chores based on income makes sense, but modern relationships often emphasize equality regardless of financial contributions. The problem here is that the arrangement worked for two years but now she's unhappy. The key issue is whether the expectation is fair or if it's placing an unfair burden on her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should handle more chores. But this could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy in a relationship. Emotional labor and chores aren't always about splitting them proportionally to income. Relationships often require mutual respect and understanding, not just a trade-off. Also, the fact that the house is solely in his name might add to the imbalance, making her feel like she's working for the privilege of living there.\n\nOn the other hand, if both parties agreed to this arrangement and it was working, maybe it's not inherently wrong. However, the fact that she's now irritable suggests that the arrangement isn't meeting her needs anymore. The author might not be considering her feelings or the emotional aspect of the chores. It's possible that he's not in the wrong, but he's not considering her perspective properly. Alternatively, the arrangement might be unfair to begin with, making him in the wrong for expecting her to handle more just because he pays more.\n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, chores are shared regardless of who pays bills. If the author is using his higher income as a reason to assign more chores, it might be seen as a form of control or exploitation. Expecting her to do more because he pays more could be considered transactional and not based on mutual respect. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for setting that expectation.\n\nBut if both were okay with it initially, maybe not. However, since she's now upset, the author should reflect on whether his expectation is fair. The answer might depend on whether the arrangement was a mutual agreement or if it's an assumption based on his financial contributions. If it's the latter, he's in the wrong for imposing a system that doesn't consider her feelings or the emotional labor she's doing.\n"
