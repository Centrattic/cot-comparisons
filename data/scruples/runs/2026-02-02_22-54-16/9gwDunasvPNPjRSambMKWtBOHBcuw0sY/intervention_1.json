      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in the author's name, and he earns twice as much as his girlfriend. He pays more rent and utilities, so in return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the arrangement based on income and the current conflict. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. If the author's higher income leads him to pay more expenses, it might be seen as fair for him to contribute more to chores. However, expectations can vary. If the girlfriend feels overburdened or the workload isn't balanced despite the financial agreement, that could cause resentment. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should take on more chores. However, housework isn't just about money; it's also about mutual respect and shared responsibility. Even if the financial split is unequal, emotional labor and physical chores should ideally be shared. If the author is expecting her to do more because he pays more, maybe he's not considering that his contribution in finances doesn't absolve him of household responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her. Maybe the author needs to reassess and communicate better. If the arrangement was agreed upon mutually before, then it's his fault if he's not adjusting when things change. Alternatively, if the agreement was implicit and not discussed, his assumption might be the issue. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing chores is about teamwork, not just offsetting expenses. The author might be assuming a transactional approach, but relationships often require more than that. If he's not taking on his fair share of chores regardless of payment, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, even though he's paying more, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning could be seen as him not contributing equally in other areas. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because the balance isn't about money but about mutual effort. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the initial arrangement was clear and if expectations were mutual.\n"
