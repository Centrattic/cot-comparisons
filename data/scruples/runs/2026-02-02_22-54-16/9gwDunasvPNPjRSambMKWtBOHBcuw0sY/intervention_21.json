      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house and pays more due to his higher salary. The girlfriend does the chores, but recently she's been irritable.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether expecting her to do more because he pays more is fair. At first glance, maybe the user's thinking is that since he contributes more financially, she should handle more chores. But that's a common viewpoint. On the other hand, some might argue that chores aren't about money and that fairness in work should be balanced regardless of who pays more. \n\nWait, but the user's reasoning is that the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning as compensation for him paying more. That was an agreement that worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable. Is the author in the wrong for expecting her to continue? Maybe the issue is that the arrangement might be causing her stress, and the author isn't considering her feelings or workload. \n\nBut maybe the author is just maintaining the existing arrangement because it worked before. If the girlfriend's irritability is new, maybe there's an underlying issue. The author might need to communicate better instead of just expecting her to keep doing the same. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nCultural norms vary. Some people believe in splitting chores equally, others adjust based on financial contributions. If the arrangement was a mutual agreement and the girlfriend is now unhappy, maybe the author should reassess. But if he's not forcing her and the arrangement was mutual, then he's not necessarily wrong. But maybe the fact that he's expecting her to do more because he pays more is assuming she should compensate, which might not be fair. \n\nAlternatively, if the chores are all on her and causing her stress, even if he pays more, it's a different kind of imbalance. Maybe the author should consider her mental load and not just physical chores. So in that case, he might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her workload beyond the visible chores. \n\nBut the user's answer is B (not in the wrong), so I need to see if that's accurate. The key points: mutual agreement, worked for two years, now she's irritable. The author's stance is that since he pays more, she should do more. But if the arrangement is causing her distress, maybe the author should adjust. However, if the arrangement was clear and mutual, then he's not wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the chores were agreed upon as a trade-off and if the author is willing to adjust. If he's insisting on the same chores despite her being upset, that's where the issue could be. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting it. If the arrangement was mutual, maybe not. But if he's not considering her current situation, maybe he is. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the setup was mutual and based on financial contributions. However, the fact that she's now irritable might mean he needs to adjust, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about what he should do next. So in terms of right or wrong, if the agreement was mutual, he's not wrong. But if the chores are causing her stress, maybe he should adjust. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about being a good partner. \n\nSo the answer would be B.\n"
