      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, pays more rent because his salary is double hers. She does the chores, but recently she's been irritable. The author thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. The user pays more because he earns more, and she does the chores. That's a common arrangement in some households. But maybe the problem is that she's getting overwhelmed or not comfortable with the division anymore. The key here is whether expecting her to do chores based on financial contribution is fair.\n\nBut wait, chores aren't just about money. Emotional labor and physical labor are part of it. Even if he pays more, she might feel it's an unfair distribution of labor. Also, over 8 years, maybe the dynamics have changed. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle, or feels unappreciated. The author is expecting her to continue, but her irritation suggests that the current setup isn't working for her anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expecting her to do the chores. If the arrangement was mutual and agreed upon, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she's now expressing discomfort and he's not considering her feelings, that could be a problem. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might be his reasoning, but relationships require mutual respect and consideration for each other's well-being.\n\nSo, is it fair to base chores solely on financial contributions? Some might argue that chores are separate from money, and both should share equally unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. If the agreement was made, then maybe it's okay. But if she's now struggling, he should listen instead of insisting she continues. The key here is her well-being and communication. If he's not open to discussing a new arrangement, that could be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. What matters is both parties feeling respected and heard. If he's ignoring her irritation and sticking to the previous arrangement, he might be in the wrong. The answer might be A (he's wrong) because he's not addressing her concerns and maintaining the same dynamic despite her discomfort.\n"
