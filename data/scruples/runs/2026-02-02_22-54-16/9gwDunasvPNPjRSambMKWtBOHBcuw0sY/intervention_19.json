      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Here's the situation:\n\nThey've been together 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. His salary is double his girlfriend's, so he pays more towards rent/utilities. In exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. That worked for two years, but now she's irritable about chores. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he covers more costs.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether that's the case.\n\nKey points: The arrangement was based on the author's financial contribution. The author pays more, so she does the chores. Now she's unhappy. The question is about fairness in expectations.\n\nBut wait, is this a fair exchange? Cooking and cleaning are household chores that benefit both. If the author expects her to do all the work because he pays more, is that reasonable? Maybe there's an imbalance here. Housework isn't just about who pays what; it's about shared responsibility. Even if one person contributes more financially, splitting chores might be necessary for both to have a comfortable home.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she might be overburdened. If the author is expecting her to do all the housework while he doesn't contribute, that's unfair. Even though he pays more, contributing to chores is part of living together. It's possible the author isn't doing his share, leading to her resentment.\n\nAnother angle: The initial arrangement worked for two years, so maybe there was an agreement. But if her workload has increased or she's feeling it's too much now, the dynamic might need adjusting. The author might need to take on more chores himself instead of expecting her to do more. However, the author is focusing on her needing to do more because he pays more, which might be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, the author's assumption that her contribution should be based solely on his financial input might be the issue. Relationships require mutual effort beyond financial contributions. If the author isn't doing any chores, expecting her to do all of them because he pays more could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not contributing equally to housework despite his financial role.\n\nBut maybe the key factor is whether there was a mutual agreement. If they had an understanding where he handles the financial part and she the chores, and she agreed to that, then maybe it's okay. However, if the chores have become too much for her and she's feeling it's unequal, the author should reconsider. The problem is the author's expectation that she needs to do more because he pays more, which might not consider her current capacity or feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer could be A (author in the wrong) if the expectation is based solely on financial contribution without considering shared responsibilities. Alternatively, if the initial agreement was mutual and clear, then B (not in the wrong). But since the girlfriend is now irritated, the author's expectation might be contributing to the problem, making him in the wrong for not adjusting the arrangement when needed. So, likely A.\n"
