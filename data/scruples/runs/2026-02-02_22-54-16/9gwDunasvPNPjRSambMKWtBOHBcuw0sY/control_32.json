      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together where the man owns the house, pays more rent/utilities because his salary is double his girlfriend's. She does the cooking and cleaning. Lately, she's been irritable about chores, and the man is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's fair in a relationship regarding household chores. The man's argument is that since he pays more, the woman should do more chores. But chores aren't necessarily something that should be divided based on income or who owns the house. Relationships often require mutual effort regardless of financial contributions. \n\nThe woman's irritability might indicate that the current division isn't working for her. Even if he pays more, expecting her to take on all the domestic work could be seen as unequal. In many relationships, chores are shared to maintain harmony, not as a transaction based on who pays what. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years suggests that expectations might have been set a long time ago. If the dynamic has changed or the woman's feelings have evolved, the man should be open to adjusting. Assuming she needs to do more because of financial contribution might not consider her emotional labor or other contributions. \n\nSocietally, there's a shift towards more equality in household responsibilities regardless of income. So expecting her to do more just because he pays more might be unfair. The man's perspective could be outdated or not considering the balance needed for both partners' well-being. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the relationship's balance beyond financial contributions. The chores should be a shared responsibility unless both agree otherwise, and expecting her to do more solely because he pays more isn't fair.\n"
