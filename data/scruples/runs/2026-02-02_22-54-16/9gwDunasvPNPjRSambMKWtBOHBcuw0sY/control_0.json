      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend doing cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house, and his salary is twice his girlfriend's. He pays more towards rent and utilities, so she handles the housework. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable.\n\nThe key point here is the expectation of equal contribution. Just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean she should do all the chores. Relationships often require mutual effort beyond financial contributions. Maybe she feels like her work isn't valued, or the division of labor is unfair. Even if they had an informal agreement before, circumstances can change, and communication is crucial. The man might be assuming that the financial split justifies her doing all the chores, but that's not necessarily a given. It's possible she's taking on more emotional labor too, like planning meals or managing the household tasks. Also, considering their long-term partnership, expecting her to keep up with all the chores without discussion could be part of the issue. He needs to check in with her and find a balance that works for both, rather than sticking to an old arrangement that's causing tension now. So, he might be in the wrong for not being more open to adjusting their responsibilities.\n"
