      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, has a salary twice hers, pays more rent/utilities, and she does the cooking and cleaning. Now she's been getting irritable about chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so maybe there's an established routine. The author pays more because of higher income, and she does chores in compensation. That's been working for two years, but now she's upset. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants another opinion. The key points here are fairness in chores and communication. The author's reasoning is that since he covers more expenses, she should handle more housework. However, relationships aren't always about transactional fairness. Expecting someone to do chores based on financial contributions might not account for other factors like time, stress, or personal preferences. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests there's some underlying issue. Maybe the chores are too much, or she feels unappreciated. The author might need to communicate better rather than stick to the original agreement. Relationships require mutual respect and flexibility, especially as circumstances change. Even if there's an initial agreement, it's important to check in and adjust as needed. \n\nSo, while the author might not be outright wrong, there's a case to be made that he's not considering her current feelings and needs. The answer hinges on whether fairness is seen as transactional or based on mutual well-being. If the chores have become a source of stress for her, then expecting her to do more could be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings and maintaining the status quo without considering changes in her situation.\n"
