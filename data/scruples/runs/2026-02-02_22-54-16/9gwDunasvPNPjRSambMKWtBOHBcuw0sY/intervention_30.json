      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given that he owns the house and pays more towards rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. They've been together 8 years, live together, and the author owns the home. His salary is double hers, so he covers more of the expenses. The arrangement has been that she does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to continue doing more housework.\n\nI need to evaluate expectations in a relationship regarding domestic responsibilities. Traditionally, some people might expect the person earning more to take on more financial responsibilities, while others might expect a more equal division of chores regardless of income. However, relationships are personal, and what works for one couple might not for another.\n\nThe key points here are that the arrangement has been working for two years, but now there's a shift in her irritability. The author might be assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But maybe the issue is about fairness or changing circumstances. Over time, people's tolerance or capacity for chores might change, and maybe the balance needs readjustment.\n\nIs it fair to link chore distribution to financial contribution? Some might argue that chores are a shared responsibility regardless of income, while others might see it as a trade-off where the higher earner takes financial burden and the other takes on domestic tasks. But if the girlfriend is now feeling overburdened, the author might need to reconsider the arrangement instead of expecting her to continue as before.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking she should do more. If the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and working, maybe not. However, if the girlfriend is now unhappy, it's possible the author isn't considering her feelings or the potential for an imbalanced workload. The answer might hinge on whether the expectation is based on a prior agreement or an assumption that isn't being communicated.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a push towards equality in domestic tasks regardless of income. So expecting someone to do more chores just because you pay more might be seen as outdated. But if both parties agreed to this arrangement, then it's their choice. The problem arises when one party feels coerced or when the arrangement becomes unsustainable.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not open to renegotiating the division of chores, especially if the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The key issue is communication and mutual agreement. If the arrangement was okay before but now isn't, the author should be willing to adjust rather than maintain the same expectation.\n"
