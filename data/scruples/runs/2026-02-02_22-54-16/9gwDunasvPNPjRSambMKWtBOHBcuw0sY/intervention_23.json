      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent/utilities, and in exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. Now she's been irritable about it, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should handle the chores. But relationships aren't always about a strict quid pro quo. What's fair can depend on mutual understanding and communication. The fact that this arrangement worked for two years suggests it was acceptable before, but now there's a change in her feelings.\n\nThe key issue here is whether expecting someone to do chores based on financial contribution is inherently unfair. Some might argue that chores are a shared responsibility regardless of who pays how much. Others might see it as reasonable to divide tasks based on income. However, the fact that it's solely the author's house and he's the one with more income might influence perceptions. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the arrangement was working for two years. Now the girlfriend is irritable. That implies there's a shift in her feelings. Maybe the workload has increased, or she feels unappreciated. The author's expectation might not consider her emotional labor or the fact that expectations can change over time. \n\nAlso, the financial contribution isn't the only factor. Emotional support, time management, and personal preferences matter. If the chores are causing her stress, it's a problem. The author might need to reassess the balance rather than sticking to the original arrangement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not just about who pays more. Housework isn't a commodity to be traded. It's about partnership. If she's feeling overburdened, even if she's doing the same as before, the dynamic might need adjustment. The author's stance could be seen as rigid if he's not open to renegotiating the division of labor. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's possible. Expecting her to do all the chores just because he pays more might be an outdated or unfair assumption. Relationships require flexibility and empathy. The fact that she's now irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't meeting her needs. The author should consider her feelings and maybe share more responsibilities rather than maintaining the old agreement. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the arrangement, while perhaps acceptable before, isn't considering her current feelings and the evolving nature of their relationship.\n"
