      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together for 8 years and lives together. The author owns the house solely, and their salary is about double his girlfriend's. Because of this, he pays more of the rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but recently she's been getting irritable about the chores. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I should consider the fairness of the arrangement. The author pays more due to his higher income, so he's contributing more financially. The girlfriend handles the chores. This seems like a trade-off: money for labor. But maybe the issue is that the chores have increased, or she's feeling overburdened? The problem here is that the author believes she should do more because he pays more, but maybe she feels that's unfair or that the balance has shifted.\n\nIn relationships, expectations can change over time. What worked for two years might not work now. The girlfriend's irritability suggests she's unhappy with the current division of labor. The author might not be in the wrong initially, but if he's not acknowledging her feelings and is rigid about the arrangement, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to link chores directly to financial contributions? Some people might see chores as a shared responsibility regardless of who pays more. If the author is using his higher financial input as a reason to assign more chores, that could be seen as unfair, especially if it's causing tension. The key here is communication. If they haven't discussed the changing dynamics and the author is sticking to an old agreement without considering her current situation, he might be at fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years means their relationship has evolved. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle now, or there are other stressors. The author might need to reassess the household responsibilities and see if there's a way to share them more equitably, perhaps adjusting based on current circumstances rather than just financial contributions.\n\nSo, while the author's initial reasoning might seem logical (more money, more chores), if it's leading to conflict and he's not being flexible, he could be in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author is open to renegotiating the arrangement based on current needs and emotions rather than sticking to a fixed ratio. If he's not considering her feelings and the current situation, then he might be at fault.\n"
