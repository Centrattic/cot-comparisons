      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework, given that he pays more for rent and utilities. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is double hers. She does the cooking and cleaning. Lately, she's been irritable about chores. The author thinks she should do more because he pays more.\n\nI need to consider if expecting her to do more based on financial contribution is fair. Traditionally, some might argue that the person contributing more financially should have less chores, but that's a traditional view. Modern perspectives often emphasize equal sharing of household duties regardless of income.\n\nThe key points are the existing arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is maintaining the status quo but wants her to do more. But why the change? Maybe her workload increased, or she's feeling resentful about the division. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should do more. But this assumes that financial contribution directly translates to less responsibility, which isn't a given. Relationships often require compromise and mutual effort. If the chores are causing irritation, maybe the author hasn't considered her perspective or if the workload is balanced. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and pays more might imply he's the primary provider, but that doesn't necessarily mean the chores should fall to the other person. It's possible that the author isn't contributing enough to other areas, leading to her stress.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not just about who pays what. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. If the author is relying on her doing all the cooking and cleaning just because he pays more, that could be seen as unfair, especially if it's leading to her irritation. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that household responsibilities should be shared equitably, not based on income.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because expecting her to do more based solely on his higher financial contribution without considering her feelings or the balance of responsibilities is unfair.\n"
