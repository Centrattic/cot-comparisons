      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years, live in a house they own, and their salary is double the girlfriend's. They pay more rent/utilities, and in return, she does the chores. But now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider the dynamics here. Splitting chores based on financial contributions is a common arrangement. The author pays more, so expecting some household responsibilities from their partner makes sense. However, relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is now unhappy, maybe the balance has shifted or expectations have changed. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial setup seems fair, but maybe the girlfriend feels overburdened now. The key points are whether the arrangement was agreed upon and if there's been open communication. If the author hasn't adjusted when her workload increased or if there are other unspoken expectations, that could be an issue. However, based solely on the information given, the author's stance is reasonable. The problem might lie in the girlfriend's current dissatisfaction, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for upholding the previous agreement unless there's been a change in circumstances without discussion. So, I'd lean towards B.\n"
