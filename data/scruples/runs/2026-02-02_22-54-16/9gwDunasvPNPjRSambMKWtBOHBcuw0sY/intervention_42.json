      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But recently, she's been getting irritable about chores, and the author is wondering if he's wrong to expect her to handle more housework because he pays more.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). I need to answer just A or B. \n\nFirst, I should consider typical expectations in relationships. Usually, when one person pays more for the household, they might expect the other to contribute more in other areas, like chores. But this can vary based on cultural norms, individual agreements, and the specific dynamics of the relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that this arrangement has worked for two years, but now the girlfriend is irritated. The key here is whether the author's expectation is fair or if there's an imbalance. Since the author owns the house and his income is higher, it's common for the person contributing more financially to also take on more responsibilities. However, if the girlfriend feels overburdened, that's a red flag. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author is asking if he's wrong to expect her to do more. If the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and it was working before, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's irritation means the arrangement isn't fair now, maybe the author should adjust. But since the user is arguing the author isn't wrong, I have to consider if expecting her to do chores because he pays more is inherently unfair. \n\nIn many relationships, financial contributions don't always dictate domestic responsibilities equally. Some people feel that chores should be split equally regardless of income. Others see it as a trade-off. So, if the author and his girlfriend had an implicit agreement where she does chores in exchange for him paying more, then he's not wrong. But if the girlfriend is now unhappy, the author might need to revisit the agreement. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether the arrangement needs adjustment. \n\nSince the author isn't forcing her and the arrangement was working before, the answer might be B. Unless there's a cultural or social norm that dictates otherwise. But in the absence of coercion or an explicit agreement, the author might not be in the wrong. Also, considering that they live together and have an unspoken understanding, it's a shared responsibility, so maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the girlfriend is now overburdened, the author should listen to her, but that doesn't make him wrong for the expectation. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) unless there's a deeper issue like unequal contribution that's not addressed here. Since the user provided the context as is, and the author's reasoning is based on his financial contribution, the answer is B.\n"
