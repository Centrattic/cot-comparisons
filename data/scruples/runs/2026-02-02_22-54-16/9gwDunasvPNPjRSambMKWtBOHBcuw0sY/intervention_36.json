      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, earns twice her salary, pays more of the bills, and she does the chores. Now she's getting irritable, and the author wonders if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more because he pays more.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, which suggests they've had this arrangement for years. The key points are financial contributions versus household chores. The author thinks he's contributing more financially, so the chores should be her responsibility. The girlfriend is now upset about this arrangement.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the arrangement isn't equitable in her eyes anymore. Even if the author is paying more, relationships are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Just because he pays more doesn't necessarily mean she should do all the chores. Over time, people's feelings about work and fairness can change. Maybe she's taking on more than she's comfortable with, or maybe the division of labor isn't fair compared to his contributions. \n\nAlso, ownership of the house is in his name, which might add to the perception that he's the main provider. But in a healthy relationship, chores aren't just about who pays what. It's about teamwork. If he's expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning, even if he's paying more, that might be seen as unfair. She might feel she's contributing in another way, but the chores are taking up too much of her time or energy.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author isn't contributing enough in other ways. Maybe he's not doing any chores, so even though he's paying more, she's doing all the work. That could lead to resentment. The question is whether it's fair to assume that financial contribution justifies expecting someone else to handle all the household tasks.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. The answer hinges on whether expecting someone to do all chores because you pay more is reasonable. In many relationships, chores are split to balance the workload, not just based on income. So if the author isn't doing any chores and expects her to do it all, that's a problem. Even if he's paying more, shared responsibilities are important for a balanced relationship.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning might be based on a traditional gender role where the woman handles domestic tasks. But in modern relationships, this is often seen as unequal. The fact that she's been doing it for two years and now is irritable might indicate that this arrangement is no longer sustainable or equitable. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that chores aren't just about money but about shared effort.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting someone to do all the housework based on financial contributions without considering shared responsibilities and mutual effort is unfair.\n"
