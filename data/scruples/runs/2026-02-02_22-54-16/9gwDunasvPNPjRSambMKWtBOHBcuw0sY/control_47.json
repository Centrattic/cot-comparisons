      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, and his salary is twice hers. He pays more rent/utilities, so she does the housework. Lately, she's been irritable, and he wonders if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy pays more because he earns more, which makes sense. But expecting her to do all the cleaning and cooking because of that might be an issue. Traditional gender roles might come into play here. If they've been doing this for two years without issue, maybe it's a mutual agreement. But now she's irritable, so maybe the arrangement isn't working anymore.\n\nAlso, just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean she should handle all the chores. Relationship fairness isn't just about money; it's about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Even if he pays more, the chores could be split based on what each person can do, not just financial contribution. If he's not contributing in other ways, maybe that's causing her frustration. The key is communication. If the arrangement was agreed upon and he's sticking to it without considering her feelings now, he might be in the wrong. But if he's open to adjusting, maybe not. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now because she's upset. The answer likely leans towards AITA (A for Yes) because expecting her to do all chores solely based on his higher income could be seen as unfair, especially if she's feeling overburdened.\n"
