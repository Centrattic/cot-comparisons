      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in the man's name, and his salary is twice what his girlfriend makes. Because of this, he pays more of the rent and utilities, and in return, she handles the cooking and cleaning. This has been working for the last two years, but recently she's been getting irritable about the chores. The man is asking if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I should consider the setup. The man owns the house, pays more due to a higher salary, and expects his partner to handle certain chores. They had a mutual arrangement that worked for two years, but now there's some tension. \n\nI need to think about what's fair in a relationship. Typically, chores and responsibilities in a household shouldn't be based solely on who pays more. Even though he pays more, the expectation that she does all the cooking and cleaning might be seen as unequal. But maybe they had an agreement that worked for both. However, if she's now getting irritable, perhaps the balance is off. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the man's assumption that she should do more because he pays more is problematic. In many relationships, people share chores regardless of income or who owns the home. If she's feeling overburdened, even if she agreed to the setup before, her feelings now matter. The man might not be considering her current stress levels or if the workload is too much. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together 8 years\u2014maybe things have changed over time. The initial arrangement might not account for current circumstances. The man's perspective is that he's contributing more financially, so she should handle more domestic tasks. But emotional labor and physical labor are different. If she's doing all the cooking and cleaning, that's a significant amount of work, and if he's not contributing, even if he pays the bills, it's unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they had a mutual understanding, and she's now changing her stance without discussion. The key here is communication. If he hasn't checked in with her about how she feels and just expects her to keep doing it, that's a problem. The fact that she's irritable suggests she's not happy, so he should address it instead of justifying his position.\n\nSo putting it all together: The man's assumption that his financial contribution entitles him to less domestic work is likely the issue. Relationships ideally require mutual effort beyond financial contributions. The expectation that she does more because he pays more might be unfair, especially if it's causing her distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the imbalance in shared responsibilities.\n"
