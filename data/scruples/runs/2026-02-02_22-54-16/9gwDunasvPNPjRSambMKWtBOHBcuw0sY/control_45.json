      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong. The situation is about household responsibilities and finances.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house and pays more because his salary is twice his girlfriend's. She does the cooking and cleaning. Lately, she's been irritable about the chores. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. Well, relationships often involve shared responsibilities, but there's no one-size-fits-all. The man assumes that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But maybe she feels it's unfair or that the division isn't right. Maybe she's taking on more than she's comfortable with. Also, living arrangements and expectations can vary a lot. If they were in a more equal financial situation, maybe the chores would be split differently. But here, he's thinking it's fair because he contributes more financially. However, chores aren't just about money. Emotional labor, time, and personal preferences matter too. The key point is whether the current arrangement is consensual and fair to both. If she's getting irritable, maybe the expectations are unbalanced. The man might not be in the wrong if they had an agreement, but if she feels overburdened, he might not be considering her feelings. So, the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) if he's not being considerate of her feelings, or B if he's just following their initial agreement. But the problem is the recent irritation suggests the agreement isn't working anymore. So maybe AITA is on him because he's not adapting to her needs. But I'm not sure. Another angle: maybe he's not wrong because he's contributing more financially, so expecting her to handle chores is fair. But again, maybe that's a traditional view and not considering her perspective. In modern relationships, people often split chores equally regardless of income. So he might be in the wrong for not adjusting when she's unhappy. Hmm. Need to decide between A and B. I think the answer is A because expecting someone to do chores just because you pay more might be unfair, especially if it's causing stress. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
