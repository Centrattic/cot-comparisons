      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about household responsibilities. The author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is double hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable about the chores. He's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to continue with more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships. Traditionally, some might think that whoever pays more should manage more chores, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual agreement. The key here is whether the arrangement is fair and consensual.\n\nThe author mentions that the setup has worked for two years, so maybe there was an initial agreement. However, the girlfriend's recent irritability suggests she might feel the arrangement is unfair now. The author's assumption is that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But that's a traditional view that might not account for current relationship norms where shared responsibilities are often expected regardless of financial contributions.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's irritable indicates she's unhappy. The author is not considering her feelings here. Fairness in a relationship isn't just about splitting chores proportionally to income but about mutual respect and communication. The author should probably have a conversation to understand why she's upset instead of assuming she should continue as before. \n\nAnother point: the house is in his name, so he might have more financial stake, but that doesn't necessarily translate to her needing to do all the chores. Relationships are about partnership, and if one person is doing all the chores, it could be a sign of imbalance. The author's reasoning that he's in the right because he pays more is outdated and doesn't account for the emotional labor and the mutual benefits of a balanced partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not addressing the partner's feelings and maintaining a balanced, communicative approach to household responsibilities. The arrangement should be based on mutual agreement and fairness, not just financial contributions.\n"
