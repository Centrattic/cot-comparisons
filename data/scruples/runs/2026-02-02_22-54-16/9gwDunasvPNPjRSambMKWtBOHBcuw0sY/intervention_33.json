      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do most of the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live in a house he owns and pays for more, and she does the chores. Now she's getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to keep doing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so maybe this arrangement was established earlier. The man owns the house and pays more, which is a significant financial contribution. He argues that she's compensating by doing the chores. But now she's upset, suggesting that maybe the arrangement isn't fair or is causing tension.\n\nI should think about what factors contribute to fairness in relationships. Financial contributions versus domestic labor. Some might say that if he's paying for the majority of the expenses, it's reasonable to expect her to handle the chores. Others might argue that chores are a shared responsibility regardless of financial contributions, and that expecting her to do all of it could be unfair, especially if she's contributing in other ways.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The post mentions that she's been irritable lately. That could indicate that the arrangement is no longer working for her, so maybe the problem isn't whether the initial arrangement was fair, but that there's a lack of communication about changing expectations. The man might not be wrong in his expectation, but he could be wrong in not addressing her feelings or adjusting the arrangement if needed.\n\nAlso, societal norms play a role. In many cultures, there's a shift towards more equal sharing of domestic duties, regardless of financial contributions. So even if the man is paying more, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning might not align with current expectations of equality. However, it's a personal relationship, and what works for one couple might not for another. If both were happy with the arrangement before, maybe the issue is recent changes or unmet needs.\n\nThe key here is whether the arrangement is causing harm or dissatisfaction. The fact that she's irritable suggests that the current setup isn't making her happy. The man's perspective is that he expects her to continue, but if her well-being is affected, that might be a problem. Even if the arrangement was fair initially, it might need re-evaluation now.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her feelings and is rigid about the arrangement despite her showing distress, that could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, if he's trying to maintain a balance based on his financial input and hasn't done anything actively harmful, maybe not. The answer might hinge on whether he's being inconsiderate now that she's upset. Since the question is about AITA, the focus is on whether his actions are wrong, not just the outcome. If he's not adapting to her needs and is maintaining an unfair system, he might be in the wrong. If he's just following an agreed-upon arrangement and she's now changing her mind without discussion, perhaps not. But without clear communication, it's hard to say. The answer might be B (No), because the initial arrangement could be seen as fair, but the fact that he's not addressing her current irritability might make him at fault. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer leans towards A (Yes) because he's expecting her to do the chores without considering her current feelings and the imbalance in workload, even if financially he's contributing more. Equality in household duties is often considered important regardless of finances. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not adjusting when she's clearly upset.\n"
