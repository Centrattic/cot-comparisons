      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who've been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house and pays more for rent and utilities because his salary is twice his girlfriend's. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the division of household chores. The man thinks since he pays more, she should do more chores. But she's getting upset. The question is whether he's wrong for that expectation.\n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. Even though he pays more, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning might not be fair. Equality in chores isn't always about splitting evenly; it's about mutual respect and consideration. If she's doing all the chores, maybe he's not contributing enough. Also, the fact that she's irritable suggests that the arrangement is causing her stress. \n\nAnother angle is that financial contributions don't necessarily dictate domestic responsibilities. People might expect some reciprocity, but it's not always a direct trade-off. The man might be assuming traditional gender roles here, expecting her to handle all the housework, which could be a problem if that's not what she's comfortable with.\n\nMoreover, the couple has been together for a long time, so communication is key. If there's a shift in her feelings, he should address it by talking to her, not just assuming she should do more. His reasoning might be based on old assumptions that aren't working now.\n\nSo, the answer would be AITA (Am I the Asshole) depends on whether his expectation is unfair. Since the arrangement that worked before is causing her stress, he's not considering her feelings now. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not adjusting to her needs and is making assumptions based on payment.\n"
