      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. He earns twice what his girlfriend does, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's at fault for expecting her to keep doing more housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The fact that he owns the house might mean he has more responsibility, but he's already compensating by paying more. The key point is the exchange: he pays more, she does the chores. This seems like an informal agreement. But now she's getting upset. Why?\n\nMaybe the workload has increased, or her expectations have changed. The original arrangement worked for two years, but now she's irritable. The author is thinking she should continue doing the same chores because he pays more. But is that fair?\n\nI should think about fairness in relationships. In many relationships, chores are split based on what each person can do, not necessarily tied to income or who pays more. If the chores are becoming too much for her, maybe the author needs to adjust. Even though he pays more, expecting her to handle all the cleaning and cooking might be placing an unequal burden. \n\nAlso, communication is important. If she's irritable, maybe she needs more help, and the author should step in rather than expecting her to keep doing all the work. The fact that he's asking if he's at fault suggests he's aware that the situation might not be equitable anymore. \n\nAnother angle: societal norms. In some cultures, it's traditional for one partner to handle certain chores, but times are changing. If the relationship is modern, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning could be seen as old-fashioned and unfair. \n\nThe fact that he owns the house might mean he's responsible for maintenance, but that's separate from day-to-day chores. Cooking and cleaning are part of daily life, and if she's doing all of that, it's possible the workload isn't balanced. \n\nSo, even though he pays more, the chores shouldn't be solely her responsibility. The author might be in the wrong if he's not adjusting the chores as needed. The key is mutual effort and adjustment. If she's struggling, he should help more, not expect her to keep up just because he pays more. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the arrangement isn't balanced and he's not considering her current feelings or workload. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the original agreement was fair, but now circumstances have changed, he should adapt. So, the answer could be A.\n"
