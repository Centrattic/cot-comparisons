      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on the financial contributions. \n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and lives in a house owned solely by the author. The author earns twice as much as the girlfriend and pays more towards rent and utilities. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, which has worked for two years but recently she's been getting irritable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should take on more chores. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants validation. \n\nNow, I need to consider factors like fairness in chores, communication, and expectations. In a relationship, contributions aren't just financial. While the author contributes more monetarily, household chores are another form of contribution. However, if the arrangement was agreed upon and has been working, maybe the issue now is that the girlfriend feels the balance has shifted or that her contributions aren't valued.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is leaning towards B (not in the wrong). The author's reasoning is based on the financial contribution, which is a common argument. However, relationships often require mutual effort beyond just splitting expenses. If the chores were agreed as a trade-off, then maybe it's fair. But if the girlfriend feels overburdened or the author isn't considering her feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nThe problem arises if the author is rigidly enforcing the chore division without considering the girlfriend's feelings or if there's a lack of communication. The author might not be in the wrong if the arrangement was clear, but if they're not acknowledging her irritability or not being flexible, that could be a problem. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the expectation itself, not for not addressing the irritability. \n\nIn many relationships, there's an understanding of shared responsibilities. If the girlfriend was okay with the arrangement before, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the girlfriend's irritability indicates that the arrangement isn't fair anymore, the author might need to adjust. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the expectation. Since the author's reasoning is based on their financial contribution, which is a common basis for dividing chores, the answer might still be B. However, some might argue that chores should be shared regardless of income, making A the answer. But the user initially thinks B, so I need to see which is more justified here.\n"
