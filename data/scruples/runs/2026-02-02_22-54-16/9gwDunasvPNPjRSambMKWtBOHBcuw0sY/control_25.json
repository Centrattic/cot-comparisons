      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about household responsibilities and finances.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and lives together. The man owns the house, and his salary is twice his girlfriend's. He pays more for rent and utilities, so she does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been irritated about her chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to handle more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and expectations. The man's argument is that since he contributes more financially, she should take on more chores. But relationships typically involve shared responsibilities regardless of financial contributions. Even if one person pays more, chores are often split based on what each person can do or what's fair for both.\n\nAlso, the arrangement worked for two years but now she's becoming irritable. Maybe she feels the workload is too much, or she's resentful because the division of chores isn't balanced. The man might not be considering her feelings or the fact that she might be overburdened. It's possible he's assuming that because he pays more, she should do more, but that's not necessarily how relationships work. Emotional labor and other tasks are part of the equation too.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the man isn't pulling his weight in other ways. If he's not doing any chores, even if she's doing all, that could be the issue. Even if he's paying more, he should contribute to the household tasks. The fact that she's irritated suggests the current arrangement isn't working for her. The man might be in the wrong if he's expecting her to handle all the chores without any reciprocal effort from him.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because expecting more chores from his partner based on financial contributions alone isn't fair, and he should be sharing the responsibilities more equitably.\n"
