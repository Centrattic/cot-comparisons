      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where he expects his girlfriend to do cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent/utilities. They've been together for 8 years, live in a house he owns, and their salaries are different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's fair in a relationship. Traditionally, some people might expect the person earning more to handle more financial responsibilities, but household chores aren't necessarily tied to who pays for what. The author is assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But maybe that's an outdated view.\n\nHe mentions it's been working for two years, but she's getting irritable now. That change might indicate that she's feeling overburdened or that their arrangement isn't fair anymore. Even if they had an agreement before, relationships evolve, and needs can change. The author might not be considering her current feelings or the balance of responsibilities beyond just money.\n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and pays more utilities doesn't automatically mean he should assign chores. Housework is a shared responsibility in many relationships, regardless of income. Maybe the author isn't being flexible enough to adjust the chores as their situation changes. She might feel that the chores are unfair given her financial contribution or her own workload.\n\nAnother angle is that expecting someone to do chores just because another person pays more could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy. Relationships often require mutual effort and understanding, not just splitting tasks based on who pays what. The author might be overlooking her emotional labor or other contributions that aren't monetary.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might be to balance things based on financial input, it's possible that he's not considering the emotional and practical aspects of their current situation. The fact that she's irritable suggests the arrangement isn't working for her anymore. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not being willing to reassess the division of labor.\n"
