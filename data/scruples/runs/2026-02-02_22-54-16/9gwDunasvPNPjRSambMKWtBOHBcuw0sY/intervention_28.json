      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, pays more because his salary is double hers. She does the chores, which worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, so shared responsibilities are important. The author pays more because of higher income, but expecting her to do all the cleaning and cooking might be seen as unequal. Even though he pays more, chores aren't just about money. Maybe she feels undervalued or that her contributions aren't recognized.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong. Maybe they think since he pays more, she should handle more chores. But relationships aren't just transactional. Emotional labor and fairness matter. If she's getting irritable, maybe the arrangement isn't fair anymore. The author might not be considering her feelings or changing circumstances. \n\nThe key points are: they've been together a long time, so expectations might have shifted. She's doing all the chores, which could be leading to resentment. The author's reasoning is based on financial contribution, but maybe he's not acknowledging that chores aren't just about money. They should communicate better about what each expects. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her growing irritation and the emotional aspect, maybe he is. But others might say that splitting chores based on financial contribution is fair. It's a bit subjective. But since she's showing signs of stress, maybe the author should adjust. So the answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because the arrangement isn't fair if it's causing her stress. But some might say B (no) because of the financial split. I need to decide based on general relationship advice. Usually, chores should be shared regardless of income. So expecting her to do all because he pays more is probably not fair. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
