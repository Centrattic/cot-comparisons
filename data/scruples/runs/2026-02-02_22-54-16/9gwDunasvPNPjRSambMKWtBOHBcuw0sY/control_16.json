      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They've been together 8 years, live in a house he owns, and he pays more rent/utilities because his salary is twice hers. The arrangement has worked for two years, but she's getting irritable now.\n\nFirst, the assumption here is that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But relationships aren't always about splitting chores based on income. There's a cultural expectation sometimes that whoever pays more should get others to do more labor, but that's not necessarily fair. \n\nHe owns the house, so maybe he expects her to take care of it. However, expecting someone to do all the cleaning and cooking just because you pay more might not consider her contribution. She's living there too, so maybe the chores should be shared regardless of who pays how much. \n\nAlso, their dynamic might have changed. If she's been doing it for two years and now it's causing stress, maybe the balance needs to be re-evaluated. The key point is communication. If he hasn't discussed this with her and is just expecting her to keep up without considering her feelings, that's part of the problem. \n\nHe might be in the wrong because the arrangement wasn't agreed upon mutually, and now her feelings are being ignored. It's important in relationships to have mutual understanding and flexibility. So the answer might lean towards AITA (Author is at Fault). But I need to check if there's a cultural context I'm missing. In some cultures, maybe this is normal, but generally, sharing chores is more common. So probably AITA.\n"
