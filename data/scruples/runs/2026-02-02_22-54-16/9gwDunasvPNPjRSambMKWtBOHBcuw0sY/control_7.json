      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend doing the cooking and cleaning because he pays more rent and utilities. They've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he covers more of the rent/utilities. She's been getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if it's his fault for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what factors determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the arrangement of responsibilities and the recent change in her attitude. The user (he) assumes that because he's paying more, she should do the chores. But maybe there's an imbalance in expectations. Even though he's paying more, housework isn't necessarily something that can be split proportionally to income. Relationships often require equal effort in chores regardless of financial contributions unless both parties agree otherwise.\n\nThe couple has been in a stable arrangement for two years, but now she's getting irritable. This might indicate that her contribution is causing her stress, or perhaps she feels undervalued. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might not absolve him from sharing household duties. Many people believe that housework should be shared equally, or based on mutual agreement, not just financial contributions.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If they haven't discussed this arrangement openly, he might be making assumptions. The girlfriend could feel that even though he pays more, she's overburdened with chores. Alternatively, maybe she's feeling that her contribution isn't being acknowledged, especially if the chores have increased or she's under more stress.\n\nAlso, cultural or personal expectations might play a role. If the couple previously agreed on her doing the chores as a trade for him covering more expenses, then it's a mutual agreement. But if she's now feeling that the arrangement is unfair, perhaps because her workload is too much, he might be in the wrong for not adjusting the responsibilities.\n\nIt's also important to consider that financial contributions don't necessarily translate to equal division of labor. Many relationships aim for a balance where both partners contribute in ways that suit them, but not necessarily proportionally. If he's not doing any chores, even if he's paying more, that might be seen as unfair.\n\nIn summary, the key issue is whether the current division of labor is fair and agreed upon by both. If the girlfriend is now irritable, it's a sign that the arrangement might need to be renegotiated. The author might be in the wrong for assuming that his financial contributions alone justify expecting her to handle all the chores without considering her feelings or workload. So the answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because the arrangement might be causing her stress, and he's not shared the chores equally.\n"
