      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework since they pay more of the rent and utilities. They've been together eight years, live together, and the house is in the author's name. The girlfriend does cooking and cleaning, which the author says has worked well for two years, but recently she's been getting irritable.\n\nFirst, the key factors here are the financial contributions and the division of labor. The author makes twice as much, so they pay more for rent and utilities. The girlfriend's role includes cooking and cleaning. The author's reasoning is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should handle more chores. But the girlfriend is now upset about this arrangement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial thought is maybe not, because they're contributing more financially and that's their rationale. However, relationships often require mutual agreement and communication. Just because someone pays more doesn't automatically mean the other person is obligated to do more chores. The girlfriend's irritability suggests she might feel the division isn't fair or is unbalanced. \n\nAlso, the assumption that more financial contribution equals more chores might be a traditional view of household roles, which some people might find outdated. In modern relationships, many couples aim for a more equal division of labor regardless of who earns more. The author's approach might be based on an unspoken expectation that wasn't discussed, leading to the girlfriend's irritation. \n\nThe problem could be that the author hasn't checked in with the girlfriend to see if the current arrangement is still acceptable. If they haven't had a conversation about the division of chores, it's possible the expectations have changed on her end without being communicated. The author's stance might stem from a place of fairness based on financial input, but the girlfriend might feel that emotional labor or other factors aren't being considered. \n\nMoreover, in a long-term relationship of eight years, it's possible that the dynamics have shifted. The girlfriend might be taking on more than just cooking and cleaning, or maybe she's feeling the workload is unfair now due to other commitments or stress. The author's not addressing her irritability directly and instead justifying their position might be a red flag. \n\nSo, while the author's reasoning is based on contributing more financially, the key issue is whether that translates to the girlfriend's responsibilities. The answer hinges on mutual agreement and communication. If the arrangement was always mutual and discussed, the author might not be wrong. However, if it's an unspoken expectation, then maybe the author is. Since the girlfriend is now irritable, the author should consider if their expectations are too rigid and if there's a need for a new conversation about how to share responsibilities more equitably, perhaps not strictly based on financial contributions but on mutual needs and capacities at this point in their lives.\n"
