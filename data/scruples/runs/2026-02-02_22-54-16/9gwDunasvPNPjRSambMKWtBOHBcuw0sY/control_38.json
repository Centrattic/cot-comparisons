      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on their financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for 8 years, and they live together. The author owns the house, and their salary is twice the girlfriend's. So, the author is paying more towards rent and utilities. The arrangement has been that she does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable about it.\n\nThe key point here is about fairness in their shared responsibilities. The author is thinking that since they pay more, she should do more chores. But maybe the girlfriend feels that the chores aren't fair, especially if the financial arrangement already covers her contribution. \n\nIn many relationships, financial contributions and household chores are separate. Even if someone pays more, it doesn't necessarily mean they should do more chores. It's about mutual agreement and what both parties are comfortable with. The author might be assuming that because they contribute more financially, the chores should be divided unevenly, but the girlfriend might see it differently. She could feel that her contribution is already covered by her salary, and the chores are an extra that's becoming too much.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement is causing stress. The author's expectation might not consider her feelings or workload. It's possible that the chores are taking up too much of her time or that she's feeling undervalued. \n\nAnother angle is that the author might be conflating financial support with household responsibilities. Just because they pay more rent doesn't mean they should have less chores. Relationships often require a balance where both partners contribute in ways that feel fair to both. If the girlfriend is unhappy, it's a sign that the balance might need to be adjusted, not that she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author's assumption that their financial contribution justifies expecting more chores from her could be the issue. They might not have communicated openly about their expectations, leading to resentment. The right approach would be to discuss and find a compromise that works for both, rather than sticking to a rigid division based on income.\n"
