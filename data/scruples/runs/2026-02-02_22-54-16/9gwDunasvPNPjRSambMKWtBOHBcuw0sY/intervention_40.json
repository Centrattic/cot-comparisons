      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given that he pays more of the rent and utilities because his salary is higher. The girlfriend has been doing the chores, but now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They've been together 8 years and live together. The author owns the house, so maybe there's a sense of responsibility tied to that. But he's paying more because his salary is higher. The arrangement has worked for two years. Now she's upset. \n\nThe question is whether expecting her to do more housework is fair. The author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should cover more chores. But chores aren't just about money; they're about shared responsibilities in a relationship. Traditionally, some people think that financial contribution should be matched with domestic duties, but modern views often advocate for equal sharing regardless of income. \n\nThe problem is that the author might be assuming that because he pays more, she should do more. But maybe the girlfriend feels that despite her lower income, she's contributing in other ways, or that the chores are becoming too much. Also, maybe the workload isn't balanced. If she's doing all the cooking and cleaning, even if he's paying more, it could lead to resentment. \n\nThe key here is whether the expectation is fair and communicated. If the author hasn't discussed this with her and she's now upset, he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings or workload. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement on responsibilities. Assuming that financial contribution dictates chores might not account for other factors like time, energy, or personal preferences. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's been irritable lately suggests that the arrangement isn't working for her anymore. Maybe she's taking on too much, or there's an imbalance. The author should consider talking to her about how they can share responsibilities more equitably, rather than sticking to a past arrangement that's now causing stress. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is flawed because domestic responsibilities shouldn't be solely based on financial contributions. It's about mutual effort and respect. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not adapting to her current situation and not discussing the workload together.\n"
