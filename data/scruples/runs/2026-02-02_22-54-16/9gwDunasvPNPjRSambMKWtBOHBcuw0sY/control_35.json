      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who've been together for 8 years and live in a house owned by the author. The author's salary is twice that of his girlfriend's, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. However, recently she's been irritable about the chores, and the author is questioning if he's in the wrong for expecting her to continue doing more housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, and it seems they've had an arrangement where the author contributes financially more and she handles domestic chores. The key point here is whether this arrangement is fair or if the author is making an unfair assumption based on financial contributions.\n\nHousehold responsibilities can be a sensitive topic. Even though the author is paying more, it's important to consider if the current division of labor is balanced. Just because someone pays more doesn't necessarily mean they should handle more chores. Relationships often require mutual effort and communication. If the girlfriend is feeling overburdened, that's a valid concern. The author might be assuming that financial contributions should automatically translate to less domestic work, but emotional labor and physical chores are different. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend is irritable suggests that the current setup isn't working for her. The author might not be considering her feelings or the fact that she might feel her contributions aren't being recognized or appreciated. Even if the arrangement worked for two years, it's possible that her circumstances or feelings have changed. \n\nAnother angle is that the house is solely in the author's name, which might give him a sense of entitlement, but that's not necessarily a valid reason to expect more from his partner. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and understanding rather than ownership. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing her to do the chores; it's part of their arrangement. If she agreed to it and it worked before, maybe the issue is recent stress or other factors affecting her. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting her to continue. \n\nIn many relationships, fairness isn't just about who pays what but also about shared responsibilities. Even if one person contributes more financially, both should share in household duties unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. The author might be taking that agreement for granted and not adapting to her current feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is considering her current needs and if the arrangement is still consensual. If he's not open to discussing a different division of chores, he might be in the wrong. But if the arrangement was agreed upon and he's not being coercive, maybe not. However, since she's expressing irritation, it's a sign that the current setup isn't satisfactory, so the author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n"
