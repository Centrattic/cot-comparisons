      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given their financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for 8 years, so it's a long-term situation. The man owns the house and pays more towards rent and utilities because his salary is double hers. They've had an arrangement where she handles the cooking and cleaning for the last two years. Now, she's getting irritable about the chores, and the author is wondering if he's wrong for expecting her to do more since he covers more of the expenses.\n\nI need to consider the fairness of the division of labor. Financial contributions are significant here. The man is paying more, so maybe he feels entitled to less household work. But chores aren't just about money; they're also about shared responsibility in a relationship. Even if one person contributes more financially, emotional labor and domestic tasks are important. \n\nThe woman's irritability suggests she might feel overburdened. Maybe the division of chores isn't balanced. If the man expects her to do more, he might not be considering her feelings or the fact that money isn't the only contribution. Relationships often require compromise. The man might be in the wrong if he's rigid about the arrangement without communication or flexibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for so long implies that the balance might have shifted over time. What worked two years ago might not work now. He should discuss it with her to understand her perspective instead of just expecting her to continue as before. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting her to take on more chores without considering her feelings or the evolving dynamics isn't fair. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and shared responsibility beyond just financial contributions.\n"
