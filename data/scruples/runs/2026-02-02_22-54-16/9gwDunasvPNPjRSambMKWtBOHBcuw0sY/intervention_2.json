      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects their girlfriend to do cooking and cleaning, and she's getting irritable about it.\n\nFirst, they've been together 8 years and live together. The author owns the house and pays more towards rent and utilities because they earn twice as much as the girlfriend. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. It worked for two years, but now she's upset. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for expecting her to do more since they pay more.\n\nHmm. So, the core issue is the division of household chores and whether it's fair. The author's reasoning is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should take on more chores. But maybe that's not the right approach. Relationships often require mutual agreement and communication. If the arrangement worked for two years but now the girlfriend is unhappy, maybe the author hasn't considered her changing feelings or needs. Expecting someone to do more chores just because you pay more might not account for other factors like time, personal preferences, or stress levels. \n\nAlso, fairness in relationships isn't just about splitting chores based on income. It's about mutual respect and understanding. If the author hasn't discussed this and is just assuming it's fair based on financial contributions, that could be a problem. The girlfriend's irritation might indicate that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore, and the author should address it with empathy rather than sticking to a transactional view. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering her current feelings and the arrangement isn't being re-evaluated. But maybe some would argue B (not wrong) if they see the financial contribution as a valid reason. However, in most modern contexts, relationships require more balanced approaches beyond just financial contributions. So I think the answer is A.\n"
