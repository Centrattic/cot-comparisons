      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on their financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and lives in a house owned by the author. The author earns twice as much as the girlfriend, so they pay more for rent and utilities. In return, the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's irritable about chores.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault for expecting her to handle more housework since they pay more. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the financial contributions and the division of household labor. The author's reasoning is that because they pay more, the girlfriend should do more chores. But is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting tasks based on income. It's more about mutual respect and what both partners are comfortable with. If the arrangement was agreed upon and worked well for two years, a sudden change in the girlfriend's attitude might indicate other issues. Maybe she's feeling overburdened or there's an imbalance she didn't mind before. The author might be assuming that their higher contribution justifies more chores for her, but relationships require communication. The author should probably talk to her instead of making assumptions.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in the author's name and they pay more utilities doesn't necessarily mean the chores should be split that way. Household responsibilities are often about what each person can contribute, regardless of income. If the author's job allows them to cook or clean, maybe they should share more. Expecting someone to do chores solely because they earn less might not be fair, especially if it leads to resentment.\n\nSo, the author's expectation might be based on a flawed premise. They might not be considering the emotional labor or the girlfriend's potential stress. Communication is key here. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing the issue collaboratively instead of sticking to an old agreement that's causing tension.\n"
