      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The setup is that they've been together 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. The author makes twice as much as his girlfriend, so he pays more in rent/utilities. In return, she does cooking and cleaning. But lately, she's been irritable about the chores, and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong for still expecting her to do more housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-term partnership, which often involves shared responsibilities. The fact that they've been together 8 years suggests they've established some routine. However, the author seems to be framing the arrangement as a trade-off based on income. He pays more because he earns more, and she does the chores. That might be the crux here.\n\nBut modern relationships often emphasize equality in household responsibilities regardless of income. The idea that higher income automatically means others should take on more chores could be problematic. Even if they agreed this way initially, maybe she's feeling it's unfair now. The author's assumption that his financial contribution justifies her doing more chores might be the issue here.\n\nAlso, considering that they live together, the chores are part of maintaining their shared home. It's not just about who pays what but about shared responsibility. If she's been getting irritable, perhaps there's a mismatch in expectations. The author might not be considering her feelings or the balance of household work. Even if he pays more, emotional labor and household tasks aren't necessarily proportional to income. \n\nMoreover, the fact that the house is in his name could add another layer. She might feel like she's contributing more in labor while he owns the property, which could lead to resentment. The author might not see the connection between her chores and his ownership, but that's a valid concern for her.\n\nIn many relationships, fairness isn't just about splitting tasks 50/50 but about what each person values and feels is equitable. If the author is expecting her to continue doing more because he pays more, that could be a traditional view that doesn't account for mutual respect and shared partnership. The key point here is whether the author is being considerate of her feelings and if the arrangement is causing her distress. The author might be in the wrong if he's not adjusting to her needs and maintaining the same expectations despite her discomfort.\n"
