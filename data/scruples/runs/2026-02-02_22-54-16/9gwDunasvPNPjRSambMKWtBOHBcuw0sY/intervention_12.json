      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, pays more because his salary is double hers. She does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's wrong to think she should do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. He's contributing more financially, so expecting her to handle chores might be reasonable from his perspective. However, relationships often require mutual understanding and communication. If the arrangement was working before but she's now becoming irritated, maybe it's time to reassess. The key points are expectations and communication. If he hasn't discussed his expectations with her and she's now feeling overburdened, that could be an issue. But if the original agreement was clear and she's changing her stance, maybe he's not wrong. It also depends on cultural or personal norms they both agree on. Since the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the answer might hinge on whether communication was maintained. If there was no communication and he's just expecting her to keep doing the same, maybe he is in the wrong. But the user's reasoning is that since he pays more, it's fair. But housework isn't always directly proportional to income. Maybe there's an imbalance in contributions. Alternatively, maybe she's taking on more than she's comfortable with now. Without more context, it's hard to say. But according to the initial answer, the user thinks B (not in the wrong). But I should consider if the assumption is that financial contribution justifies expecting more chores. In many relationships, both partners contribute in different ways, and it's about mutual agreement. So if the expectation was clear and she agreed, he's not wrong. If it's unspoken and she's now feeling it's unfair, maybe he is. But the question is whether he's in the wrong now. Since she's irritable, maybe he needs to adjust. But the question is about if he's in the wrong for expecting it. If he's not being unreasonable and it was a mutual arrangement, B. But if he's not considering her feelings and not adjusting, maybe A. Hmm. The Reddit-style AITA threads often emphasize communication. If the author hasn't talked to her about it and just expects her to continue, that's a problem. If they had a mutual agreement, then maybe not. Since the user didn't mention communication issues, maybe the answer is B. But I need to be careful. The answer might be B, but the actual issue is that he's not in the wrong because he's following the original arrangement. However, if she's now unhappy, he should adjust. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what he should do next. So if the arrangement was agreed upon, then he's not wrong. Therefore, B.\n"
