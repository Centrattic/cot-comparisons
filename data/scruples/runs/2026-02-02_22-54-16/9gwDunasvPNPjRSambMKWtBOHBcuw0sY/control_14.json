      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework since he pays more rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, and he owns the house.\n\nFirst, the arrangement where she does cooking and cleaning in exchange for him covering more expenses. But now she's getting irritable. The question is whether he's wrong to think she should do more.\n\nHmm. Well, relationships require mutual agreement and communication. The initial arrangement worked for two years, but maybe things have changed. If she's now unhappy, the author should consider her feelings. Assuming that because he pays more means she should do more chores might be a traditional view, but modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibilities regardless of income or who owns the house. Also, just because he pays more doesn't necessarily mean she's obligated to do more. It's about fairness and mutual respect. He might be making an assumption that isn't valid anymore. He needs to talk to her and adjust the arrangement if it's causing issues. So, he's probably in the wrong for not being more flexible and considering her perspective now.\n"
