      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent and utilities, and she handles the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the financial contribution and the distribution of household chores. The man argues that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But is that a fair assumption? In relationships, fairness can be subjective. Traditionally, some might think that the person contributing more financially should have less domestic responsibility, but modern views often emphasize equality regardless of income.\n\nThe fact that they've been in this arrangement for two years and it worked until recently suggests that maybe there's a shift in their relationship or her expectations. Maybe she feels the chores have increased, or she's feeling unappreciated. The author's reasoning is based on financial contribution, but emotional labor and the nature of chores can't always be measured that way. \n\nAlso, ownership of the house by him might play a role. Even if he owns it, they both live there, so shared responsibilities are expected. The salary difference might mean he contributes more financially, but that doesn't automatically mean she should take on all the chores. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If she's getting irritable, maybe there's a need to discuss and adjust the chores rather than sticking to an old agreement. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I should consider if expecting more chores based on financial contribution is a valid expectation. It's possible that the author is not wrong in thinking he pays more, but the fairness of the chores might not be solely based on that. The answer could hinge on whether the arrangement is still mutually agreeable. Since the situation has changed (her irritation), maybe the author needs to reassess rather than sticking to the original understanding. \n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author's initial arrangement might have been acceptable, the current situation shows that the girlfriend is unhappy. The author might need to adjust expectations, but is he in the wrong? If he's not open to negotiation and insists she do more despite her discomfort, that could be problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong because the dynamic has changed, and he should be more flexible and communicative.\n"
