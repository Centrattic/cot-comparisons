      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years, live in a house owned by the author, and he pays more because his salary is double hers. They've had a system where she does the chores, but now she's irritable. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. The author owns the house, so he's responsible for the mortgage or rent, which is a big expense. His higher income allows him to cover more of the utilities and rent. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This seems like a mutual agreement they've had for two years. But now she's upset.\n\nThe question is whether this arrangement is fair. The author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should take on more chores. But in relationships, fairness can be subjective. Some might argue that splitting chores should be based on what each person can do, not just financial contributions. However, others might see it as a fair exchange where each contributes in their area\u2014financial vs. domestic.\n\nHowever, the fact that the house is in his name and he pays more might lead others to believe that he's already contributing more in a significant way, so expecting her to do the chores is reasonable. But if the chores are becoming a point of contention, maybe the arrangement needs to be reevaluated. The author might not be in the wrong initially, but the current situation is causing tension. The key here is whether the author's expectation is unreasonable given the circumstances. Since the user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is causing issues, perhaps the answer is B. But I need to check if there's any implicit assumption that chores should be split equally regardless of financial contributions, which might not be the case. Also, the length of the relationship (8 years) suggests that the initial agreement might have changed over time. But the user's answer is B, so I need to see if that's valid.\n"
