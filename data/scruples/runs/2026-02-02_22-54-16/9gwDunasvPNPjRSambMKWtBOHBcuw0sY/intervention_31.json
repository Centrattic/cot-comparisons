      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, and his salary is about double hers, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement has been working for two years, but recently she's been getting irritable about her chores. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about the division of household chores. The author believes that because he contributes more financially (paying more rent/utilities), his girlfriend should take on more chores. But the girlfriend is now getting upset about this arrangement. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, expectations in relationships, and what constitutes fairness. In many relationships, there's an expectation that responsibilities are shared, but how that's balanced can vary. Some people might argue that financial contributions should be considered when dividing chores, while others might think chores should be shared equally regardless of income or who owns the house.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he pays more, his girlfriend should handle more chores. However, expecting someone to do chores as a trade-off for paying a larger share might not be fair if the chores are seen as part of shared household responsibilities. Also, the girlfriend's increasing irritability suggests that the arrangement is causing tension. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the arrangement was agreed upon and working for two years but is now causing friction, maybe the author hasn't considered her current situation or feelings. Perhaps she's taking on more than she can handle now, or maybe there's a shift in their dynamic that needs to be addressed through discussion rather than assumption.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author owns the house might influence perceptions. Some people might see ownership as a reason to contribute more financially, but it's not necessarily a justification for expecting more chores from the other partner. It's possible that the girlfriend feels her chores are a form of contribution, but if she's feeling overburdened, the author isn't addressing her needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, household responsibilities often depend on mutual agreement and what feels equitable to both partners. If one partner feels they are doing more than their fair share, even if it was an initial agreement, that can lead to resentment. The key here is whether the current arrangement is still mutually acceptable. Since the girlfriend is now irritable, it indicates that the arrangement isn't working as well as before.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her feelings and the change in her situation. Instead of expecting her to continue as before, he should communicate and possibly renegotiate the division of chores. Assuming that financial contributions directly translate to chores might be oversimplifying the relationship's dynamics. Relationships require flexibility and empathy, and if the girlfriend is unhappy, it's important to address that rather than stick rigidly to an old agreement.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's expectation might be contributing to the problem. He might not be in the wrong in terms of his initial reasoning, but the fact that he's not addressing her current feelings could make him the asshole. The answer would depend on whether he's open to adjusting their arrangement now that there's tension.\n"
