      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThey've been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in his name, and he makes twice what she does. He pays more rent/utilities, so she does the cooking and cleaning. That's worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework because he pays more.\n\nFirst, I should think about fairness in relationships. Housework is often a topic of discussion in couples, especially when there's a financial imbalance. The key here is whether the arrangement is fair and agreed upon. If they had an understanding where she does more chores because he pays more, that might be okay. But if she's feeling overburdened or it's causing stress, maybe the arrangement is no longer sustainable.\n\nThe problem is that he's thinking she needs to do more because he pays more, but she's getting irritable. That suggests a conflict. Maybe she feels the workload is too much, or perhaps she feels it's unfair. The question is whether he's wrong to expect her to do more based on financial contributions.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting chores isn't always a direct exchange for money. Some people might argue that chores are shared responsibilities regardless of who pays the bills. Others might think that if one person contributes more financially, they should take on more chores. However, if the arrangement was working before but now isn't, it's possible that the expectations have shifted or her capacity to handle the chores has decreased.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If they haven't discussed the chores and their expectations, maybe the issue is a lack of communication rather than who's in the wrong. Also, the fact that she's getting irritable might mean she's feeling stressed or overworked, which is a sign that the current arrangement might not be fair anymore.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms, but it's better to focus on mutual agreement and respect. If he's assuming she must do more because he pays more, and she's not okay with that, then he might be in the wrong by not acknowledging her feelings and not adjusting the chores to a more balanced system.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he owns the house and pays more might lead him to feel entitled to more from her, but that's a red flag. Ownership of the house doesn't necessarily translate to a higher share of chores. It's about mutual respect and what both partners agree on.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be in the wrong because he's expecting his girlfriend to do more chores based on his financial contributions without considering her feelings or the current state of their relationship. The arrangement that worked before might not be suitable now, and he should be open to adjusting the chores rather than expecting her to continue as before.\n"
