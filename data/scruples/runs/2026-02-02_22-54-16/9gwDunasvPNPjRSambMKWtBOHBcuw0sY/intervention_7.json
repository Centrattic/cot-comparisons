      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do cooking and cleaning. The setup is that they've been together for 8 years and live together. The author owns the house and pays more because their salary is twice the girlfriend's. The girlfriend was doing the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years, but now she's irritable about the chores. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for thinking she should do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying more towards rent and utilities because their income is higher. That probably means the total expenses are split unevenly. So, in some ways, the author is contributing more financially. However, housework isn't a direct monetary contribution. The idea that someone should do more chores because they earn more could be seen as a way to balance contributions, but it might not be fair or considerate of the girlfriend's needs and feelings.\n\nNow, the problem arises because the girlfriend is getting irritable. That suggests that the current arrangement is causing her stress or dissatisfaction. The author's reasoning is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should take on more chores. But maybe the issue is that the girlfriend feels overburdened, especially if she's working and managing the household tasks. Even if the author is paying more financially, emotional labor and physical chores can be significant and might not be balanced in a way that's fair or sustainable.\n\nAnother angle is the duration. The arrangement worked for two years, but now it's causing issues. Maybe the girlfriend's circumstances have changed\u2014perhaps her job is more demanding, she's dealing with personal stress, or she's feeling taken advantage of. The author's expectation might not account for these changes. It's possible that the author isn't considering the girlfriend's perspective and is instead sticking to a transactional view of household duties based on income.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things equally. It's about mutual respect and understanding each partner's contributions and needs. If the author is only focusing on their financial contribution and not the emotional or physical labor, they might be overlooking the girlfriend's well-being. The key here is communication. The author might need to talk to the girlfriend to understand why she's irritable and find a solution that works for both of them, rather than holding onto the previous arrangement without considering her current situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is solely in the author's name might add some pressure, but that's more about ownership and less about day-to-day responsibilities. However, it could affect how responsibilities are perceived. The author might feel entitled to have the girlfriend handle certain tasks because they're covering more of the costs, but that could be seen as using financial contributions to justify unequal labor.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be to balance contributions, the girlfriend's irritable reaction indicates that the current setup isn't working for her. The author might be in the wrong if they're not willing to adjust and communicate, assuming that the initial arrangement should stay the same despite her distress. The problem is likely more about the lack of adaptability and empathy rather than the initial expectation itself.\n"
