      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been with their girlfriend for 8 years and live together. The house is in the author's name, and their salary is twice as much as hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But she's been getting irritable about some chores, and the author is wondering if he's wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for a long time, which suggests they've had a lot of time to adjust to each other's habits and expectations. The author owns the house and pays a larger share of the expenses, so he might feel like he's contributing more financially and thus expects her to handle more chores. But does that mean she's obligated to do so?\n\nIn many relationships, the distribution of chores isn't always strictly tied to financial contributions. It often depends on mutual agreement and what both partners are comfortable with. The fact that it worked for two years but now she's become irritated might indicate that her capacity or willingness to handle those tasks has changed. Maybe she's feeling overburdened, or perhaps there's a different expectation now.\n\nThe key point here is that the author is assuming she should do more because he pays more. However, fairness in a relationship isn't necessarily about splitting tasks based on income. It's more about mutual respect and understanding each other's strengths, preferences, and time availability. If the arrangement was working before, maybe the author hasn't adapted to any new circumstances. For example, maybe she's taking on more tasks outside the home now, like work or other responsibilities, leading to her irritability.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might not directly relate to the chores, unless they have a specific agreement. But usually, household responsibilities are about the time and effort each person is willing to contribute, not just who the property is under. The author might be overlooking the emotional labor or the time she spends on chores versus his financial contributions.\n\nAnother angle is that expecting someone to do chores because you pay more could be seen as transactional. Relationships often thrive on shared responsibilities and teamwork rather than a strict trade-off. If the author is treating the chores as a debt she owes for his financial support, that's not healthy. It's possible that she's feeling taken advantage of, especially if the chores have increased or if she's not happy with the arrangement anymore.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and the fact that she's already taking on the cooking and cleaning. Maybe the workload is too much for her, or she wants a more balanced approach. The irritability suggests she's not happy with the current setup, and instead of expecting her to do more, he should communicate and find a solution that works for both. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
