      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning, given their financial arrangement.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and lives together. The author owns the house, pays more due to a higher salary (twice his girlfriend's). They've had a setup where she does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Now, she's getting irritable about the chores. The author is wondering if he's at fault for expecting her to continue.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics and fairness. The author argues that since he pays more, she compensates with chores. But in relationships, chores often depend on mutual agreement and what both parties are comfortable with. Even if there's a financial contribution difference, expectations around chores can vary. \n\nThe fact that she's become irritable suggests that the current arrangement might be causing her stress. The author's assumption that she must do more because of his financial contribution could be problematic. Relationships should involve open communication. Maybe the author hasn't discussed her feelings or the workload. If the chores are causing her distress, the author might need to adjust, even if it's not strictly \"wrong\" in a transactional sense.\n\nAlso, considering that their arrangement worked for two years, maybe there's a shift in their circumstances or her feelings. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible if he's not willing to reassess the balance. Fairness isn't just about financial contributions but emotional labor and mutual satisfaction.\n\nIn many relationships, an equitable split isn't always equal in a monetary sense but considers each person's capacity and comfort. The author might be overlooking her emotional state, which is important. So while he's not necessarily in the wrong for expecting her to contribute, he might need to be more flexible and communicative. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), it's because there's no inherent wrongness in expecting reciprocal chores. But if A (Yes), it's because not considering her feelings and adjusting accordingly is where he's at fault.\n\nI think the key here is the author's failure to adapt to her changing feelings. Even if the initial arrangement made sense, not addressing her irritation could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes), as he's not considering her current well-being and the need for a balanced approach beyond just financial contributions.\n"
