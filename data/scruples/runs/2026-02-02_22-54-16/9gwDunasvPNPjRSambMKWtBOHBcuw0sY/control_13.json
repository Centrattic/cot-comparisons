      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting his girlfriend to do more housework, given that he pays more of the rent/utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he covers more of the expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the assumption that paying more should mean the other person does more chores. Is that a fair expectation? Relationships often require mutual agreement on responsibilities. The fact that it's worked for two years suggests it was an unspoken agreement. But now she's getting irritable. Maybe she feels overburdened or there's a change in her circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether expecting someone to do chores based on financial contribution is valid. Some might argue that chores aren't directly tied to income, and emotional labor or time should be considered. Others might see it as fair since he's contributing more monetarily. However, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning could be seen as traditional gender roles, which some people find outdated.\n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house complicates things. If he owns it, maybe she's contributing in other ways. But he still pays more utilities. The problem is that the arrangement that worked before isn't working now. The author's expectation might not account for her changing needs or stress levels.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication and renegotiation are key. If he's expecting her to do more because of financial reasons without checking in on her feelings, he might be in the wrong. It's possible he's not considering her perspective and the emotional aspect. The answer might hinge on whether the expectation is fair or if it's a one-sided arrangement based on traditional roles.\n"
