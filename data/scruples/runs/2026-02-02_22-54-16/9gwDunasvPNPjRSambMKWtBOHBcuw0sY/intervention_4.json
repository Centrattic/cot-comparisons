      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, he owns the house, pays more in rent/utilities because his salary is double hers, and she does the chores as compensation. Now she's getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so maybe their arrangement was acceptable before but is causing issues now. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might be a point. He's using the salary difference as a reason for her to do more chores. But does that make it fair?\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting tasks based on income. Emotional labor, personal preferences, and energy levels also play a role. If she's feeling overburdened, even if she's doing chores, it might be because the balance isn't right for her. The author assumes that since he pays more, she should contribute more in chores. But maybe she's contributing in other ways or feels the chores are taking a toll on her mentally or physically.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been getting irritable suggests there's some level of resentment building. The author might not be considering her current stress levels or how the chores affect her. Maybe the chores are more than just cooking and cleaning now, or perhaps she's taking on other responsibilities that aren't being acknowledged.\n\nAnother angle: relationships often require compromise. If the original agreement was based on a certain income ratio, but circumstances have changed (maybe her job has become more demanding, or her salary hasn't increased), that could affect her ability or willingness to do the chores. The author's expectation might not account for her current situation.\n\nAlso, the ownership of the house is in his name. Does that mean he's also handling maintenance, property taxes, etc.? If so, that's another form of contribution. But if the chores are seen as something she should do regardless, that might not be fair. It's important to consider mutual respect and communication. If she's expressing irritation, maybe the author should address it by discussing what's causing her stress and finding a new balance rather than sticking to the old arrangement.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a shift towards more equal distribution of household chores regardless of income. However, each relationship is different. The key here is whether the arrangement is causing harm. If she's unhappy and the author isn't addressing her feelings, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is acknowledging her feelings and being open to adjusting the chores. If he's insisting she must do more because of his higher income without considering her current capacity, that could be where he's in the wrong. But if they're both comfortable with the arrangement, maybe not. However, since she's now irritable, it's a sign that the arrangement isn't working for her anymore, so the author should reconsider. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not adapting the arrangement based on her current feelings.\n"
