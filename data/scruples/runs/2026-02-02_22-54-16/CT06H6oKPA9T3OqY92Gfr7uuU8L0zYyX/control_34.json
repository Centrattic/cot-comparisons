I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The key points here are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, the author has brought it up multiple times, there were even arguments about it, and they paid $1000 each for the trip. Now, the author is considering not helping him and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get his passport in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend has had a long time to renew his passport and failed to act. The author has reminded him repeatedly, which shows she was proactive. However, the main issue is whether not helping him further is her responsibility. Since he's an adult, he's ultimately responsible for his own documents. But maybe there's an expectation in the relationship that they should support each other in such matters. \n\nThe cost of the trip is $1000 each, so if they both paid, she's already invested a lot. Letting him miss the trip could result in a financial loss. But was there a shared responsibility to ensure both have valid passports? The author might feel she did her part by reminding him, but he didn't follow through. \n\nEmotionally, the author mentions feeling like a mother to him, which might indicate a dynamic where she takes more responsibility. If she's been nagging him and he's been resistant, maybe she's justified in pulling back. On the other hand, relationships often require compromise and support. Should she have set clearer boundaries earlier? Or is it acceptable to step back now that he hasn't taken action despite her warnings?\n\nLegally, she's not at fault for his expired passport. But morally, if they are a team, maybe she should have ensured he renewed it, but that's a stretch. Since he had multiple chances and didn't act, she might be within her rights to go alone. However, some might argue that abandoning a trip you've planned together could be seen as selfish, especially if the financial loss is significant. But given the context of his repeated failures and her efforts, her actions could be seen as a consequence he brought upon himself.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether the boyfriend's responsibility lies solely with him. If he's an adult, then yes, he's responsible. The author's reminders were sufficient, so she's not in the wrong for not bailing him out now. So the answer is B.\n"
