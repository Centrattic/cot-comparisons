I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, so that's a long time. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They even paid $1000 each for the trip in November. Now the deadline is approaching to renew his passport to get it back in time.\n\nThe author's plan is to not mention it anymore and let him deal with the consequences. They want to go on the trip alone. The question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author has tried to get him to renew the passport and he hasn't acted. They've even had fights. So there's a pattern of negligence on his part. The author is frustrated, maybe feeling like they have to take charge. But is it fair to completely abandon the trip? \n\nFinancially, they both paid, so if he can't go, the author loses their money. But maybe they think he should be responsible for his own documents. However, in a relationship, there's some level of mutual responsibility. But the boyfriend has ignored it despite repeated reminders. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? They've tried to communicate and he didn't act. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions led to the problem. The author is holding him accountable. Though cutting off communication now might be harsh, but the author's intention is to let him face the consequences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have been more proactive in helping him renew it. But the boyfriend didn't take action even when pushed. \n\nThe key points are: boyfriend's fault for not renewing, author tried multiple times, financial loss is mutual. The author's decision to let him face the consequences could be seen as justified. So answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
