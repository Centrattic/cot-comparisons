I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times, even leading to arguments. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him handle the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time, which would mean she goes on the trip alone.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend had the responsibility to renew his passport, but the author kept reminding him. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the boyfriend not taking action despite being reminded. She's at a point where she feels she's done her part and is now choosing not to intervene further. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibility is important, but there's a limit to how much one person should take on. If someone repeatedly ignores a partner's warnings about a critical issue (like a passport), the partner might feel justified in stepping back. However, some might argue that the girlfriend should have taken more proactive steps, like reminding him again closer to the deadline or maybe even helping to renew it, but the scenario states she's not going to say anything now.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The trip cost $1000 each, which is a significant investment. The author might feel it's unfair to lose the trip if the boyfriend is at fault. But if the boyfriend is responsible for his own travel documents, she might not be at fault for not bailing him out at the last minute.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that in a relationship, partners support each other and the girlfriend should have made sure he took action, maybe even helping him directly. However, the question here is about whether she's in the wrong for not intervening now. Since she's already given multiple reminders and even had arguments, it's clear she's tried to communicate. If he still didn't act, maybe she's not in the wrong for walking away.\n\nAlso, the mother-child dynamic mentioned might indicate that she's taken on a caretaker role, but now she's setting a boundary. Setting boundaries is healthy, so letting him face the consequences could be seen as fair.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has done her part in communicating and reminding him, and the final responsibility lies with the boyfriend. She's choosing to hold him accountable for his actions, which isn't being in the wrong.\n"
