I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The couple has been together over a year, and the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has brought up the issue multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid a lot of money for the trip, $1000 each. The deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that she's tired of him not taking responsibility, and she's frustrated with the dynamic where she feels like the parent. She wants to show him the consequences of his inaction. The key points here are responsibility, communication, and whether she's being fair.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author has tried to get him to renew it but he didn't act. She's not forcing him to go on the trip; she's just not helping him anymore. That could be seen as letting him face the natural consequences of his actions, which some might see as fair. \n\nBut on the other hand, they're a couple, and she's aware of the consequences. By not doing anything, she's allowing their relationship to suffer because of his neglect. Some might argue that even if he's at fault, she's still part of the relationship and should have intervened more, maybe set a stricter deadline or taken more direct action. However, she did bring it up multiple times, so maybe she's done her part. \n\nThere's also the financial aspect. They both paid for the trip, so if he can't go, she might lose the money. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about financial loss. \n\nThe author's intention is to let him deal with it, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. Instead of working together to solve the problem, she's withdrawing. But since he's the one who didn't take action despite her warnings, maybe she's not the one in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. The author has tried to communicate, and if he didn't act, then she's not necessarily at fault for not forcing the issue. However, relationships require mutual effort, and maybe she should have been more proactive in helping him get it done, like setting a specific time to do it together. But given the information, she's not the one who caused the passport to expire. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
