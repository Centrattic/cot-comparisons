I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the person has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now that the trip is booked, the author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, responsibility. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own travel documents. The author has tried to bring it up, but maybe not enough? Did they give him enough time to renew it? The trip was booked in November, and the deadline is approaching. If the author gave him ample time to handle it, they might not be at fault. But if they didn't follow up enough, maybe they are partially responsible.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author says they mentioned it several times and had tiffs. That shows they tried. But did they set a specific deadline or check in more closely? If they did, maybe the boyfriend is at fault for not acting. If not, maybe the author could have pushed harder.\n\nIntentions matter too. The author's plan is to let him face the consequences. It's a form of punishment, maybe, due to the boyfriend's negligence. But is that fair? The author might feel frustrated with the boyfriend's immaturity. However, letting someone miss a trip because of their own mistake could be seen as harsh. Also, the trip was paid for, so there's financial loss involved. The author might be angry about that, but it's their partner's responsibility.\n\nThe dynamic they mentioned\u2014feeling like a mother and child\u2014might indicate that the author has taken on a caretaker role. If they've been nagging him repeatedly and he still didn't act, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author didn't make it a priority to ensure he renewed it, perhaps they're sharing some responsibility.\n\nIn the end, since the boyfriend is the one whose passport is expired and the author has tried to address it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key point is whether they gave him enough time and reminders. If they did, then the boyfriend is at fault. If not, maybe the author could have done more. But based on the information given, the author took action by mentioning it multiple times and even booking the trip, so it's more on the boyfriend. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
