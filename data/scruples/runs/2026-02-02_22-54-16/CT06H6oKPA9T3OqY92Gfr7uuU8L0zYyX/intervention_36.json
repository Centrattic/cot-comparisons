I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018. The author has brought up the issue multiple times and even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, which cost $1000 each. The deadline for the boyfriend to renew his passport is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him out, letting him deal with the consequences. The author wants to go on the trip alone if he doesn't get his act together.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend is being irresponsible and juvenile, and the author feels like a parent sometimes. They've tried to address the problem before, but he hasn't taken action. Now, they're considering letting him face the consequences, even if it means he can't join the trip.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFactors to consider: \n- The boyfriend's responsibility to renew his own passport. It's his responsibility, not the author's. If he's been neglecting it, maybe the author isn't wrong to not take over now.\n- However, relationships often involve compromise and support. If the author has tried to help and communicate, maybe it's time to let him take responsibility. On the other hand, maybe the author should have pushed harder or supported more.\n- The financial aspect: both paid for the trip. If they cancel, maybe the author would lose money, but if they go alone, the boyfriend loses his part. But the author isn't causing the problem; it's his own fault. So the author might not be at fault.\n- The emotional dynamic: the author feels like a parent. If the boyfriend is being childish, maybe the author is justified in not bailing him out.\n- However, in a relationship, sometimes you help each other through issues. But if the boyfriend kept ignoring the problem despite warnings, maybe it's his fault.\n\nSo, from my perspective, the author has tried to bring it up multiple times, even had arguments. The boyfriend's fault is more on the line here. The author isn't making him miss the trip; he's missing it because of his own inaction. The author isn't in the wrong for not helping further. So answer B.\n"
