      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the dilemma is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple booked an international trip for March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned the passport renewal several times, even had arguments about it. The deadline to get the passport renewed in time is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend handle it, which would mean he might miss the trip. The cost was $1000 each, so there's financial investment too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping or reminding him again. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author has tried multiple times to get the boyfriend to renew his passport. They had tiffs about it. The boyfriend is described as juvenile and the author feels like a mother in the dynamic. The author is planning to not intervene anymore, even if it means the boyfriend can't go on the trip. \n\nNow, considering responsibility. The boyfriend is an adult. Renewing a passport is the individual's responsibility. The author has done their part by bringing it up. But maybe the author could have taken more proactive steps, like helping him with the process or setting up reminders. However, the author might feel that it's not their responsibility to manage it for him. \n\nOn the other hand, since they're a couple and planning a trip together, maybe there's an expectation of teamwork. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, hence the dynamic issue. But letting the boyfriend face the consequences could also be seen as fair, especially if he's aware of the deadlines and failed to act.\n\nFinancial aspect: Both paid $1000 each. The author is not refunding the money for the boyfriend, but they're just not accompanying him. The boyfriend would lose his own money, which is a consequence he might have to deal with.\n\nEmotional aspect: The author is frustrated with the boyfriend's immaturity. By not helping, they're letting him face the natural consequences of his inaction. But if the author had mentioned it again, maybe the boyfriend would have taken action. However, the author might feel they've done enough.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they've given enough reminders, and the boyfriend failed to act despite knowing the importance, the author isn't necessarily wrong to not step in. However, maybe there's an expectation in a relationship to support each other in planning trips. But the author might feel they've crossed that line by not doing more. \n\nAnother angle: The author could have set up a system to track the renewal process, like setting reminders or helping the boyfriend submit the application. But since the author chose to let it happen, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author has already tried multiple times to address it, and if he didn't act, the author isn't obligated to take further action. Letting him face the consequences isn't necessarily being an asshole, especially if the author feels it's a lesson in responsibility.\n"
