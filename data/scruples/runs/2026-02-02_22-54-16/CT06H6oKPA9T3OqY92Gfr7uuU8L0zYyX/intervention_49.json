I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The scenario is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up several times. They even had arguments about it. Now, with the trip booked and paid for, the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions the boyfriend is juvenile and that they sometimes feel like a parent. That might indicate an imbalance in responsibility. The author has tried multiple times to get the passport renewed, which shows they've made an effort. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping anymore.\n\nThe author's plan is to let the boyfriend handle it on his own. Is this fair? Well, the trip is a shared expense, so if the boyfriend's actions cause him to miss the trip, he might lose his money. But the author is willing to go alone. That could be seen as holding the boyfriend accountable for his own responsibilities. On the other hand, some might argue that relationships require mutual support, so the author should have pushed harder or helped more.\n\nBut the author has already tried to bring it up multiple times and had conflicts. Continuing to pressure might not be effective if the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility. The author is setting a boundary here, which could be healthy if the boyfriend needs to learn responsibility. However, there's also the financial aspect. If the author is using this as leverage, that might be problematic. But the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping now.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the boyfriend didn't take responsibility for his documents, he's the one who caused the problem. The author has done their part by reminding and even arguing. Letting the consequences happen could be a lesson. But relationships often require compromise, and maybe the author could have found a way to help him get it done, like going with him to renew it. However, the author didn't do that, which might be a point against them.\n\nBut ultimately, the author is choosing to let the boyfriend face the natural consequences of his inaction. If the boyfriend didn't act on the reminders, then the author isn't at fault. The answer would depend on whether the author had a duty to intervene more. Since the author tried multiple times and the boyfriend failed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
