I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018. The author has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. The deadline for passport renewal is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences, which would mean he can't go on the trip, and she'd go alone.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners have responsibilities. If one is consistently neglecting a crucial task (like getting a passport renewed) despite being reminded multiple times, the other might feel justified in holding them accountable. But does that mean the author is wrong for not helping or stepping in?\n\nOn one hand, she's made her concerns known. She's given him chances to fix it. If he's been juvenile and not taking responsibility, maybe she's right to let him face the consequences. On the other hand, maybe she should have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport or at least not being passive. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe user is asking for a judgment call. If the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not helping beyond a certain point. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so maybe she should have intervened more. But given that she's already given him multiple chances and he hasn't acted, it's possible she's not at fault. \n\nThe answer hinges on responsibility and accountability. Since the boyfriend's actions (or inactions) led to the problem, and the author has done her part by reminding him, she might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
