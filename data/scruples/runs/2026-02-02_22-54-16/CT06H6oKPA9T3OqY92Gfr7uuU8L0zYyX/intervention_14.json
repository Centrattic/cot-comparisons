I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, which costs $1000 each. Now the passport renewal deadline is approaching, and the author is planning to not help him and let him face the consequences, thus going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. He's been neglecting it for a long time. The author has tried to remind him several times, even had conflicts. So maybe the problem is on his end. The author isn't forcing him to go; he's the one who chose not to renew. If he didn't act on the reminders, then it's his own fault. The author is now deciding not to intervene further. \n\nBut maybe the author should have been more proactive? Like, maybe they could have set a deadline together or checked the status more closely. But the user says they've brought it up several times. Also, the trip was booked in November, which gives time to handle it. If the boyfriend still hasn't taken action, maybe it's too late to blame the author. \n\nThe author is concerned about the dynamic being mother-child, which might imply that she's trying to give him responsibility. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as teaching him a lesson. However, the financial loss is on both of them. She's choosing to go alone, which might be seen as selfish, but she's not at fault if he's the one who didn't act. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have helped him more, like helping him submit the passport renewal. But she might feel that she's already done her part by reminding him. There's a balance between responsibility and support in a relationship. If she's not the one who's in charge of his passport, then it's his responsibility. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because the issue stems from the boyfriend's negligence, and she's holding him accountable for his actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
