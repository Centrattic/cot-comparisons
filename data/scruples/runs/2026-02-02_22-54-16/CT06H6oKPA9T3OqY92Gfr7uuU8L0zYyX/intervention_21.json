I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip. The author's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport despite multiple reminders, and the author is considering not helping him anymore to make him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, so there's been a long time for him to take action. The author has tried to bring it up several times, even had arguments about it. The trip was booked in November, which probably gave them enough time to handle the passport renewal. The deadline is approaching, and the author is thinking of letting him handle it himself now.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a responsibility to ensure the passport was renewed? How much effort has the author already put in? The boyfriend's inaction despite being reminded. The financial aspect\u2014both paid a lot, so the author might be thinking about not wasting money if he doesn't come. \n\nThe author's intention is to let the boyfriend face the consequences because he didn't act, even though the author had tried to help. In relationships, shared responsibilities are common, especially for travel. But if the boyfriend kept ignoring the issue, maybe the author isn't at fault for not continuing to push. The author might be trying to set boundaries here, especially if the boyfriend is juvenile and the author feels like a mother figure. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not helping further? If the author has done their part (reminded, argued), and the boyfriend didn't take action, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that since they're a couple, the author should have kept helping until the last minute. But the author is choosing to let him take responsibility now. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer leans towards B (No), because the boyfriend didn't follow through despite the author's efforts. The author isn't obligated to take full responsibility for his actions indefinitely.\n"
