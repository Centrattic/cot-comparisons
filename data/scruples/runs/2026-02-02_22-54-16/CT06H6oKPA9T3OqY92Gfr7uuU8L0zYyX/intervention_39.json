I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author and their boyfriend are planning a trip in March, but his passport expired in 2018. The author has brought this up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. Now, the deadline is approaching for renewing the passport, and the author is considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it done, maybe even going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should communicate important travel details, especially something critical like a passport. The author has clearly tried to address the problem several times. If the boyfriend ignored these warnings, maybe he's at fault for not taking it seriously. The author's intention to not intervene further could be seen as holding him accountable for his actions. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to punish someone for something you've repeatedly warned them about? The author might be trying to teach him a lesson, but if the trip is already booked and paid for, letting him miss out could be a harsh consequence. Also, maybe the author's role is to support each other in relationships. However, if the boyfriend has been resistant to help, the author might feel like they've done their part. \n\nAnother angle: the financial aspect. Both paid $1000 each. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his money and the trip, which the author might see as a consequence of his inaction. But is it right to let someone suffer financially because they didn't act? Or is it fair since the author already tried to make him aware?\n\nAlso, the dynamic where the author feels like a parent. Maybe this situation is another example of the boyfriend's immaturity. If the author has to constantly remind and nag, it's understandable they might be frustrated and decide to take a hard stance. \n\nHowever, relationships require teamwork. If the author is the one who's proactive and the boyfriend is passive, maybe the author is overstepping by not helping. But the author has already tried to address it, and if the boyfriend isn't taking it seriously, maybe the author is justified in letting him face the consequences. \n\nI think the key points are: repeated warnings, the boyfriend's inaction despite knowing the stakes, and the author's decision to not enable further. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that in a relationship, you should support each other through forgetfulness or mistakes. But this is a case of willful neglect, not a simple oversight. So the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
