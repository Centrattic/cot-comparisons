I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. They even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and now she's considering not saying anything and going on her own if he doesn't get his passport sorted in time.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his own passport. The author kept bringing it up, even had tiffs. But ultimately, the passport is his to manage. She's not the one who holds his passport, right? So if he didn't act on her reminders, is she responsible? Or is this his own fault?\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I can see that. If someone is repeatedly told about something important and doesn't take action, maybe the onus is on them. But maybe there's a point where the partner should have helped more? Like, did she have a duty to check in or help with the renewal process? But it's his passport, so maybe it's his responsibility. \n\nAlso, financial aspect: they both paid for the trip. If he misses it, he might lose the money. But she's not the one who caused the passport issue. So letting him deal with the consequences could be seen as fair. On the other hand, maybe she should have intervened more, like helping him renew it, but she might not have wanted to take that responsibility, especially if he's being juvenile. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not the one who let the passport expire, even though she tried to remind him, then maybe she's not at fault. But some might argue that being in a relationship means being each other's support system, so she should have taken more initiative. However, there's a line where personal responsibility comes into play. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is held responsible if they failed to take necessary steps. Here, the author did her part by bringing it up multiple times. If he didn't act, then she's not to blame. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
