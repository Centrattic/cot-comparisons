I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They had conflicts over it, paid $1000 each for the trip, and now the author is planning to not say anything and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners usually share responsibilities, especially for joint plans like a trip. However, the author has tried to bring it up several times. The boyfriend might have ignored or dismissed the issue, maybe due to being juvenile as the author mentions. The author might feel frustrated after repeated attempts to get the passport renewed.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is at fault for not reminding him again or for not taking more active steps. If the author has already communicated the issue multiple times and the boyfriend hasn't acted, maybe it's on him. But if the author didn't make it clear enough or didn't follow up, perhaps there's some responsibility on the author.\n\nHowever, the author is considering letting the boyfriend face the consequences. Since the deadline is approaching, maybe the author should have reminded him again. But if the boyfriend kept procrastinating despite previous reminders, the author might not be at fault for not doing more. The author might be trying to set boundaries here, especially if they feel the boyfriend is not taking things seriously.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they both paid for the trip. If the boyfriend loses his spot, he might lose his money, but the author would still get to go. Is it fair? The author might see it as a lesson for the boyfriend to be responsible. But some might argue that the author should have held him accountable earlier, not just let it happen at the last minute.\n\nAnother angle: In a relationship, partners often help each other with important tasks. Maybe the author should have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport together. But if the author tried and the boyfriend refused, then the author isn't entirely to blame.\n\nI think the main question is about shared responsibility. If both parties are supposed to contribute to planning a trip, and the author did their part by reminding multiple times, then the fault lies more on the boyfriend. The author's decision to not intervene further might be a form of letting him take responsibility for his actions. However, some might argue that as a partner, the author should have ensured both passports were valid, regardless of the boyfriend's behavior.\n\nBut considering the author's reasoning\u2014they mentioned the boyfriend's juvenile behavior and the dynamic where they feel like a parent\u2014maybe the author is trying to set boundaries. Letting him face the consequences could be a way to encourage responsibility. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a tough situation, but if the author has done their part and the boyfriend failed to act, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
