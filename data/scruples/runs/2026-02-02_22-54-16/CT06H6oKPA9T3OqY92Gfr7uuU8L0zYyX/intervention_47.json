I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she kept reminding him to renew it, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. She's thinking of not helping and letting him deal with it, so she can go on vacation alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. The author did bring it up multiple times, even had conflicts. She's not the one who holds his passport, so she can't renew it for him. If she's already done her part by reminding and pushing, then it's on him to act. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a shared responsibility in a relationship? Like, even if it's his passport, she might feel responsible because they're planning a trip together. But legally and practically, the responsibility lies with the individual. If he didn't act despite her warnings, can she be blamed? \n\nAlso, the cost is $1000 each. If he misses the trip, she might lose her money, but she's choosing to go alone. That could be seen as being responsible for her own part. However, maybe she should have checked earlier if he had his passport ready. But the problem is that he didn't renew it. \n\nThe key points: She tried to get him to renew it, he didn't. She's not forcing him to go; it's his choice if he doesn't act. So she's not in the wrong for not intervening further. It's his responsibility. Therefore, answer B.\n"
