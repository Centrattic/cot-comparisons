I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport ruin their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times, even leading to arguments. They booked a trip in November, and now the deadline for renewing the passport is approaching. The author is considering not helping and just going alone if the boyfriend doesn't get it done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should contribute to planning a trip, especially one that's expensive. The boyfriend didn't renew his passport despite repeated reminders, which is his responsibility. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. Now, the author is thinking of letting the consequences happen. \n\nIs it fair for the author to go alone? Well, the boyfriend's inaction is his fault. The author has done their part by bringing it up. The financial aspect is a factor too\u2014$1000 each is a big loss, but maybe non-refundable. The author might feel responsible, but if the boyfriend didn't take action, the blame is on him. \n\nBut should the author have done more? Maybe check the passport dates together or set reminders? However, the boyfriend was juvenile and the author felt like a parent. If the boyfriend wasn't proactive, the author isn't at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't responsible for the boyfriend's neglect. Letting him face the consequences is fair.\n"
