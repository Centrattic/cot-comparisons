I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The main points are: the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, she's brought it up multiple times, they had arguments, they booked the trip in November, and she's considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nFirst, responsibility for the passport. Legally, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. So she can't be held responsible for his expired passport. However, since they're a couple and planning a trip together, maybe there's an expectation of mutual support. But does that mean she's at fault if he doesn't follow through? \n\nShe's been trying to get him to renew it. She mentioned bringing it up several times and even had tiffs. That shows she made an effort. If he didn't take action despite being reminded, the onus is on him. The question is whether she's being an asshole by not intervening now. \n\nSome might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so she should have nagged more or helped him renew it. But others might say that after repeated reminders and arguments, it's his responsibility. Letting him face the consequences could be a lesson. \n\nAlso, the cost is a factor. The trip is expensive, and if she cancels, they both lose money. But if she goes alone, she's out of pocket, but he's the one who didn't act. Maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried and he didn't listen. \n\nIn terms of the dynamic, she mentions he's juvenile and the mother-child dynamic. That might indicate a pattern where he doesn't take responsibility, and she's tired of it. Her decision to let him face the consequences could be a way to enforce accountability. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like she's not in the wrong. She did her part, and the responsibility for his passport was his. So the answer is B.\n"
