I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not helping their boyfriend renew his passport before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November, and the deadline is approaching.\n\nThe author's plan is to not say anything and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences if he doesn't get the passport renewed in time, meaning she'll go alone. The key points here are responsibility and accountability. The boyfriend has had over a year to address his expired passport, and the author had been reminding him. The cost of the trip is also a factor\u2014$1000 isn't trivial, so both have invested significant money. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents. The author tried to prompt him multiple times. If she's not helping now and he doesn't act in time, he's choosing to miss the trip due to his own negligence. The author isn't directly causing the problem; she's removing her support because he hasn't taken responsibility. However, maybe she should have set clearer boundaries earlier or ensured there was a plan in place. But given the timeline and his inaction despite her reminders, it's possible she's not at fault. \n\nBut wait, the trip is a shared plan, so maybe she has a role in ensuring both can go. If the boyfriend's passport is his responsibility, but she's the one who handled booking, maybe she should have held him more accountable before the deadline. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong by not stepping in now. If he didn't take action after multiple warnings, her hands-off approach could be justified. She's not causing the passport issue, just not intervening further. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the responsibility lies with the boyfriend for his own passport. The author tried to get him to act, and if he's still not doing it, she's not the one at fault for not helping now. She's allowing him to face the consequences of his own inaction.\n"
