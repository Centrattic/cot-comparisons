I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before the trip. The author's boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried multiple times to get him to renew it, even arguing about it. Now, with the trip booked and paid for, the author is considering not helping anymore and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has clearly made an effort to remind and push the boyfriend to renew his passport, which is necessary for international travel. The boyfriend's responsibility is to take care of his own documents. If he didn't act despite being warned, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. However, in a relationship, there's often an expectation of mutual support. Even though the passport is his responsibility, if the author didn't follow up directly or take any action to ensure he handled it, they might share some responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has paid for the trip, so if they go alone, they're out of money and the experience. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as negligent, especially since he had multiple chances to renew. The author's decision to let him face the consequences could be justified as accountability for his own actions. But maybe the author should have taken a more direct approach, like helping him renew it or not going at all to avoid wasting money.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author do enough to ensure the passport was renewed? If they brought it up several times and even had arguments, but still didn't step in to help him renew it, maybe they're partially at fault. However, if the boyfriend ignored all the reminders and the author is now being honest about not helping further, then the boyfriend is responsible. The author might not be in the wrong for not taking more drastic steps beyond reminding. But if they knew the deadline was approaching and didn't take any concrete steps to enforce it, perhaps they are partly to blame.\n\nAlso, considering the financial aspect, the author is losing money. If they had a plan B or set boundaries from the start, maybe the situation would be different. But the author is now choosing to go on the trip without him, which could be seen as a consequence of his inaction. However, the question is whether the author is an asshole. If the author is being honest and not hiding anything, and the boyfriend knew the risks, then the author might not be in the wrong. It's about accountability. The boyfriend's negligence led to the problem, so the author isn't at fault for not taking further action once they've done their part.\n"
