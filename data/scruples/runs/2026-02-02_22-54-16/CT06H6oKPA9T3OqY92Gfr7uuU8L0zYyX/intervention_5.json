I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even leading to arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author has clearly tried to address the issue multiple times, which shows they were proactive. The boyfriend's responsibility is to renew his passport, which is his personal legal document. The author can't be held responsible for his actions unless there's a shared responsibility agreement, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author is now deciding to let the consequences happen. The question is whether this makes them an asshole. From a fairness standpoint, the author did their part by reminding and discussing the issue. The boyfriend didn't act, so the author isn't necessarily at fault. Relationships require mutual responsibility, and if one person isn't meeting their obligations, the other might have to make a decision about how to proceed. The author's choice to not intervene further might be seen as holding the boyfriend accountable for his own actions, which is reasonable. However, some might argue that the author should have taken more steps, like helping to renew the passport or booking a new one. But since the boyfriend never acted on the warnings, the author's hands are tied. The financial loss is on the boyfriend, which he might regret, but the author isn't in the wrong for not covering for his negligence. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
