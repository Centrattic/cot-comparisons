I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, she's mentioned it multiple times, they had some arguments, and she's decided to go on the trip alone if he doesn't fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibility here. She's been aware of the passport issue for a long time and brought it up several times. They even had tiffs about it, which suggests that she's made it clear how important this is. The trip was booked in November, and now they're approaching the deadline for passport renewal. \n\nShe's considering not helping him deal with the problem and letting him face the consequences. The key question is whether she's responsible for his actions here. Since the passport is his responsibility, and she's given him multiple chances to take care of it, maybe she's not at fault. However, some might argue that in a relationship, partners support each other, so maybe she should have taken more proactive steps to ensure he got it done.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's repeatedly told him and he hasn't acted, she might not be responsible for his negligence. The cost of the trip is significant, and she doesn't want to waste her money. Letting him handle it could be seen as holding him accountable. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the trip being a shared plan. If she goes alone, he loses the trip, but if she cancels, maybe they both lose out. However, she's saying she's not going to say anything and let him deal with it, which might not be the most communicative approach. Maybe a better solution would be to discuss consequences earlier, like canceling the trip if the passport isn't renewed, but she's choosing not to communicate now.\n\nThe community's perspective on AITA cases often leans towards personal responsibility. If the boyfriend didn't take care of his passport despite being told, he's at fault. However, if she enabled him by not taking more direct action earlier, maybe she's partly to blame. But given the information, she seems to have done her part, so the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
