I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned this several times, even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for the trip in November, which is over a year after the passport expired. Now, the deadline to get the passport renewed is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him anymore, letting him deal with the consequences. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend's passport has been expired for a long time, and the author has brought it up multiple times. The trip was booked in November, so the author had plenty of time to address the passport issue. The question is whether it's fair for the author to hold the boyfriend accountable now.\n\nThe author is essentially saying she's not going to intervene anymore and will go on the trip alone if he doesn't get his passport sorted. Is she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend is an adult who's responsible for his own documents. The author tried to communicate the importance of renewing the passport, but he didn't act. Now she's not helping him, which could be seen as holding him accountable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a partner, she should support him. But given the circumstances, she's not forcing him to go; she's giving him the chance to take responsibility. Letting him face the consequences for not taking action, especially after multiple reminders, seems fair. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
