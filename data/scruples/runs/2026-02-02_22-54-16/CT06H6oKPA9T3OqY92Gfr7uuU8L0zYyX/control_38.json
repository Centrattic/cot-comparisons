I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The author says they've brought up the issue multiple times, even had arguments, and now they're considering not helping and just going alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners usually share responsibilities for planning trips, especially something as crucial as a passport. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, so maybe he's been negligent in renewing it. The author tried to bring it up several times, which shows they were concerned. But the trip was booked in November, and the deadline is now approaching. The author is choosing not to push further, which could mean the boyfriend didn't take the necessary steps. \n\nIs the author responsible for making sure the boyfriend's passport is renewed? That's a key point. While couples do help each other with important tasks, ultimately, each person is individually responsible for their own travel documents. The author did their part by reminding him, but if the boyfriend didn't act on it, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. However, the author is now considering letting him face the consequences, which could be seen as punishing him for not taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is facing a significant financial loss if the trip is canceled or if they have to reschedule. If the boyfriend's negligence is causing that, the author might feel justified in not helping further. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The relationship dynamic where the author feels like a parent to a child might influence this. If the author has been taking on more responsibility, there could be an imbalance. \n\nAlso, the author is aware of the deadline and the consequences. By not intervening now, they're allowing the situation to play out. The other person might be at fault for not acting earlier, but the author's inaction now could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author might be using the trip as a consequence, which could be harsh. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't necessarily wrong if they've done their part in reminding him. The decision to let him handle it might be a lesson for him to take responsibility. However, the trip is a shared commitment, and the author is willing to let him miss out, which could be seen as holding their end of the bargain while the boyfriend didn't. \n\nBut people often expect support in relationships, even for things like travel plans. If the boyfriend needed help renewing his passport and the author had the means to assist more actively (like helping with the renewal process or reminding him more effectively), maybe the author is partially at fault for not doing enough. However, the boyfriend's own neglect might be the main issue here. \n\nConsidering all this, the main responsibility for the passport renewal lies with the individual. The author tried to bring it up, so they might not be entirely at fault. Letting him deal with the consequences could be a way to enforce accountability, so the answer might be B (No), but it's a bit tricky because it depends on how proactive the author was in helping him renew it. If the author just reminded him and didn't offer to help more, maybe they could be seen as not taking enough action. But given the information, the author seems to have done their part. So the answer is B.\n"
