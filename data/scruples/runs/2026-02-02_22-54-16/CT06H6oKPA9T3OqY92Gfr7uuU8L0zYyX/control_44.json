      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend have been together over a year and are planning a trip to another country in March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought this up multiple times, even causing some arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The deadline for getting the passport renewed is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend deal with it, possibly missing the trip so the author can go alone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend is an adult, so renewing a passport is his responsibility. But the author has repeatedly tried to get him to do it, even had arguments. However, the author is now thinking of not pushing further. Is it fair for the author to let him face the consequences?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, and the author is frustrated. But the trip was booked after the passport was already expired, which might mean the author knew the risk but still went ahead. So maybe the author shares some responsibility for not ensuring the passport was renewed before booking.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by not intervening. The boyfriend is an adult, so he should be responsible for his documents. However, in a relationship, partners often help each other with things like this. The author has tried multiple times, but the boyfriend didn't act. Now, the author might feel justified in not helping further, especially if the boyfriend is juvenile and the author feels like a parent.\n\nHowever, the trip was a shared decision and expense. If the author goes on the trip without the boyfriend, it might seem like they're abandoning him, even if he's at fault. But the author could also argue that the boyfriend's irresponsibility is his own problem, and the author shouldn't have to bail him out every time.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be using this as a way to teach the boyfriend a lesson. But is that fair? If the author is willing to let him face the consequences, maybe it's a valid point that the boyfriend should learn responsibility. However, the trip is expensive, and the author is paying for their own ticket, so the author isn't wasting money on the boyfriend's mistake.\n\nBut the author might be in a position where they feel the boyfriend isn't changing, so this could be a wake-up call. On the other hand, maybe the author should have done more to ensure the passport was renewed, like accompanying him to the office or helping with the process. But the author says they brought it up several times, so maybe that's enough.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often help each other with travel documents in a relationship. If the boyfriend is ignoring the issue, the author might be justified in not helping further. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the boyfriend's responsibility and the author's prior attempts to address it. The author isn't forcing him to renew; they've just stopped pushing. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
