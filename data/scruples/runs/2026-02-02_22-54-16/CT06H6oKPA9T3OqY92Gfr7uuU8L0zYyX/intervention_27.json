I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire. The author's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport, even though she mentioned it multiple times. They paid a lot for the trip, and now she's considering not saying anything and going alone if he doesn't get it done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should share the responsibility of travel documents, especially when planning an international trip. If she's been reminding him and he's ignored it despite the consequences, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But she's the one who's not taking action now. \n\nThe boyfriend's responsibility is clear. He needed to renew his passport. The author did her part by reminding him. If he didn't act on it, maybe she's justified in not helping anymore. However, is it fair for her to go on the trip without him? The trip was booked for both. If she goes alone, she's leaving him to deal with the problem, which he caused. But maybe she's also avoiding conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have taken more proactive steps earlier, like setting a deadline or helping him get it renewed. But the situation says she did bring it up several times. The final decision is to not say anything and let him handle it. That could be seen as a consequence for his inaction. \n\nI think the key here is that the boyfriend didn't take responsibility. The author tried to communicate but he didn't follow through. So, she's not in the wrong by not intervening further. The answer might be B, no.\n"
