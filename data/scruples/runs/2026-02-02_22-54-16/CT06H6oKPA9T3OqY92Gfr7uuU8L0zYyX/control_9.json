I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire. The situation is that they're planning a trip, but the boyfriend didn't renew his passport on time. The author has brought it up several times, even had arguments, and now she's considering not saying anything and going on the trip alone.\n\nHmm. So, first, the key points here. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times. They paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline for sending the passport is approaching. The author is thinking of not helping and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate from both sides. On one hand, she's responsible for bringing up the passport issue multiple times. He's been neglecting it despite her reminders. She's even had arguments about it. So maybe she's done her part. On the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, especially when planning something expensive like a trip, both partners should support each other. She might be seen as abandoning him because he didn't listen, but others might say he's responsible for his own passport.\n\nBut wait, in many relationships, couples do share responsibilities. However, the passport is a personal document. But when planning a trip, both need to be accountable. If she's been nagging him and he didn't act, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But if she didn't follow up more effectively, maybe she did something wrong. Also, she's considering leaving him to face the consequences. Some might say that's harsh, but others might see it as holding him accountable.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer based on the analysis. So, considering that she did point out the problem multiple times, and he didn't take action, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe she should have done something more proactive, like helping him renew it. However, the question is about the act of letting him deal with it now. If she's in a dynamic where he's being irresponsible, maybe she's justified in not bailing him out. But if she has a duty to help, then she's wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because she's held him accountable, and he's responsible for his own passport.\n"
