I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even arguing over it. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The author is considering not helping him anymore and going alone if he doesn't get his passport in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is at fault. The key points here are that she was aware of the passport issue for a long time and had already had arguments about it. She's made an active decision not to intervene now, even though she's planning to go on the trip. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, but the author has been involved in the situation by bringing it up and paying for the trip. \n\nThe question is whether her decision to let him deal with it on his own is justified. If she's not helping and not reminding him now, is that her fault? Well, she's already tried to get him to renew it before, and he didn't act. Now, the deadline is approaching, and she's choosing not to push further. She's not directly causing the passport to be expired, but she's aware of the problem and hasn't taken steps to solve it. \n\nSome might argue that since she's planning a trip with him, she should have made sure he had his passport renewed earlier. However, the responsibility for one's own travel documents typically lies with the individual. Even though she brought it up, she can't force him to act. But if she's the one who booked the trip, maybe she has some responsibility to ensure he can join. However, the user's argument is that she's tired of dealing with his irresponsibility and is choosing to take a stand by going alone. \n\nOn the other hand, letting him miss the trip because of his own inaction could be seen as unfair to him, but considering the financial investment and the prior arguments, she might feel justified. The \"asshole\" aspect depends on whether she's being negligent in not helping when she could, but if she's already tried and he didn't take action, then maybe she's not at fault. \n\nI think B (No) is the answer here because the author has done what she could by reminding him multiple times and arguing about it. The responsibility for his passport is his, and she's now choosing to proceed without him, which is within her rights given the context. She's not the one who caused the passport to expire, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
