I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now they've booked a trip, and the boyfriend didn't get his passport renewed on time. The author is considering not saying anything and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it sorted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The passport is his responsibility. The author has brought it up several times, so maybe they did their part in reminding him. But is it the author's responsibility to ensure he gets it done? In a relationship, sometimes you take care of each other's tasks, but passports are personal and legal documents. The boyfriend is an adult, so maybe it's his own responsibility.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he acts juvenile and the dynamic feels like parent-child. That might influence their decision to not help anymore. But does that justify letting him miss the trip? The cost was $1000 each, so there's financial loss involved. The author is planning to go alone, which could be seen as a punishment. Is that fair? If the author knew the deadline, and didn't remind him once more, maybe they could be seen as not fully supporting him. But if they've already done enough, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether the author is an asshole. The community often looks at intent and actions. The author tried to communicate, but the boyfriend didn't act. If the author's intent is to let him take responsibility, maybe that's fair. But intentionally letting him miss out might be seen as harsh. However, since the passport is his own, the consequences fall on him.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They've done their part by reminding him and even having arguments. The boyfriend is ultimately responsible for his own documents. The author isn't obligated to take full blame here. So the answer should be B.\n"
