      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire and then going on the trip alone. The author of the post is considering not helping their boyfriend and letting him handle the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend has had an expired passport since 2018. The author has mentioned it several times, and even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which costs $1000 each. Now, the deadline is approaching for the passport to be sent in. The author is thinking of not helping and going on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport sorted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend's responsibility for his passport, the author's attempts to address it, and the decision to let him deal with it. The author feels the boyfriend is juvenile and sometimes has a mother-child dynamic. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not helping anymore.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend didn't take the necessary steps to renew his passport despite being reminded. It's his responsibility. On the other hand, the author is the one who booked the trip with both of them in mind. But since the trip is paid for by both, maybe the author could be seen as not following through if they go alone. However, the author might argue that the boyfriend is at fault for not taking care of his own documents.\n\nThe author has tried to bring it up multiple times, so they aren't entirely to blame. The boyfriend's negligence is the main issue. By not helping, the author is holding him accountable. But if they go alone, they're also not helping him get his passport done. However, the author might feel that this is the consequence he needs to face for his own actions.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the trip costs $1000 each. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his money. But that's his responsibility. The author might not feel responsible for his mistake. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the author mentions feeling like a mother figure, which could imply that the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility. By letting him face the consequences, the author is perhaps trying to encourage responsibility. However, this could also be seen as harsh if the author doesn't help at all. But since the author has already tried multiple times, maybe they're justified in stepping back.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the primary responsibility lies with the boyfriend to renew his passport. The author did their part by reminding him and trying to get him to act. The consequence of missing the trip is on him for not acting on time. The author's decision to not help further and go on the trip alone is a valid choice here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
