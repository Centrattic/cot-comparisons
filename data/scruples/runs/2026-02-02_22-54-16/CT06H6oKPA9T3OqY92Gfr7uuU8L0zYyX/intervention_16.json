I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip. The author is considering not helping anymore and letting him deal with the consequences, which would mean she goes on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline is approaching for him to renew his passport. The author is planning to not say anything and let him handle it, essentially cutting him off responsibility-wise.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong by doing this. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, let's break it down. The author has tried to address the issue repeatedly. The boyfriend's responsibility is to get his passport renewed. While the author has a valid concern about his irresponsibility, the passport is his document. She can't renew it for him; he has to take action. If he failed to act despite her reminders, maybe she's not at fault here. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should help each other with such important matters. But the author has already tried and is now stepping back. She's not forcing him to go; he's the one who didn't prioritize the renewal. The money is spent, but if he doesn't fix it, he can't go. She's choosing to go on the trip she paid for, which is her right. \n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she's not responsible for his actions. He had the opportunity to renew his passport and didn't. She's setting boundaries here, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
