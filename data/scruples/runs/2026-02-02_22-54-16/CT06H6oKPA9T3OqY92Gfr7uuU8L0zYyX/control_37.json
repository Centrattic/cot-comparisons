I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport since May 2018, and the author has brought it up several times. They even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for a trip in November, and now the deadline for him to renew is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences, so she can go on her own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The author has a boyfriend who is an adult, responsible for his own passport. However, she's been aware of the issue for a long time and has tried to address it. She even mentions having tiffs over it. Now that the trip is booked, she's thinking of not helping and making him face the consequences. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The boyfriend is an adult and should be responsible for his own documents. 2) The author has already tried to bring it up multiple times. 3) The trip is expensive, and she's considering leaving him to go alone. \n\nIf the author decides not to help, is that fair? Well, maybe she's holding him accountable for his own actions. But they are a couple, and the trip is a joint activity. If she leaves him, she's using his negligence against him. However, she's not forcing him to go; she's just not helping. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have pushed harder to ensure he renewed his passport. But since she's already tried multiple times and had arguments, maybe she's done her part. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not in the wrong, then answer B. If she is, answer A. \n\nI think the boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. The author tried to address the issue, so she's not at fault. Letting him face the consequences might be harsh, but it's a lesson for him. However, maybe she should have done more, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's not responsible for his actions, even though she brought it up. She's choosing to take responsibility for her own actions and not enable his negligence.\n"
