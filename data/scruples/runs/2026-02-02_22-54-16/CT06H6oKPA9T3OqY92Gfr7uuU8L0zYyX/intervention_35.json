      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which costs $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching for renewing the passport, and the author is considering not saying anything and letting him handle it, even if he misses the trip. The author loves the boyfriend but feels a mother-child dynamic sometimes, which might explain their frustration.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole for doing this. Let's consider the responsibilities here. Both partners are going on the trip together. The passport is necessary for international travel, so it's a critical document. The boyfriend's responsibility is to have his passport renewed. However, the author has tried to bring it up multiple times and even had tiffs over it. That shows they've made an effort to address the issue.\n\nNow, the author is thinking of letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences. Is this fair? On one hand, the boyfriend is ultimately responsible for his own passport. It's not the author's duty to remind him or handle the renewal for him. If he didn't act on the reminders, maybe the consequences are his own. On the other hand, the author is going to spend money and the trip was planned together. If the trip is canceled because of his expired passport, the author might lose the money, and there's a risk of being stranded or having to pay for a last-minute passport, which could be stressful.\n\nBut the author's plan is to not say anything and let him take responsibility. That could be seen as a hard lesson. However, maybe the author should have intervened more, like helping him renew the passport, even if it's his responsibility. But the author might feel they've done their part by bringing it up multiple times. If the boyfriend is juvenile and not taking things seriously, the author might be trying to set boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking the trip on their own, which might mean the boyfriend is left out. But since it's an international trip, they can't go without a valid passport. The author isn't preventing him from going; they're just not helping him. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they've done their part in warning him. The boyfriend's inaction is his own fault.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, partners support each other. If the author knew there was a risk, maybe they should have helped more, like accompanying him to renew the passport or making sure it was done. But if the boyfriend refused to act despite multiple reminders, the author might feel justified in not stepping in further.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: $1000 each is a significant amount. If the trip is non-refundable, the author might lose that money. But if the boyfriend misses the trip, he's not contributing to the cost. That could be seen as unfair. However, the author might have considered that and decided it's better to take the loss than to enable his irresponsible behavior.\n\nIn summary, the author has tried multiple times to address the issue. The responsibility of the passport renewal lies with the boyfriend. If he didn't act on his own, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not stepping in further. So the answer is B (No).\n"
