I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the person has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which cost $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching, and the person plans to let the boyfriend handle it if he doesn't get it done, and go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend's passport was expired for a long time, and the author tried to get him to renew it. They even had conflicts over it. The author has a right to expect that their partner would take responsibility for their own documents, especially since the trip was booked months in advance. If the boyfriend didn't act on the warnings, then he's the one who failed to meet the necessary requirements. \n\nHowever, relationships often require support from both sides. The author might be frustrated with the boyfriend's irresponsibility. But by deciding to go on the trip alone, the author is essentially cutting the boyfriend off from the consequences. The author isn't helping, but they also aren't forcing the boyfriend to fix the situation. The question is whether the author is at fault for not intervening. Since the author has already tried to communicate the issue multiple times and the boyfriend didn't take action, the author isn't responsible for the passport expiring. The fault lies with the boyfriend for not acting on the warnings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences now.\n"
