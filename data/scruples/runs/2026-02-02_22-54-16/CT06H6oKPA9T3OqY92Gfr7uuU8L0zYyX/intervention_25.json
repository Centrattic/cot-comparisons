I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend whose passport expired, and the author is considering letting him miss their trip because he didn't renew it in time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching, and the author is planning to go alone if he doesn't get it done. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping or reminding him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to get him to renew the passport, which he didn't do. So maybe she's not at fault. On the other hand, maybe she should have pushed harder or helped more. But the boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. The author can't force him. If she's already tried multiple times and he ignored it, then she's done her part.\n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is a mother-child feeling. Maybe that's why she's frustrated. But she's not a parent. The responsibility lies with him. The trip is expensive, and she's trying to avoid financial loss, but that's her choice. Letting him miss the trip could be a consequence for his own inaction. So, in that case, she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
