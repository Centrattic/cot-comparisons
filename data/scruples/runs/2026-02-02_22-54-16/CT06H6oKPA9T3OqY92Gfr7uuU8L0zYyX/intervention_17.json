I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. They even had arguments about it. She paid $1000 each for the trip, and now she's considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get his passport in time, so she can go on vacation alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author has repeatedly tried to remind her boyfriend about the passport. He's been irresponsible, and they had tiffs about it. She's even booked the trip after November. Now, she's thinking of letting him miss out because he didn't take action. The question is whether she's in the wrong by doing that.\n\nOn one hand, she's taking responsibility for her own actions. She's not forcing him to go on the trip; it's his choice to renew his passport. The passport is his, and he's the one who needs to act. She's given him multiple chances, and if he didn't take her reminders seriously, it's his fault. She's not stopping him from getting his passport, just not helping further. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a partner, she should have taken more steps to ensure the trip happens. Maybe she should have reminded him more insistently or even helped him renew the passport herself. But the post says she brought it up several times and even had arguments. She's done her part, and now he's the one who failed to act.\n\nAnother point is the financial aspect. She paid $1000 each. If he can't go, she might lose the money, but the question is about her being an asshole. The key is whether she's being unfair by not helping him now. Since he's been given many opportunities to act, and she's not forcing him to go, her choice to proceed without him might be justifiable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on intent and actions. The author's intent seems to be holding accountability. She's not being malicious, just letting him take responsibility. Her boyfriend was negligent, and she's not enabling his behavior by stepping back. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
