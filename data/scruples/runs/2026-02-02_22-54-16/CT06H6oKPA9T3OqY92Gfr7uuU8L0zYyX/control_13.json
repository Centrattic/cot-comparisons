I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The key points here are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not helping him and just going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, which is a personal document. The author has tried to remind him multiple times, so maybe she's done her part. However, letting him deal with the consequences might be harsh, especially since the trip is expensive and they both paid for it. Is she being selfish by going alone? Or is she justified in not taking responsibility for his inaction?\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer. If the author is in the wrong, it's because maybe she should help despite his negligence. If not, maybe because he's responsible for his own passport. The author's intention is to let him face the consequences, which could be seen as a way to teach him responsibility. But it might also be seen as abandoning him, especially after investing money together. However, the boyfriend's own inaction over a long period is a factor. If the author had no means to enforce him to renew his passport, perhaps she's not at fault. Also, the dynamic mentioned (feeling like a mother and child) suggests a possible imbalance in their relationship, but that's not directly related to the passport issue. The main issue is responsibility. The author isn't responsible for his passport, so not helping might be fair. But if she's letting him off the hook without trying to help one last time, maybe she is at fault. Hmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the passport is his responsibility, and she's holding him accountable. But if she could have helped more, maybe A. However, the user says she's not going to say anything and let him deal with it. Is that being an asshole? It's a tough call. I think the consensus would lean towards B, as he's responsible for his own documents. But some might argue she should have intervened more. However, given the information, the answer is B.\n"
