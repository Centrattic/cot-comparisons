I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The author's boyfriend has an expired passport since May 2018, and she's been bringing it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Then they booked and paid a $1000 each trip for March. Now the deadline is approaching for him to get his passport renewed, and the author is considering just not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences, meaning she'll go on the trip alone if he's unprepared.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the boyfriend's responsibility to have a valid passport and the author's role in reminding him. She's mentioned she's brought it up several times and they had tiffs over it. So she's tried to communicate the issue. The question is whether it's her fault if she doesn't push him anymore and he doesn't get it done. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. Even if the author kept reminding him, if he consistently ignored it, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. However, she's also considering letting him face the consequences without giving a final heads-up, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. \n\nBut the core issue is whether she's in the wrong. If she's already made her intentions known and he didn't take action, then she's not obligated to keep reminding him. The problem arises from his lack of responsibility, not necessarily her decision to stop reminding him. However, some might argue that as a partner, she has a duty to ensure both can attend the trip, but realistically, each person should handle their own passports. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong if the boyfriend didn't act despite her previous attempts. But she might be seen as a bit harsh if she doesn't give one last warning. However, in the context of the dynamic where she feels like the \"mother,\" maybe she's justified in not continuing to nag. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his passport is his own. The author's attempts to communicate are sufficient, and it's not her fault if he doesn't follow up. She's not the asshole here.\n"
