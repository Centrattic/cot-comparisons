I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The key points are:\n\n1. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the person has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it.\n2. They booked and paid $1000 each for a trip in March. The deadline to send the passport for renewal is approaching.\n3. The author is planning not to warn the boyfriend, letting him face the consequences, so they can go on the trip alone.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question hinges on whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances.\n\nFirst, responsibility: The boyfriend had the responsibility to renew his passport. The author has mentioned it multiple times, so they tried to help. However, the decision to not intervene anymore is the author's choice. \n\nBut then there's the financial aspect. They both paid for the trip. If he can't go due to his own negligence, the author might feel justified in going without him. However, there's a potential for emotional harm. The author might be seen as abandoning the relationship issues, especially since they mentioned feeling like a parent. \n\nEthically, did the author have an obligation to remind him one more time? They might argue they tried enough, but others might say they should have insisted. Also, the cost is a factor\u2014the author is using their own money for the trip, but maybe they should have considered the joint booking.\n\nAnother angle: The author is using this as a way to deal with the boyfriend's irresponsibility. If the boyfriend had the chance to renew his passport and didn't, the author isn't in the wrong. But if there was a last chance and the author didn't nudge, maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the responsibility lies with the boyfriend. The author tried, and if he didn't act, she's not obligated to bail him out, especially after repeated warnings. However, some might argue she should have made one final effort. But given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
