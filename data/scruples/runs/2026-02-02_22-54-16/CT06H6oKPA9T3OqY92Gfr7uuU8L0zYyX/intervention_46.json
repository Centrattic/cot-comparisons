I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they booked together. The main points here are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, the author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and the deadline is approaching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author has clearly tried to get the boyfriend to renew his passport before. They've brought it up several times and even had tiffs. So, it's not like they ignored the issue. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't take action until it was too late. The author is now considering not saying anything else and letting him face the consequences.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is at fault for not pushing further or not taking more action. Some might argue that the author should have taken a more active role, like helping him renew the passport or covering the cost. But the author hasn't done that, and maybe the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. Others might say that in a relationship, especially when planning something expensive, both partners have shared responsibilities, and the author should have been more proactive.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a mother-child dynamic. They feel the boyfriend is juvenile and maybe not taking things seriously. By letting him face the consequences, the author is setting a boundary. However, some people might see this as cruel, especially since the trip is already booked and paid for. But the author is not forcing the boyfriend to go; they are just not helping him anymore.\n\nI should also think about whether the author has a duty to warn or assist in this case. Since the boyfriend's own actions (or inactions) led to the passport expiring, the author's responsibility might be limited. The boyfriend had the opportunity to renew it but didn't. The author has already tried to communicate, so if he still doesn't act, maybe it's his own fault.\n\nOn the other hand, if the trip is a shared expense, the author might feel it's unfair to pay for it without him. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping him. If the boyfriend had the means to renew it but chose not to, the author isn't necessarily responsible for his inaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their concerns known, and the boyfriend didn't take responsibility. The author is now choosing to let him face the consequences, which is a valid decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
