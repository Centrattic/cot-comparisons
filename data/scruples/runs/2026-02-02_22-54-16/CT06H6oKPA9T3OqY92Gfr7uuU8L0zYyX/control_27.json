I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The scenario is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried multiple times to get him to renew it. They had a fight about it, and now they've booked a trip for March. The author is considering not helping him anymore and just going on the trip alone if he doesn't sort it out in time.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend has been responsible for his own passport, but the author has been reminding him. However, the actual responsibility for getting a passport renewed lies with the individual. The author has done her part by bringing it up several times and even had conflicts about it. Now, she's considering stepping back and not helping further, which would let him face the consequences.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to leave him in the lurch? If she's the one who booked the trip and paid for both, maybe she's partially responsible? However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not helping anymore. If he's been neglecting his own responsibility, maybe she's justified in not helping. On the other hand, if she's in a committed relationship and they're planning a trip together, maybe she should have stepped in more to ensure they could both go.\n\nAnother angle: the emotional dynamic. She mentions he's juvenile and the relationship feels like a parent-child thing. This might mean that he's been relying on her to handle things, and she's tired of that. By not helping, she's setting a boundary. That could be seen as healthy.\n\nBut if she knew about the deadline and didn't remind him adequately, maybe she's at fault. However, the story says she's been bringing it up several times. The deadline is approaching, and she's giving him the final chance. If he's not taking initiative, then she's not to blame. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's held her end, he's responsible for his passport. Letting him face the consequences is a valid decision here.\n"
