I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. The trip is booked and paid for, costing $1000 each. The author plans to let the boyfriend handle the issue on his own and go on the trip without him if he doesn't get it done.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue here is responsibility. The boyfriend didn't renew his passport despite being reminded. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts. The trip is a shared expense and commitment. The author is considering bailing on the trip for him, but not helping.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA). The options are A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong). The answer must be just A or B.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the author proactive in reminding the boyfriend? Yes, several times and even had tiffs. Did the author have a financial stake in the trip? Yes, they paid $1000 each. Is the author planning to go alone if the boyfriend fails? That's the key point. The author is choosing not to help and let the consequences happen. \n\nPossible angles: The author could be seen as not supporting their partner through a mistake, but the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author's action might be a lesson in responsibility. Alternatively, maybe the author should have intervened more.\n\nBut the boyfriend is an adult. The author can't force him to renew his passport. The author's responsibility is to communicate and support, but the actual action is up to him. If the author has done their part in reminding and the boyfriend didn't act, then the author isn't in the wrong for not bailing him out. However, the trip is a shared expense, so maybe the author is being selfish by going on their own.\n\nBut the author mentions the boyfriend is juvenile and they feel like a mother. This dynamic might suggest the author has taken on too much responsibility. The author is now deciding to let him face the consequences, which could be a way to set boundaries. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on responsibility and communication. The author did their part. The boyfriend didn't act. So the author isn't the one at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would think the author should have helped more, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author isn't legally or ethically responsible for the boyfriend's passport, they aren't wrong for not helping. So B is correct.\n"
