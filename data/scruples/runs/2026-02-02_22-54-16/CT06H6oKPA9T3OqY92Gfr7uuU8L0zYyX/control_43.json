I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and despite the author bringing it up multiple times, it's still not renewed. They paid $1000 each for a trip, and the deadline is approaching. The author is planning not to say anything and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences, possibly missing the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who is responsible. The boyfriend is the one whose passport is expired, but the author has been reminding him. However, the passport is his own responsibility. Even though the author has brought it up, the decision to renew it should be his. The author might feel frustrated because he hasn't acted on the reminders, leading her to take a passive approach. \n\nIs the author at fault for not pushing harder? Maybe she could have insisted more, like setting a specific date to get it done or helping him renew it. But she did mention they had tiffs over it, which suggests conflict. On the other hand, if she's not going to go with him if he misses the deadline, is she being unfair? The trip is a shared expense, but the problem is his own documents. She might feel justified in not making excuses for him, especially if he's responsible for his own passport. \n\nAlso, the dynamic they mentioned\u2014feeling like a parent and child\u2014might play a role. If the boyfriend is acting juvenile, maybe the author is trying to enforce responsibility by not bailing him out. However, letting the trip happen without him could be harsh, especially since they both paid for it. She might be punishing him, but he's the one who didn't take action. \n\nI need to balance responsibility. She's not the one whose passport is expired, so she's not directly at fault. However, maybe she could have intervened more, but since it's his own responsibility, she's not legally or morally obligated to handle it for him. So, is she an asshole? Possibly not, because the responsibility lies with him. But maybe she could have done more to help or ensure he renewed his passport. However, given that she tried multiple times and he didn't act, her hands are tied. The answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
