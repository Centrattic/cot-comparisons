I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The key points here are responsibility, communication, and consequences.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author mentioned bringing it up several times and even had arguments about it. That shows they tried to address the issue. When they booked the trip in November, which is months before the deadline, the boyfriend still hadn't renewed it. The author's plan is to not mention it and let him deal with the consequences. \n\nNow, considering responsibility: the boyfriend has the primary responsibility to keep his passport valid, especially for a trip they've already paid for. The author did their part by reminding him multiple times. If he didn't act on that, the responsibility shifts to him. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author could have done more? Like setting a specific deadline or following up more closely. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's inaction despite multiple reminders might mean the author isn't at fault here. \n\nAlso, the author is considering letting him miss the trip intentionally. While that's harsh, it's a consequence of his actions. The author isn't forcing the situation; they're allowing the natural consequences to play out. \n\nIn relationships, support is important, but there's a line. If the boyfriend knew the deadline and failed to act, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not stepping in further. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's negligence is the main issue here, and the author tried to communicate the problem. Letting him face the consequences isn't being an asshole if he was given multiple chances.\n"
