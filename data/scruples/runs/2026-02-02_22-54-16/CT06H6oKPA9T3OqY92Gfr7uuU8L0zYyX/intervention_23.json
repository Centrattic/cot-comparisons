I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they booked. The author is considering not helping or reminding him anymore, even though they've had previous arguments about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The boyfriend had an expired passport since 2018, which the author mentioned they brought up several times. So the issue wasn't just a one-time thing. The trip was booked in November, and the passport deadline is approaching. The author is paying for the trip, which is $1000 each, a significant amount. \n\nNow, should the author be responsible for ensuring the boyfriend's passport is renewed? In many cases, when planning a trip, both parties should take responsibility for their own documents. The author did their part by reminding him, but if the boyfriend didn't act on it despite knowing the consequences, the fault might lie with him. However, the author is in a position where they could help by applying on his behalf or even paying for his passport renewal. But the author is choosing not to intervene anymore, which could be seen as a lack of support, especially if they had discussed and argued about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's responsibility is to maintain his own travel documents, but the author, being in a relationship, might be expected to offer some level of assistance. If the author had already given multiple chances and the boyfriend is still neglecting it, maybe the author is justified in stepping back. However, causing the boyfriend to miss the trip might result in the author losing the money, which could be a big hit. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is passive and lets it happen without further intervention, is that wrong? The key points are: the author tried several times, there were arguments, the deadline is now imminent. The author is not actively preventing the trip but is choosing not to help anymore. It's a bit of a grey area. Some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other through mistakes, even if it's their responsibility. Others might say the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, and the author has done enough.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the author has already done their part by reminding and arguing. The final responsibility lies with the boyfriend. However, there's a consideration of relationship dynamics. If the author is in a more dominant role, maybe they should have stepped in. But given the history, maybe not. I think the correct answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
