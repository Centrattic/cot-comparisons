I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it several times. They had a tiff over it, and now the trip is booked, and the deadline for getting the passport renewed is approaching. The author is considering not helping and letting him miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has tried to get him to renew his passport multiple times. The boyfriend is described as juvenile, and the author feels like a mother in the relationship. The cost of the trip is $1000 each, which is a significant expense. The author is now thinking about not intervening and letting him face the consequences if he doesn't renew the passport in time.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is the author responsible for her boyfriend's actions? Well, while they are a couple, each person is responsible for their own documents. The author can certainly express her concerns and push for action, but ultimately, the responsibility for his passport lies with him. However, the fact that the author has brought it up multiple times and even had arguments suggests that she has done her part to inform him. If he's not acting on the information, maybe he's at fault.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the financial loss. The trip is already paid for. If he misses the trip, the author would lose her money, but she's choosing to go on the trip without him. Is that selfish? Depending on the circumstances, if they were supposed to be going together, leaving him behind might be seen as abandoning him. However, if she's not helping and he's aware of the consequences, maybe it's his own fault for not taking responsibility.\n\nAlso, the dynamics mentioned\u2014her feeling like a mother and him being juvenile\u2014could indicate that there's a power imbalance. She might be frustrated with his lack of responsibility, and this situation is a culmination of that. But should she take the extreme step of not helping, even if it means he can't go?\n\nLegally and ethically, the responsibility for documents is individual. However, in a relationship, partners often support each other. But if one is not taking responsibility, the other can't be held accountable for their inaction. The author's decision not to help might be seen as a consequence of his own irresponsibility, but maybe she's also being harsh by not giving him one more push or even assisting in the process if possible.\n\nBut the author says she's not going to say anything and just let him deal with it. That seems passive-aggressive. Instead of helping him meet the deadline, she's choosing to let him face the consequences. This could be seen as cruel if she's aware he might miss the trip, but she's also protecting herself from his irresponsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport, the author's decision to do nothing could be seen as somewhat harsh, but perhaps not entirely her fault. However, since she's aware of the situation and has done her part, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. If she's done her part to inform and push, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility is on him. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
