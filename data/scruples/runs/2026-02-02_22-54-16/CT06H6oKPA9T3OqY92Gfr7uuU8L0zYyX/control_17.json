I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the writer has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, the trip is booked, and the deadline for renewing the passport is near. The writer plans to go on the trip alone if he doesn't get it in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend is the one whose passport is expired. The writer has mentioned it several times, so maybe he's aware but didn't act. However, is the writer responsible for ensuring he renews it? In a relationship, partners often share responsibilities, but personal documents like a passport are usually individual responsibility. The writer might have given reminders, but ultimately, the decision to act lies with the boyfriend.\n\nThen, the financial aspect. The trip cost $1000 each. If the writer goes alone, the boyfriend loses his money. But if the writer cancels the trip, maybe they can get a refund. However, the writer is not necessarily at fault if the boyfriend didn't take the necessary steps. The writer might feel frustrated, especially if the boyfriend is being irresponsible.\n\nEmotionally, the writer feels like they're in a parent-child dynamic. This could affect their relationship, but the current issue is about the passport. The writer's intention is to let the boyfriend face the consequences of his inaction. Is that being an asshole? It depends on intent. If the writer is trying to teach a lesson, maybe. But if they're just holding them accountable, perhaps not.\n\nLegal responsibility: The passport is the individual's responsibility. The writer can't renew it for him. So, if he didn't take the steps despite being reminded, the writer isn't necessarily at fault. However, if they had a shared responsibility or agreed to help, that's different. But from the description, it seems like the boyfriend didn't follow through.\n\nEthically, letting someone face the consequences of their own actions isn't necessarily wrong. But if the writer had a duty of care, like in a more dependent relationship, maybe. Here, they're both adults, and the passport is his to manage.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The writer isn't in the wrong because the passport is the boyfriend's responsibility. The writer tried to communicate and warned him, so if he didn't act, the consequences are his to bear. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
