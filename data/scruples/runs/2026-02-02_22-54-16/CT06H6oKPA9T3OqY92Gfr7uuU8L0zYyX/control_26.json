I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They paid a lot for the trip, and now the deadline to get the passport renewed is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences, which would mean he can't go on the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The author mentions that she has brought it up several times and even had tiffs. So she's tried to address the issue. But he hasn't acted on it. The key point here is whether she's responsible for making sure he gets his passport renewed. In a relationship, both partners have responsibilities. If one partner consistently ignores their own obligations, even after being reminded, does the other partner have a duty to push further, or is it the individual's own responsibility?\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they paid a significant amount for the trip. If she cancels because of his passport, he might lose the money. But if she goes without him, she still loses the money for her own ticket. However, she might save on some shared costs. But the main issue is whether she's being fair by not helping him anymore.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic mentioned\u2014she feels like a mother to a child. Maybe she's been overstepping in trying to manage his responsibilities when it's his own responsibility. If he's an adult, he should be responsible for his own passport. Even if she's tried to help, the ultimate responsibility lies with him. So if he didn't take action despite her reminders, maybe she isn't in the wrong for not intervening further.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a partner. Should she have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport herself if he wasn't doing it? Or is it his own responsibility to get it done? If she's made it clear multiple times and he hasn't acted, maybe she's done her part. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other through such issues. If she knew the consequences and still didn't act, she might be seen as selfishly choosing her own trip over being a partner. But if he's been neglectful, maybe she's justified in not helping further.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did she do enough to address the issue? She says she brought it up several times and had tiffs. So she's tried. 2) Is the passport his responsibility? Yes, he's an adult. 3) Is she being fair by not helping now? If he's been aware and didn't act, maybe she's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's held up her end by reminding him, and he's responsible for his own documents. However, others might think she should have stepped in more. But given the context, I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
