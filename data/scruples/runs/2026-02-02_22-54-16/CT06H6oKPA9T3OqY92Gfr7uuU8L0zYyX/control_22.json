I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a planned trip.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author mentions bringing it up multiple times and even having arguments over it. They paid for the trip in November, and the deadline to renew is approaching. The author plans to go on the trip alone if he doesn't get his passport renewed on time.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, but the author has been reminding him. However, the final responsibility lies with him to take action. If he didn't act despite being warned, the author might feel justified in proceeding without him. \n\nBut then, relationships require teamwork. Some might argue that the author could have helped more, like reminding him again closer to the deadline or even assisting with the renewal process. However, the author has already tried multiple times and even had conflicts over it. \n\nFinancial aspect: they paid $1000 each. If the trip is non-refundable, the author might be out of money either way. But the main issue is whether letting him face the consequences is fair. \n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend's responsibility, the author's repeated efforts, and the author's intention to proceed solo. The author isn't directly causing the passport to expire, but by not intervening further, they're letting the consequences happen. \n\nSome might say the author is in the right because the boyfriend was negligent. Others might say the author should have stepped in more. But given the information, the author did take action by reminding him multiple times and even had conflicts. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the final responsibility is on the boyfriend.\n"
