I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire and then not helping him, leading to him missing the trip.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline for the passport renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him, so he's on his own if he doesn't get it done.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? The author is taking a passive-aggressive approach. They've tried to communicate the problem, but now they're planning to let the consequences happen. The key points are responsibility sharing in a relationship and accountability.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners usually share responsibilities. If one person is in charge of something (like passport renewal), but the other has been aware and hasn't helped, maybe the author shares some blame. But wait, the boyfriend is the one who didn't renew his passport despite multiple reminders. The author has tried to be proactive. It's possible that the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, but the author kept reminding him. However, when they booked the trip, maybe the author should have insisted he renew it immediately rather than just reminding him. \n\nThe author is now planning to not help further, which could be seen as a form of punishment. But is that fair? If the boyfriend neglected his responsibility and the author gave him multiple chances, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The trip is expensive, and if the boyfriend's inaction leads to missing out, the author is protecting their own interests. But maybe the author should have intervened earlier instead of just letting it go to the last minute. \n\nAlso, considering the dynamic where the author feels like a mother figure, there's a power imbalance. The author might feel frustrated that they have to constantly remind him. However, relationships require teamwork. If one person is consistently neglecting their responsibilities, the other might feel justified in not helping further. \n\nOn the other hand, not saying anything when the deadline is close could be seen as abandoning the partner. The author might be using this as a lesson, but it's harsh because it's a significant financial and emotional loss for both. Maybe the author should have communicated better earlier. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The boyfriend for not renewing, but the author for not stepping in when it became critical. The author's approach is to let him face the consequences, which could be justified if they've tried enough. However, the financial loss is $1000 each, which is a lot. If the author had helped him renew the passport, maybe the problem could have been fixed. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to communicate and the boyfriend didn't act. But maybe there's a responsibility shared in a relationship to support each other in planning trips. Hmm. It's a tough call. But since the author has given multiple chances and now is not helping further, maybe that's their right. So answer B.\n"
