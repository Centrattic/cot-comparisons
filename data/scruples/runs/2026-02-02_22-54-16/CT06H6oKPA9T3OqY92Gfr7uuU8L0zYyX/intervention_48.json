I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport prevent the trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's been bringing it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now the trip is booked, and the deadline for renewing is approaching. The author is considering not helping him and just going on her own if he doesn't get it done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both people in a relationship should take responsibility for their own travel documents. The boyfriend has been negligent in renewing his passport, which is something each individual is responsible for. The author has tried to bring it up several times and even had conflicts. So she's done her part in reminding him.\n\nNow, the author is thinking of letting him deal with the consequences. The question is whether this makes her an asshole. From a fairness standpoint, she's not obligated to take responsibility for his actions. If he didn't take her reminders seriously, then it's his fault for not acting. The cost of the trip is a factor too. She paid $1000 each, and if he doesn't go, she might lose that, but maybe she's willing to take that loss as a lesson for him to be responsible.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other. But in this case, the support would require her to maybe push harder or help him get it done. But the author is choosing not to, which could be seen as a consequence for his irresponsibility. On the other hand, maybe she should have made it a non-negotiable condition before booking the trip. But she did book it after he still hadn't renewed, so she might have assumed he would handle it this time.\n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to punish him by going without him? If she goes on vacation without him, it might hurt him emotionally, but he's responsible for his actions. The author might be trying to teach him a lesson. Alternatively, she could be seen as being selfish for going on the trip if she knows he's going to miss it. But given that she's already made the decision and the money is spent, maybe she's not in the wrong because she warned him multiple times.\n\nI think the key points are: repeated reminders, his negligence, her not being responsible for his actions. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's holding him accountable for his own responsibilities.\n"
