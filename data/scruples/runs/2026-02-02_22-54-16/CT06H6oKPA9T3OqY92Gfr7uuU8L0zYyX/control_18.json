I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, the author has brought it up several times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching for the passport to be sent off, and the author is planning to not say anything so the boyfriend deals with the consequences, and she goes on vacation alone.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are responsibility, communication, and the consequences.\n\nThe author has mentioned the passport issue multiple times, and even had tiffs. So she did her part to bring it up. The boyfriend didn't act on it. Even if she's the one who brought it up, ultimately, the responsibility for his own passport lies with him. He's an adult, so he should manage his own documents. \n\nBut wait, in a relationship, sometimes people help each other with tasks. The author might have taken the lead in planning the trip, maybe even pushed for the renewal. However, if he didn't follow through despite her reminders, maybe she's not at fault. \n\nThe cost is $1000 each. If the trip is non-refundable, she might lose her money. But the question is about being an asshole. The author is choosing to not help him anymore, which could be seen as holding him accountable for his inaction. On the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so she should have pushed harder or helped him get it done.\n\nBut the boyfriend's behavior is described as juvenile, and the author feels like a parent. If he's been irresponsible, maybe she's justified in not helping further. However, letting him miss the trip could be seen as punishing him, but she's also the one who paid, and maybe she doesn't want to waste her money. \n\nThe key here is whether the responsibility is his. Since the passport is his, and he's an adult, the author isn't in the wrong for not taking action now. She did her part by bringing it up. If he didn't act, the consequence is on him. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe if she had more control over the situation, but she's not the one who can renew his passport. So she's not at fault.\n"
