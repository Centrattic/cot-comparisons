I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, the trip is booked, and the deadline for renewing is approaching. The author is considering not helping him and letting him deal with the consequences, so she can go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault here. The key points are: the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his passport, the author's repeated reminders, and her decision to not intervene further if he doesn't act. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, renewing a passport is an individual's own responsibility. Even in a relationship, each person is typically responsible for their own travel documents. The author has tried to bring it up several times and even had conflicts about it. That shows she made her concerns known. Now, if he didn't take action despite being warned, it's his fault. The author isn't obligated to keep reminding him indefinitely or to take action on his behalf, especially if he's not responsive.\n\nThe cost of the trip is $1000 each, which is a significant amount. The author might be trying to avoid financial loss, but if the trip is non-refundable, that's a separate issue. However, the question is more about moral responsibility rather than financial loss. \n\nThe dynamic mentioned is a mother-child-like relationship, where the boyfriend is described as juvenile. This might imply that he's not taking responsibility for his own actions, which the author is trying to address by stepping back. By letting him face the consequences, she's encouraging him to take responsibility. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's done her part by informing him and giving him chances, then she's not at fault. However, if she had the means to help him (like helping with the renewal process) and chose not to, that could be different. But the scenario doesn't mention her refusing to help; it's more that she's not going to intervene further once the deadline is near. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility ultimately lies with the boyfriend. She's made her position clear, and now the consequence is on him. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
