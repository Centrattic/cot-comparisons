I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire, leading to him missing their trip. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, which is a long time. The author mentions bringing it up multiple times and even having arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which was after the passport was already expired. The author now plans to go on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport renewed in time.\n\nI need to consider responsibility here. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own travel documents. However, the author might have a role in reminding him, especially since they're planning a joint trip. But if he's been neglecting it despite multiple reminders, maybe the author isn't fully at fault. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is being negligent by not taking action. The author is aware of the deadline and the consequences. By choosing to go alone, they're holding the boyfriend accountable for his own actions. However, some might argue that as a partner, the author should have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport or canceling the trip to avoid the situation. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend had the responsibility and the author did try to bring it up, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. On the other hand, not taking any action beyond verbal reminders might be seen as selfish. It's a balance between accountability and partnership. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. However, there's a nuance that as a partner, the author could have done more to ensure both could attend. But given the circumstances, the author's choice to let consequences happen might be justified.\n"
