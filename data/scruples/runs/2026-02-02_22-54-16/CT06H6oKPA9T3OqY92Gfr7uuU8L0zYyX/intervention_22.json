I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They had a couple of arguments about it, and they booked the trip in November. Now, the author is considering not helping him and just going on the trip alone if he messes up again. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess responsibility. The boyfriend didn't renew his passport, which is his own responsibility. The author has tried to point this out multiple times, even had conflicts over it. The trip was booked in November, so there's been enough time to handle the passport renewal. The author is now choosing not to help him, which could result in him missing the trip. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the passport renewal is his responsibility. The author has done her part by reminding him and even had arguments about it. She's not forcing him to go on the trip; she's just not going to intervene now. While it might seem harsh to leave him hanging, she's not the one who failed to act. The boyfriend is the one who didn't take action despite being warned. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a partner, she should have helped more. But the key here is whether she was negligent. She did bring it up several times. If she had done nothing, then maybe, but she tried. So, in this case, the decision to let him face the consequences isn't her being in the wrong. The boyfriend's inaction is the root cause. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
