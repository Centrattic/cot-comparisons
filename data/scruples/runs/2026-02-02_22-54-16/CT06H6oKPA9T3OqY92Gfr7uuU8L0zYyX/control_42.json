I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her boyfriend had a planned trip, which they paid for in November. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. He hasn't done it, leading to some arguments. Now, the deadline is approaching, and she's considering not helping him and going on the trip alone. She's asking if she's an a**hole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his passport, the author's repeated reminders, the financial investment, and her decision to let him face the consequences. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities can be a point of conflict. The author has made an effort to bring up the issue multiple times, which shows she's tried to address it. The boyfriend's inaction, despite being aware of the importance, is on him. The author's plan to proceed without him might be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other. But since the boyfriend was the one who neglected his duty, the author isn't at fault. She's not forcing him; she's allowing him to take responsibility for his own mistake. The money is a shared loss if the trip is canceled, but she's choosing to go, which could be seen as fair if he's the one who didn't act.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. If the author feels she's taking on a parental role, maybe this is a way to set boundaries. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since the problem stems from his inaction, and she's not the one who caused the passport to expire, she's not at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
