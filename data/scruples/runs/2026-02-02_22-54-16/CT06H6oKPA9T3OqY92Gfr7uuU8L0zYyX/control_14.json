I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and the author has been nagging him to renew it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Then they booked a trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching for him to get his passport renewed, and the author is considering not helping him anymore and just going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is primarily responsible. The boyfriend is the one whose passport is expired. The author has been reminding him, so maybe she's tried to be proactive. But does that make her responsible if he still doesn't act? The key point is whether the author has a duty to continue supporting him in this matter or if it's his responsibility. Since a passport is personal and requires individual action, the boyfriend should be the one to handle it. \n\nHowever, considering the financial aspect: they paid $1000 each for the trip. If the author goes alone, he loses his money, but she might not have to deal with the stress. But is it fair to expect her to wait or help him? She's tried to get him to renew it, but he didn't. So maybe she's not in the wrong for not helping now. Also, the dynamic where he's been juvenile and she feels like a mother\u2014this might indicate that he's not taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other through issues. But in this case, the issue is his own inaction. The author has done her part by reminding him, and now if he doesn't act, it's on him. So the author isn't in the wrong for not helping further. Therefore, answer B.\n"
