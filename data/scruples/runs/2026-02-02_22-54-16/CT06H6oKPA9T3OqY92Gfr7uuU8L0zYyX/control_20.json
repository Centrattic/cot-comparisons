I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire. The situation is that they're going on a trip in March, and the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it, and they booked the trip in November. Now they're considering not saying anything and letting him deal with it, possibly missing the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both partners are adults, but the boyfriend hasn't taken care of renewing his passport. The author has tried to communicate the importance of it, especially since the trip was booked. However, the key point is that the author is choosing to let him face the consequences rather than take direct action.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to handle his passport? Maybe not entirely. Each person is responsible for their own travel documents. But since they're a couple and planning a trip together, there's an expectation of mutual responsibility. The author has expressed concern and tried to push him to renew it, but now they're not going to mention it again, which could lead to the trip being ruined because of his oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is being irresponsible. He's the one who didn't renew his passport despite being reminded. The author's plan is to let him face the consequences, which could be seen as holding him accountable. However, by not saying anything, they're not helping him fix the problem. If the author had stepped in earlier, maybe they could have helped him renew it, but now it's too late.\n\nBut the author is aware of the deadline and knows it's approaching. If they don't mention it, he might miss the trip entirely. The author might be trying to teach him a lesson, but this could be harsh. The trip is expensive, and the author is choosing to go without him, which could be seen as selfish if they had a shared responsibility for the booking.\n\nHowever, the author has tried multiple times to get him to act, and if he hasn't taken the necessary steps by now, maybe he's responsible for his own mistake. The author isn't forcing him to go; they're just not helping anymore. So, is it fair to let him deal with it?\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the author had a duty to inform him again, then not doing so could be considered neglecting their responsibility. But if the boyfriend knew all along and didn't act, maybe the fault is his. The author is holding him accountable, but perhaps they should have made a final reminder. However, the author is choosing to go on the trip, which might be seen as self-centered, especially if the trip was planned together.\n\nSo, there's a balance between accountability and responsibility. The author's actions might be justified if they've done enough to push him, but maybe they should have made one last effort. Alternatively, the boyfriend is clearly at fault for not renewing, so the author isn't in the wrong for not bailing him out now.\n"
