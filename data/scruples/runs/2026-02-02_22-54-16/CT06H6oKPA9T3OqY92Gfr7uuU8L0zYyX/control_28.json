It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire, leading to him missing their trip. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The user says she brought it up several times and even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which is about 4 months before the trip in March. The deadline to get the passport renewed in time is approaching, and the author's plan is to let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't act now.\n\nSo, the key points here: the boyfriend had a long time to renew his passport. The author repeatedly reminded him and even had conflicts. She's now taking a hands-off approach because he's been irresponsible. The trip is expensive, and she's considering going without him if he doesn't handle it. \n\nDoes the author have a responsibility to remind him again? She has, but maybe not in a way that's proactive enough. But given that he's been neglectful, is it fair to hold him accountable? The user is in a dynamic where she feels like a parent to him, which might explain her frustration. However, letting him face the consequences could be seen as abandoning him, especially since the trip is already paid for. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not the one whose passport is expired. She's given him chances, and he didn't act. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that as a partner, she has a duty to keep pushing until it's done, even if it's his responsibility. \n\nThe question is whether she's an asshole for not helping. If she's given up because he's been irresponsible, it's understandable. But if she's being passive-aggressive or not supporting him enough, maybe. The answer hinges on whether the responsibility lies with her to continue pushing even when he's not listening. \n\nGiven that she's already tried and he's not acted, maybe she's justified. But there's a nuance here. If she could have helped more, maybe she should have. However, with the info given, she's done her part. So answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
