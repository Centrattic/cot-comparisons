I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire and then planning to go on the trip without him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching for renewing the passport. The author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences, hence going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the passport issue has been ongoing for a long time. The author has warned and tried to address it. The boyfriend didn't take action despite the warnings. The author is now facing the choice of letting him take responsibility for his inaction.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the author can't be held responsible for the boyfriend's failure to renew his passport. They tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. The decision to not help now might be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. However, there's a potential issue of fairness\u2014if the author had the means to help (like assisting in the process or covering costs), but it's not mentioned here. The boyfriend's own responsibility to renew his passport is his, not the author's. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the trip was paid for by both. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend might lose his share of the payment, but that's his consequence. The author isn't forcing the trip; they just aren't helping him meet his own responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the author feels like a parent, which might indicate an imbalance. But that's separate from the passport issue's responsibility. The author's decision here might be a way to enforce boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because they've done their part to communicate and warn. The boyfriend's inaction is his own fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
