I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and her boyfriend are planning a trip in March, but his passport has been expired since 2018. She's mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it, and they've already paid a lot for the trip. Now she's considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get his passport renewed on time, meaning she'd go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has tried to communicate the issue repeatedly. The boyfriend hasn't taken action despite knowing the consequences. The author is facing a financial loss if the trip is canceled, but she's also considering walking away from the plans. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the boyfriend has the responsibility to get his passport updated. The author has done her part by reminding him. However, by not intervening, she's letting him face the consequences. But since they've already spent money, maybe she has a duty to try to salvage the situation, like helping him get the passport done, even if it's last minute. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is being irresponsible, maybe the author isn't wrong for not wanting to take responsibility for his actions. But maybe she's being a bit harsh by not offering further help. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for letting him miss out. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did she do enough to address the problem? 2) Is it fair for her to take action when the responsibility is on him? \n\nSince she brought it up multiple times, even had arguments, she's done her part. If he still didn't act, then he's at fault. The author isn't forcing him to go; he's the one who didn't prepare. So, by not helping him anymore, she's not necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that relationships involve compromise, and maybe she should have stepped in more. But given the context, she might be justified in her decision. \n\nSo the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe she should have helped him renew the passport herself, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not saying anything. Since she's taken the initiative and he didn't act, she's not at fault. Therefore, B.\n"
