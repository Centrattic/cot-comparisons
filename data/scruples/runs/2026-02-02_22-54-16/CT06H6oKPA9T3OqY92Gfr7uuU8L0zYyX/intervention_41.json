I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they booked together. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since 2018, and they've mentioned it several times, even had arguments. The trip was booked and paid for in November, and the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not helping anymore and going alone if the boyfriend doesn't act.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, right? Even if the author has brought it up multiple times, the actual responsibility for renewing it lies with him. The author's role here is more of a concerned partner trying to help, but if they've done that and the boyfriend hasn't taken action, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nThe tiff or two over it suggests that the boyfriend wasn't taking it seriously. The author has made their concerns known, but the boyfriend might have been ignoring them. The author's plan is to stop helping and let the boyfriend face the consequences. That seems like a way to hold him accountable for his own actions. \n\nNow, considering the cost. The trip cost $1000 each. If the author paid for both, but the boyfriend didn't renew, the author might have to take responsibility for their own part, but the boyfriend's part is his own. However, if they split the costs, the author might feel like they're losing money too. But the main issue is the passport being his responsibility.\n\nIs the author being a jerk by not helping anymore? Well, they've tried multiple times. The boyfriend's inaction is his own doing. The author isn't forcing him to renew it; they've just given him the heads-up. So if the boyfriend doesn't act, it's his fault. The author might be justified in not wanting to be responsible for his mistakes. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe they should have enforced it more strictly, like setting a firm deadline or helping him renew it even if he didn't want to. But the story says the author is not going to say anything and let him deal with it. That could be seen as passive aggression. But if the boyfriend was aware and didn't take action, perhaps the author's hands are tied. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not continuing to try to make the boyfriend act. Since the boyfriend is the one who let it expire and the author has already made the effort, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure that the author isn't being negligent in their part. They mentioned the deadline is approaching, so they've been proactive. Letting the boyfriend face the consequences might be a lesson, even if it's harsh. The answer is B.\n"
