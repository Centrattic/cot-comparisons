I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. She's been nagging him about renewing it for a while, even had arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip. She's planning to go alone if he doesn't get it done.\n\nHmm. Well, first, the responsibility of getting a passport is on the individual. But since they're a couple traveling together, maybe there's some shared responsibility? However, the boyfriend has been neglecting it despite being reminded. The author tried to get him to act but he didn't. Now she's choosing not to push further and let him face the consequences. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, she did try to communicate. If she had forced the issue or maybe taken more direct action, like helping him renew it or threatening to cancel the trip earlier, that might be different. But she's giving him the final chance and if he messes up, she's going. It's possible that she's holding him accountable for his own actions. Since the passport is his responsibility, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might say she should have been more proactive in ensuring he dealt with it. But given that she's tried multiple times and he didn't act, maybe it's his fault. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
