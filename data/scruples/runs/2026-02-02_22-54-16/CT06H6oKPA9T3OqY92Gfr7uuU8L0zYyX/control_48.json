I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they paid for. The author's reasoning is that the boyfriend has been neglecting to renew his passport despite multiple reminders and even arguments. The trip was booked in November, and the deadline is approaching. The author wants to know if it's wrong to not help anymore and let him face the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's responsibility: he should have taken care of his passport, but the author kept reminding him. If he's been ignoring the issue despite being told, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. On the other hand, the author is paying for the trip (1000$ each) and might have expected a partnership in handling the logistics. \n\nIn a relationship, especially when planning something like a trip, communication and shared responsibility are key. The author brought it up several times and even had conflicts, which shows they tried to address the problem. The boyfriend's juvenile behavior and the mother-child dynamic suggest that he might not be taking the necessary steps independently. \n\nHowever, leaving someone to face the consequences could be seen as a form of punishment. The author is choosing not to intervene further, which might be reasonable if the boyfriend hasn't acted on the warnings. But is it fair to make him miss the trip without any final effort to help? Like, maybe the author could have reminded him one last time or made a joint call to the embassy. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: each paid 1000$, so the author is out of pocket if he can't go. But if the trip was a shared decision and the author knew the deadline, maybe they should have set up a system to track it. The boyfriend is responsible for his own documents, so if he failed, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nBut the fact that the author is going on the trip alone might not be the issue. The question is about being wrong for letting it happen. The boyfriend's responsibility is his own, but in a relationship, there's often an expectation of support. So if the author had offered help and he ignored it, she's not the asshole. However, if she never actually helped him with the renewal process or didn't ensure he was on track, maybe she shares some blame. \n\nThe key points here are repeated communication, the boyfriend's inaction, and the author's decision to not help further. If the author has done her part, then she's not in the wrong. But if she could have helped more, she might be. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the boyfriend is primarily responsible for his own passport. The author's intention is to let him face the consequences for his own neglect, which could be justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
