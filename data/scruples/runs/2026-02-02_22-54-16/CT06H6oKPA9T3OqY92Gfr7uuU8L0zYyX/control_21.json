      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up several times. They even had arguments about it. The trip is booked for March, and now the deadline to get the passport renewed is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with it, potentially missing the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. Let's break down the key points. The boyfriend's passport was expired for a long time, and the author has tried to address it. They even had disagreements. The trip was booked in November, which means they had time to plan. The author is now considering not helping him anymore and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get his act together.\n\nThe author's intention is to let him face the consequences. But is that being an asshole? Well, maybe. The problem is that the trip is a shared plan. Even if the boyfriend is responsible for his passport, the author is also part of the relationship and part of the planning. If she's aware that the passport is expired and he's not taking action, is it her responsibility to push him further? Or is she within her rights to let him take responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is clearly at fault for not renewing his passport. The author has tried to make him aware multiple times. So maybe she's not entirely wrong. On the other hand, the trip is a joint commitment. If they both paid for it, then letting him miss it without any discussion could be seen as leaving him to face the financial loss alone. Also, the author is choosing to go on the trip without him, which might be harsh, but maybe justified if he's been neglecting his responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic she mentions\u2014feeling like a mother and child. Maybe this is part of a pattern where she's always taking a caretaker role. However, in this specific case, the passport issue is critical, and her decision to let him deal with the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable. But if she's not communicating anymore, that might not be helpful. Maybe she should have enforced a consequence earlier, like not booking the trip until he sorted it, but she did book it, so now it's paid for.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: if they both paid for the trip, she's letting him lose money. That could be seen as harsh. However, if he's the one who didn't take action despite her reminders, then maybe it's his own fault. The key here is whether she's being selfish or holding him accountable. The question is whether she's an asshole. If she's standing up for herself and making him take responsibility, maybe not. But if she's using this as a punishment due to the mother-child dynamic she mentioned, that might be more about her emotions than the situation itself.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, and she's holding him accountable. However, some might argue that she should have done more to ensure he got it renewed, but given that she tried multiple times and had conflicts, she might be within her rights to let him face the consequences now. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
