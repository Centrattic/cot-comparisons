I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The boyfriend's passport expired in May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which is expensive (around $1000 each). The deadline to renew is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is at fault. The boyfriend clearly had the responsibility to renew his passport well in advance. The author mentioned bringing it up several times, so they did their part to communicate. The boyfriend didn't act on it despite knowing the consequences. The trip was booked in November, which gives ample time, but the boyfriend didn't take action. The author is choosing to prioritize their own plans now that the deadline is near. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who failed to renew the passport. They tried to remind and even had conflicts about it. The boyfriend's inaction led to the problem. The author's decision to go on the trip without him, while it might seem harsh, is a choice based on the boyfriend's failure to meet his responsibilities. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have stepped in to help renew the passport despite the deadlines. But the problem is that the responsibility for a passport is typically on the individual. The author isn't obligated to do that unless they agreed otherwise. Also, the author's response is a consequence of the boyfriend's neglect, which could be seen as a way to hold him accountable.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend didn't take action despite multiple warnings. The author did their part by reminding him. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
