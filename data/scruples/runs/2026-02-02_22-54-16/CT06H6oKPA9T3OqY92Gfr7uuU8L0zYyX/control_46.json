I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they paid for. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, which is a long time. The author has mentioned it several times and even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for a $1000 each trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting him handle it if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nHmm. The key points here: Did the author take responsibility for the passport renewal? The boyfriend is the one whose passport is expired, and the author has pointed it out multiple times. If the boyfriend hasn't acted despite clear warnings, maybe the author isn't at fault. But since they're a couple, should the author have taken more initiative to ensure both passports were up-to-date?\n\nAlso, the user mentions the boyfriend can be juvenile and the relationship feels like a mother-child dynamic. The author might be reacting to that by not wanting to take on more responsibility. But is it fair to punish him by not mentioning it now? If the author didn't set a clear deadline or follow up closer to the trip, maybe they share some blame. But if they've been vocal and he ignored it, then maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: The trip was booked in November. At that time, the passport was already expired. Did the author book it knowing his passport was expired? If so, maybe they didn't consider the possible consequences. But if the author thought he would renew it, then the fault is on him for not doing so.\n\nThe author's intention is to let him deal with the consequences, which could mean he can't go. It's a $1000 trip, so the financial loss is significant. But if the boyfriend was the one who neglected to renew, the author isn't responsible for that. However, relationships often require compromise and support. The author might be using this as a way to enforce accountability, but it's a harsh consequence.\n\nI think the main question is whether the author is at fault for not ensuring the passport was renewed. Since the responsibility lies with the individual to renew their own passport, even though the author reminded him, the boyfriend's inaction is his own. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not stepping in further once they've already brought it up. But maybe they should have reminded him again as the deadline approached. However, given the boyfriend's history of ignoring it, the author's decision to let him face the consequences could be justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B for No.\n"
