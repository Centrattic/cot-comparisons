I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, and now she's considering not saying anything so he can deal with the consequences if his passport isn't renewed in time. She wants to go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend has been neglecting his passport renewal for a long time, despite being reminded. That's on him. He's responsible for his own documents, and if he didn't act on the warnings, he's at fault. The author tried to inform him, which she did by bringing it up several times. She even had conflicts about it, which shows she took it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the relationship dynamics mentioned a mother-child dynamic, where she feels like the mother. That might imply that she's taken on a caretaker role, which could mean she has a responsibility to ensure he's prepared. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not intervening further. If she knew the deadline was approaching and he hadn't acted, by not reminding him again, is she responsible?\n\nLegally, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. So, the boyfriend is the one who didn't renew his passport. The author can't be held responsible for that. But in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual support. However, if she's already done her part by reminding him and he didn't act, maybe she isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe cost is also a factor. The trip was paid for by both, so if he can't go, maybe there's a financial loss. But if she's going alone, she might be using his mistake to her advantage, which could be seen as unfair. But again, he's the one who didn't take action. \n\nEmotionally, if she feels like she's been nagging him and he hasn't listened, maybe she's justified in not wanting to confront him further. However, by not intervening, she's allowing him to face the consequences. But is that being cruel or is it holding him accountable? \n\nI think the key here is that she did her part by reminding him multiple times. The final responsibility lies with him. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not stepping in again, especially if she's tired of the dynamic. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so maybe she should have pushed harder. But given the information, she's already done what she could. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
