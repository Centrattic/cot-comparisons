I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a trip planned for March, and the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author mentioned they've brought it up several times and even had arguments about it. The deadline to renew is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything else, letting the boyfriend handle it, and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it done in time. The cost is significant, around $1000 each, which they've already paid.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are responsibility, communication, and fairness. The author has been reminding the boyfriend multiple times about the passport. That shows they've tried to communicate and help. The boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn't taken action despite the warnings. The author is now choosing not to intervene further, which might be a way to hold the boyfriend accountable for his own responsibilities. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing this? Well, the author isn't forcing the situation; they're giving the boyfriend the chance to take responsibility. If he messes it up, he alone is responsible for missing the trip. The author is not preventing him from acting, just not stepping in anymore. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could be more proactive, like helping him renew the passport themselves, but the author hasn't done that. But given the history of the boyfriend not responding to reminders and the fact that the author has already tried, maybe it's reasonable for the author to step back. \n\nAlso, the cost is a big factor here. If the trip is expensive and the boyfriend messes it up, the author might lose money, but the author is willing to accept that. The key here is whether the author is being fair in not taking further action. Since they've given enough warnings, it's the boyfriend's responsibility to act. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They've done their part by communicating, and the final responsibility lies with the boyfriend. Therefore, the answer would be B for No.\n"
