I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now they've booked the trip and paid $1000 each. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time, so she can go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend's responsibility: having an expired passport since 2018 is on him. He's responsible for his own travel documents. The author has tried to remind him, maybe even pushed him. But she's also the one who booked the trip after November. Did she make sure he had his passport ready before booking? If she knew the deadline was approaching and he hadn't acted, maybe she should have intervened earlier. However, she's now choosing to let him take the consequences, which could leave him stranded or missing out.\n\nThe financial aspect: $1000 each is a significant amount. She might be protecting her own money by not canceling the trip if he's not ready. But if she cancels because he's not getting the passport, she might lose the money. If she goes alone, she spends hers, but he loses his. That's a factor.\n\nThe dynamic mentioned is that he's juvenile and she feels like a mother. Maybe she's taken on the role of managing his responsibilities, which could be unhealthy. But is it fair for her to cut him off now? She might be holding him accountable, which is good, but in a way that might leave him in a bad spot. \n\nAlso, considering the timing: the deadline is approaching quickly. If she had intervened earlier, maybe she could have helped more. But now, she's decided not to. Is that being passive-aggressive? Letting him face the consequences is a form of accountability, but if she's already made the decision without trying to resolve it, maybe she's avoiding conflict. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about intent and fairness. If she's aware he's responsible but hasn't done it despite warnings, maybe she's justified in not helping further. However, if she's aware he's struggling and not offering support, that could be considered harsh. Since he's the one who didn't act on his responsibilities, she's not directly at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for not helping. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The boyfriend's responsibility; 2) The author's attempts to remind him; 3) The financial impact on both; 4) The decision to let him face consequences. So the author is not in the wrong because the responsibility lies with the boyfriend. However, if she had the means to help him renew the passport (like financially or logistically) and didn't, that might be different. But in this case, it seems like she's chosen to step back after multiple reminders. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
