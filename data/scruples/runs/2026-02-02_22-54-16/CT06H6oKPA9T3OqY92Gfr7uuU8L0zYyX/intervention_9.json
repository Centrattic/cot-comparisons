It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and their boyfriend are planning a trip in March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times, even leading to arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The deadline for the passport renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend is being irresponsible, and they feel like a parent in the relationship. They want to let him deal with the consequences. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has tried to communicate the importance of renewing the passport, the boyfriend hasn't acted, the author is taking a proactive stance by not interfering further, and the financial loss is shared. \n\nNow, considering responsibility in relationships. Both partners should be responsible for their own travel documents. The author has done their part by reminding the boyfriend, but the passport is his responsibility. If he didn't act, then the consequence is his own. However, sometimes in relationships, people might help each other out, especially with shared plans. But the author is not forcing the issue; they're choosing to let him face the consequences. \n\nIs it fair to hold someone responsible for their own documents? Yes. So the author isn't wrong for not stepping in. But some might argue that since it's a joint trip, the author should have ensured he got his passport done. However, the boyfriend's own actions (or inactions) led to the problem. The author might be protecting themselves from further conflict or financial loss.\n\nAnother angle: the cost of the trip is split. The author is losing $1000 if they go alone. But that's their own responsibility for booking without ensuring his passport was renewed. The boyfriend is equally at fault for not acting on his end. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because they've made their concerns known and the boyfriend didn't follow through. The author's decision to let him face the consequences is a valid choice, especially if the boyfriend has shown a pattern of irresponsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has done their part to communicate, and the boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) are his own responsibility. The author is not obligated to save him from his own mistakes, especially when it's a shared financial burden and the boyfriend hasn't acted despite multiple warnings.\n"
