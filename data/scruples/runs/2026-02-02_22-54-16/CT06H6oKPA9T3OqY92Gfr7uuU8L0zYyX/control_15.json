I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The main points are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, the author has brought it up multiple times, they had a tiff, and they booked the trip in November. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend handle the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author did bring up the passport issue several times. That shows they tried to address it. The boyfriend didn't act on it, even after arguments, which suggests he's responsible for his own inaction. The author's plan is to let him deal with the consequences. But is that being an asshole?\n\nI think it's important to consider both sides. The author isn't the one who expired the passport; that's the boyfriend's responsibility. The author tried to get him to renew it, but he didn't. Now, the author is facing a decision: either cover for him (maybe financially or logistically) or let him face the repercussions. If the author doesn't intervene, he might miss the trip, but the author isn't directly causing the problem; they just aren't helping anymore. \n\nHowever, some might argue that since they are in a relationship and made plans together, the author has a responsibility to ensure both can attend. But the boyfriend's repeated negligence and the author's attempts to resolve it could shift the blame. The author isn't the one who failed to renew the passport, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is that the author tried to address the issue multiple times, and the boyfriend didn't take action. So the author isn't necessarily at fault for not helping further.\n"
