      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018. She's brought it up multiple times, they even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline is approaching for him to renew the passport in time. Now, she's considering just letting him deal with the consequences and going on the trip alone. She's asking if she's an a**hole for doing that.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend had a long time to renew his passport, and the author repeatedly reminded him. The cost of the trip is significant, and it's their joint responsibility. But she's taking a hands-off approach now, which might leave him stranded. \n\nOn one hand, it's his responsibility to have valid documents. The author did her part by reminding him. If he didn't act, maybe he's the one at fault. On the other hand, being in a relationship often involves supporting each other. By not helping him now, she's letting the consequences hit him, but maybe that's the right lesson.\n\nBut wait, the trip was booked together. If she goes alone, she's abandoning him, but maybe she feels justified because he didn't take responsibility. However, relationships require some level of teamwork. If she had stepped in earlier or reminded him more persistently, maybe they could have avoided this. But she says she brought it up several times and even had tiffs. So she did her part.\n\nAnother angle: She's using this as a lesson, but at the cost of his $1000 and potential travel issues. Is that fair? It might be harsh, but if he's responsible, maybe he should have taken action. Also, the dynamic she mentions (feeling like a mother figure) suggests some imbalance, but that's more about the relationship than the immediate issue.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she did all she could and he still didn't act, maybe not. But if she could have helped more, like assisting in the renewal process or setting up a reminder, maybe yes. But the post says she brought it up several times, which implies she tried. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's letting him take responsibility for his actions, even if it's painful.\n"
