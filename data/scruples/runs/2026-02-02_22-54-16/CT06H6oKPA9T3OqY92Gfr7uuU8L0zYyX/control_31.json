I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The scenario involves a couple going on a trip, and the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author mentions they've brought it up several times, even had arguments, and now the deadline is approaching. The author plans to go on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport renewed in time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. Both partners are going on a trip together, so both are responsible for ensuring their documents are in order. However, the boyfriend hasn't taken action despite repeated reminders. The author has tried to communicate the importance of the passport renewal, even to the point of conflict. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared responsibility. The author has made their concerns known multiple times. The boyfriend's inaction is a problem, but the author is now considering letting him face the consequences. The question is whether the author is at fault for not stepping in further.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they've done their part by reminding him. On the other, maybe they should have taken a more proactive role, like helping him renew the passport or even going with him to get it done. The cost of the trip is also a factor\u2014$1000 each is significant, so both would lose out if the trip is canceled. \n\nBut the author's intention to let him deal with it alone could be seen as holding him accountable for his own responsibility. However, in a relationship, sometimes partners help each other with such matters. The dynamic mentioned (feeling like a mother and child) might indicate that the author has been taking on a caretaker role, which could be part of the issue. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily wrong if they've made their expectations clear and the other person didn't act. But if there's a shared responsibility in planning a trip, both should contribute. However, the boyfriend's negligence is the main problem here. The author's decision to not intervene further might be seen as justified if they've exhausted all communication attempts and the other person isn't responding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong if they've made their position clear and the boyfriend didn't take action. The responsibility is on both, but the boyfriend's inaction is the key issue here.\n"
