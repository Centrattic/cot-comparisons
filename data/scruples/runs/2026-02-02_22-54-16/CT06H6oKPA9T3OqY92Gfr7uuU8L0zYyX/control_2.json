I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The scenario is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for a trip to another country in March. The deadline for sending the passport is approaching, and the author plans to not say anything and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time. They want to go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are communication, responsibility, and the nature of their relationship. The author has clearly mentioned the passport issue multiple times, including arguments. The boyfriend didn't act on it despite being reminded. The author is now considering not helping further and letting the boyfriend face the consequences. \n\nIs the author wrong for not helping anymore? Well, in a relationship, especially planning a trip, both partners should share responsibilities. However, the boyfriend hasn't taken action despite being given multiple chances. The author might feel they've done their part by bringing it up. On the other hand, some might argue that the author has a responsibility to ensure both parties can travel, especially since it's a joint trip they've planned and paid for. \n\nBut the author mentions the boyfriend can be juvenile and they have a mother-child dynamic, which suggests the author might have taken on more responsibility than the boyfriend. If the boyfriend is neglecting his duties, the author might feel justified in not taking the blame for his inaction. Also, the author is being honest about their intention to let him handle it, which could be seen as holding him accountable. \n\nHowever, from another angle, even if the boyfriend is at fault, the author might still be expected to support the trip as a couple. Letting him miss the trip could be seen as cutting him off rather than finding a solution. But given the history of arguments and the boyfriend's inaction, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author has done enough to ensure the passport is renewed. Since they've brought it up multiple times and the boyfriend didn't act, the responsibility shifts. The author might not be in the wrong for not helping further, especially if they feel the boyfriend isn't contributing his part. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
