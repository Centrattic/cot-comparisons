I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip they've already booked and paid for. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. Now, with the trip in March and the deadline approaching, the author is considering not reminding him and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author has tried to bring up the issue multiple times and even had conflicts. That shows they've made an effort to address the problem. The boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn't taken action despite being aware. The author is now thinking about not intervening further, which could lead to him missing the trip. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author is obligated to remind or force their partner to renew his passport. Since the passport is his responsibility, and the author has already made their concerns known, maybe it's his fault for not acting. However, in a relationship, partners often support each other with logistics, so perhaps the author should have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew it or even doing it for him if necessary. But the author says they brought it up several times and even had tiffs. So maybe they did their part. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a factor. The trip cost $1000 each, which is a significant amount. The author might be frustrated that they're paying for a trip that the boyfriend can't attend due to his own negligence. The question is, is it fair for the author to let him face the consequences? If the boyfriend had the opportunity to renew his passport and didn't, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nBut then, sometimes in relationships, you have to take responsibility for each other's actions, especially when planning something important like an international trip. The author might be seen as selfish if they just leave him hanging without any support. However, the boyfriend's juvenile behavior and the author's feeling of a parent-child dynamic suggest that the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for himself. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they did their part by repeatedly bringing it up. If the boyfriend ignored those reminders, the onus is on him. The author has the right to prioritize their own plans and not be held responsible for his inaction. So the answer should be B.\n"
