I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which cost $1000 each. Now the deadline is near, and the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend face the consequences.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend's passport issue has been a long-standing problem. The author has tried to address it repeatedly, so maybe the boyfriend is at fault for not taking action. The author's plan is to let the boyfriend deal with it now, which could mean he misses the trip. \n\nBut wait, is the author responsible for the boyfriend's passport? Typically, each adult is responsible for their own travel documents. The author might have reminded him, but the actual responsibility lies with the individual. So if the boyfriend didn't act on the warnings, maybe the author isn't in the wrong by not stepping in further. \n\nHowever, relationships often involve support. Even if the boyfriend is responsible, the author might feel a duty to help. But the author has already tried and the boyfriend hasn't acted. The author is now choosing to let the consequences happen. \n\nAnother angle: the financial aspect. The trip cost a lot, and if the boyfriend misses it, the author might lose the money. But the author is willing to go alone, which could be seen as holding them accountable. \n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned\u2014feeling like a mother and child\u2014suggests the author might feel the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, which adds to their decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend neglected his own responsibility despite being warned, the author might be justified in not helping further. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author could have done more, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author isn't at fault for not intervening now.\n"
