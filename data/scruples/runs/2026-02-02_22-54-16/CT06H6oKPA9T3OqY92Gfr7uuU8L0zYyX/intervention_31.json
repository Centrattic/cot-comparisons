I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The author is considering not helping him get his passport renewed on time and going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried to bring it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which is a few months before the deadline. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is thinking about not helping him anymore to let him face the consequences.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend didn't renew his passport despite being reminded multiple times. The author tried to address the issue early on, which shows she was proactive. However, she might have expected him to take responsibility. The question is whether it's fair for her to leave him behind now that the problem is his fault.\n\nI should consider if there's any shared responsibility. Maybe the author could have followed up more or set stricter deadlines. But given that they had arguments and he still didn't act, she might be within her rights to not help further. Also, the cost of the trip is significant, and if she cancels, she might lose the money. Choosing to go without him could be a practical decision to avoid financial loss and the stress of last-minute issues.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a partner, she should support him, even if it's his fault. But the original poster mentions the dynamic feels like mother and child, which suggests she's been taking care of him. Maybe she's tired of that role and wants to set boundaries.\n\nSo, balancing responsibility and fairness, it's likely the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend didn't act on his responsibilities despite multiple warnings. Her decision to let him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
