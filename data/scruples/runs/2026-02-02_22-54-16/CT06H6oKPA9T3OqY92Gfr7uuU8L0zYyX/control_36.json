I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. She paid $1000 each for the trip, and now she's planning not to say anything, so he deals with the consequences, and she goes alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has tried to get him to renew his passport multiple times, even had fights. That shows she's made her concerns clear. The boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn't acted on those warnings. He's responsible for his own passport, so maybe she's not at fault here. \n\nBut then again, in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual support. Even if it's his responsibility, maybe she should have pushed harder? But she did mention it several times. The question is whether her inaction is reasonable. She's not forcing him to go; she's just not helping further. If he didn't act on her previous warnings, is it his fault now?\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they paid for the trip together. If he can't go, she might lose money, but she's choosing to go alone. That could be seen as selfish, but if he's at fault, maybe she's justified. \n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer. The key points are: she made her concerns clear, he didn't act, and she's not forcing him. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other through issues. However, the boyfriend's inaction despite multiple warnings is on him. \n\nSo the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
