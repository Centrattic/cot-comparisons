I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, the trip is booked, and the deadline for renewing the passport is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences, meaning he might miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should be accountable for their own documents, especially something as crucial as a passport. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. The author has already tried to bring it up, which shows they care. However, the author is also being passive-aggressive by not giving a final warning. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is punishing the boyfriend by not helping him, even though they had a joint responsibility to plan the trip. If the author doesn't mention the deadline again, it's possible the boyfriend might not act in time. But the author already knows the consequences, so by not saying anything, they're letting the boyfriend face the natural outcome of his inaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might be, because even though the boyfriend is responsible, the author could be seen as not supporting him enough. However, since the author has already tried to address the issue multiple times, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are: mutual responsibility vs. individual accountability. The author tried to communicate, but maybe didn't push hard enough. Alternatively, the boyfriend is an adult and should have taken initiative. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author has done their part by bringing it up, and if he doesn't act, it's his own fault. However, some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other, so not giving a final warning could be seen as passive-aggressive. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author isn't actively causing the problem but letting the existing issue play out, maybe they are not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
