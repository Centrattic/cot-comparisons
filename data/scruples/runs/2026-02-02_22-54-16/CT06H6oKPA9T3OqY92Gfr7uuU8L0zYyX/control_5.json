I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They had a trip booked in March, which they paid for in November. Now the deadline is approaching, and she's considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibility here. The boyfriend was aware of the passport issue and didn't take action despite being reminded. The author has tried multiple times to get him to renew it. She even mentions they had arguments about it. The trip was booked together, so both are equally responsible for their documents. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is being unfair by not helping him now. If the boyfriend didn't act on the warnings, maybe the author isn't at fault. She paid for the trip, but it's a joint expense. However, if she's choosing to go without him, she's prioritizing her own plans over his mistake. But since the passport renewals are individual responsibilities, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so maybe she should have pushed harder. But she did bring it up multiple times, and he didn't act. The question is whether her inaction now is justifiable. Legally and logically, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. So if he failed to renew, the consequence is on him. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
