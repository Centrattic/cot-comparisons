I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their boyfriend renew his expired passport before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried to remind him multiple times, even leading to arguments. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author's plan is to let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it done in time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both partners are adults, so each is responsible for their own documents. However, the author mentions they've brought it up several times, suggesting they've tried to communicate. The boyfriend's lack of action is a personal responsibility. But is the author wrong for not stepping in more? \n\nThe author's intention is to let him handle it, which could result in him missing the trip. The user wants to know if this makes them an asshole. The key factors are whether the author had a duty to intervene further or if the boyfriend is solely responsible. Since the author has already communicated the issue and the boyfriend didn't act, the author isn't in the wrong. They can't be held responsible for his inaction. Plus, the trip is booked in both names, but the author can't force him to renew his passport. So, the answer would lean towards B (No).\n"
