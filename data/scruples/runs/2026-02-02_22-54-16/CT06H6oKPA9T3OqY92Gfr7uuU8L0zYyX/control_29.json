It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport since 2018, and they've had multiple discussions about it. They even had some arguments. They booked a trip in November, which is expensive. Now, the deadline for him to renew his passport is coming up, and the author is considering not mentioning it and letting him deal with the consequences, possibly making him miss the trip.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility, communication, and fairness. The author has brought up the passport issue several times, indicating they've tried to address it. The boyfriend's juvenile behavior might contribute to why he hasn't acted. The author is now at a point where they're deciding not to intervene further, which could lead to a financial loss and an empty trip for them.\n\nI need to consider if the author is at fault. The boyfriend is primarily responsible for his own passport, but the author has a stake in the trip and the money spent. By not reminding him now, is the author being negligent? Or is it the boyfriend's responsibility from the start? Also, the author's intention is to let him face the consequences, which could be seen as a lesson for not taking responsibility. However, the author would be left alone on the trip, which isn't ideal.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author make sure the boyfriend knew the stakes? If they've already mentioned it multiple times, maybe they have done their part. The boyfriend's inaction despite warnings could make him at fault. The author's response is to let him face the natural consequences, which might be justified if they've done their part.\n\nBut is it fair to withhold the last warning? If the author doesn't mention the deadline now, the boyfriend might miss the trip due to his own negligence. The author isn't causing the problem directly but is not intervening. It's a bit of a gray area. Depending on cultural norms, some might see the author as justified in holding the boyfriend accountable, while others might think they should give one more reminder to cover all bases.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user wants a simple A or B. Considering the boyfriend's repeated neglect and the author's prior attempts, the author might not be in the wrong. So B (No) could be the answer. However, if the author's action of not reminding him is seen as a failure in their relationship responsibility, then A (Yes). It's tricky, but leaning towards B because the responsibility lies with the boyfriend, and the author has tried multiple times already.\n"
