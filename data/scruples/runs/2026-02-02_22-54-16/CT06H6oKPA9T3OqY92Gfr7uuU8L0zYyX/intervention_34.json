I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport go unaddressed, leading to a potential trip cancellation. The author has brought up the passport issue multiple times, even had arguments about it, and now they're considering letting their boyfriend face the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, so that's a long time. The author has tried to address it several times, which suggests they've made efforts to resolve the issue. They even mention booking a trip that's non-refundable, costing $1000 each. The key point here is that the responsibility for the passport renewal lies with the boyfriend, but the author has done their part by reminding him multiple times.\n\nThe author's intention is to not intervene anymore and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences. The question is whether this makes them the asshole. From a fairness standpoint, if someone repeatedly ignores or fails to act on important responsibilities, the other person might feel justified in stepping back. However, sometimes in relationships, one person takes on more responsibility to prevent both from suffering. \n\nIn this case, the author has tried to communicate and even had conflicts over it. If the boyfriend didn't take the necessary steps despite being warned, the author might not be at fault. But there's also the aspect of the trip being a joint plan. If the author goes on the trip without him, it might affect their relationship, but if the boyfriend is at fault for not acting, the author isn't necessarily the asshole. \n\nAnother angle: the cost is a factor. The author paid $1000 each, so letting the boyfriend miss out might mean they lose the money. However, the author might feel they've done enough and can't be held responsible for the boyfriend's negligence. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author has fulfilled their responsibility in the situation. They have, so they're not in the wrong. The boyfriend's inaction is his own fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
