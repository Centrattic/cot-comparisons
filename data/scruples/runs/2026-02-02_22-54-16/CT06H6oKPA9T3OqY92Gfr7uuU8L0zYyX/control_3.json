      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's been in a relationship for over a year. Her boyfriend's passport expired in May 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They had arguments about it. After booking the trip in November, the deadline for renewing his passport is approaching. She's decided to let him handle it and possibly miss the trip, while she goes alone.\n\nI need to consider if she's responsible for his passport. Generally, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. Even in a relationship, it's each person's own responsibility. She's mentioned she's brought it up several times, so maybe she's done her part. But the problem is that they booked the trip together, so maybe there's an expectation that both would handle their own passports. However, if he's been neglecting it for a long time and she's made it clear, perhaps she's not at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since they're a couple, she should have taken more proactive steps to ensure he renewed it, like helping him with the process or following up more closely. But the key point is that the boyfriend is the one who didn't act on his responsibility. She's not legally obligated to handle his passport. Her decision to let him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. \n\nHowever, others might think that in a committed relationship, partners support each other's responsibilities. If she's been nagging him and he's ignored it, she's done her part. The blame lies with him for not taking action despite being warned. So, she's not in the wrong for not intervening further. \n\nAlso, considering the financial aspect\u2014each paid $1000. If he misses the trip, he loses his money, but she's within her rights to go if her passport is valid. The question is about moral responsibility. \n\nIn summary, while some might see her as callous for going alone, legally and ethically, the responsibility for one's own travel documents is personal. She's not in the wrong if she's made her concerns known and he didn't act. So the answer is B.\n"
