      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend whose passport expired, and the author didn't push him to renew it in time for their trip. The author is considering letting him deal with the consequences, even if that means he can't go on the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. The deadline is approaching, and the author is thinking of not helping and just going alone.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The answer should be A or B.\n\nSo, factors to consider: Did the author do enough to ensure the passport was renewed? The author mentions bringing it up several times and having tiffs. That suggests they tried. However, not being actively involved in the renewal process might be a problem. The boyfriend is an adult, so ultimately, he's responsible for his own documents. But in a relationship, there's often shared responsibility, especially for a trip they both booked.\n\nThe author is now considering cutting off support, which could lead to the boyfriend missing the trip. Is this fair? Maybe the author should have intervened more, like helping him apply or setting a reminder together. But the author might feel that the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, which is why they're letting him deal with it.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and responsibility. The author tried to bring it up, but the boyfriend didn't act. However, the trip is a joint expense, so the author might be at fault for not ensuring both passports were valid before booking. On the other hand, the boyfriend's inaction led to the problem, so the author might not be in the wrong for not pushing further.\n\nI think the key is whether the author had a duty to ensure the passport was renewed. Since the author has a history of bringing it up but not following through, maybe they're not in the wrong. The boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own passport. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But some might argue that in a relationship planning a trip together, both should ensure travel documents are in order. However, the author did try to communicate, so maybe B is correct.\n"
