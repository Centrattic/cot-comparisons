I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport be an issue for their trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're supposed to travel in March. His passport expired in 2018, which is a long time. She's mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline for getting his passport renewed is approaching, and she's considering not helping and just going alone.\n\nSo, the key points here. She's responsible for her own passport, right? Typically, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. She's been reminding him, but maybe she's overstepping? Or maybe she's being reasonable. \n\nBut the problem is, she's choosing to leave him to deal with the consequences. If he doesn't renew it in time, he can't go. She's not helping anymore. But is that being an asshole? Or is she justified because he didn't take responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, it's his responsibility to have his passport. She can't force him to renew it. If she's been nagging him and he ignored it, maybe she's right to not take the blame. On the other hand, maybe she should have intervened more, like helping him renew it or going with him to the office. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong by not doing that now.\n\nAlso, their relationship dynamics: she mentions he's juvenile and she feels like a mother. Maybe that's a sign of codependency or her taking on too much responsibility. But in this case, she's finally deciding to not take the blame. \n\nThe financial aspect: they both paid, so if he can't go, she loses her money and he does too. But she's taking the trip anyway. Is it fair? Well, if he's at fault for not renewing, maybe she's not wrong to proceed. \n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's not responsible for his passport. Even though she tried to remind him, the final responsibility is his. If she's given enough warnings and he didn't act, she's justified in not helping further.\n"
