I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, the trip is booked for March, and the deadline to renew the passport is approaching. The author is considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it done, and she'll go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend had the responsibility to renew his passport, but the author kept reminding him. However, since the passport has been expired for a long time, maybe she should have been more proactive in helping him with the process. But the main issue is that he didn't act despite being warned. \n\nNow, the author is thinking of not reminding him anymore and letting him face the consequences. The question is whether this makes her an asshole. If she's already taken steps to let him know the importance (bringing it up multiple times, even arguments), then maybe she's done her part. On the other hand, if she's aware that not renewing the passport will ruin the trip and she doesn't help, maybe she's being selfish by not giving him a final push. \n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. The user might think that since the boyfriend failed to act, the author isn't at fault for not stepping in further. The key points here are shared responsibility and whether the author has fulfilled her part. If the author tried repeatedly and the boyfriend didn't follow through, then the responsibility is on him. The author's decision to not intervene further might be seen as holding him accountable for his inaction. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The trip cost $1000 each, so the author might feel she's losing out too. If she goes alone, she might lose money, but the question is about morality, not just financial loss. If the boyfriend isn't ready, maybe she's in the right to protect her own interests. \n\nHowever, there's a dynamic where she feels like a mother to him. That might imply that she's used to taking care of things for him, but in this case, she's choosing not to. It's a bit of a gray area. If she's been nagging and he still didn't act, then letting him face the consequences could be seen as fair. Alternatively, if she's supposed to help him through the process, not just remind him, that's a different scenario. \n\nI think the key is whether the author did everything she could to help him renew the passport. If she just reminded him and he didn't act, then she's not at fault. If she didn't offer help or support when needed, maybe she is. But according to the scenario, she brought it up several times, so it's possible she did her part. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
