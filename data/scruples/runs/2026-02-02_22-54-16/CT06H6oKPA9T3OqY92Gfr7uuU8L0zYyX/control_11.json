I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The key points here are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, she's mentioned it several times, they had arguments about it, and they paid for a trip. The deadline is approaching, and she's planning to go on her own if he doesn't fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she's at fault. She tried to bring up the passport issue multiple times and even had conflicts. She might feel frustrated, especially if he's irresponsible. However, letting him miss the trip on purpose could be seen as a punishment. Is she being fair?\n\nShe did book the trip in November, and presumably, they both agreed to it. If he's neglecting his responsibility, maybe she's justified in stepping back. But on the other hand, she could have given him more support or intervened earlier. By waiting until the last minute to act, she might be putting the financial loss and emotional stress on him. Also, the money was paid by both, so she's letting him bear the full cost of his mistake, which might not be fair.\n\nBut considering the dynamic she describes\u2014feeling like a mother to him and him being juvenile\u2014maybe she's had enough. However, is it right to punish him by not helping at all? There's a balance between holding someone accountable and being supportive in a relationship. If she's in a position to help him get the passport, but chooses not to, that's different than if she tried and he refused. Since she's not going to intervene, she's letting the consequences happen, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, the cost is $1000 each, so she's losing her money either way. But she's choosing not to go with him, which might not be fair if she's the one who's responsible for ensuring he has the necessary documents. Maybe she should have taken more active steps earlier, like helping him renew the passport. If she knew about the problem for a long time and didn't take action until now, maybe she's partly at fault.\n\nBut wait, she said she brought it up several times. Maybe she did her part in communication. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to step in more actively. If she's aware of his irresponsibility, perhaps she should have taken a more proactive role, like helping him apply or setting up reminders. Just bringing it up and having arguments might not be enough. \n\nSo, if she knew he was likely to forget and didn't take steps to ensure he renewed it, she might share some responsibility. But if he's being willfully negligent, maybe she's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she gave him every chance to fix his mistake or if she's now punishing him. Since she's aware of the problem, had multiple chances to address it, and now is choosing not to help, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, if she's done her part and he still didn't act, maybe not. The fact that she's not going to say anything and let him deal with the consequences is a passive-aggressive move. Maybe the right approach would have been to confront him one last time or offer to help him get the passport. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't take active steps to resolve the issue once she knew he wasn't acting responsibly. Instead, she's letting him face the consequences without support, which could be seen as unfair. However, if she tried everything and he still didn't act, then maybe B. But based on the information given, she brought it up and had tiffs but didn't explicitly say she helped him get it renewed. So she might be in the wrong for not following through more directly.\n"
