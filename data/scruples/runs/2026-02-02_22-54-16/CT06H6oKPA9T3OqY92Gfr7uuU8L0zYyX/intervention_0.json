It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend's expired passport and the author's decision to go on the trip alone if he doesn't get it sorted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, which is a long time. The author has mentioned it several times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline is approaching for the passport to be sent off to get it in time. The author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend handle it, even if he misses the trip. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. However, the author has tried multiple times to get him to renew it. The fact that they've had tiffs over it shows they've discussed it enough. The author might feel that since the boyfriend didn't take action despite warnings, the responsibility is on him now. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so the author should help him get the passport renewed even if he's being negligent. But the author is taking a step back, not out of malice but because the boyfriend hasn't acted. The author is not being cruel; they're setting a boundary. \n\nThe cost is a factor too. Losing $1000 each is a consequence, but if the boyfriend didn't act on the warnings, maybe it's his fault. The author isn't trying to hurt him but is respecting his choices. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport. The author has done her part by reminding him multiple times. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable. However, the trip is a shared plan, and by going alone, the author might be seen as abandoning the commitment. But the user's perspective is that the boyfriend's inaction is the problem.\n\nThe key points are responsibility, communication, and consequences. The author isn't forcing the situation but is allowing the natural outcome. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents, and the author has done her part.\n"
