We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she was extremely into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa, and her response to a hypothetical scenario about him being in the hospital. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. They've been dating for over a month. The main issue here is the girlfriend's fangirling to an extreme degree. She's not just a fan but is saving for a tattoo and attending a concert. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert if he was in the hospital. The author found this response heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's reaction is justified. On one hand, if someone is in a committed relationship and is more devoted to a celebrity to the point of neglecting their partner in a hypothetical critical situation, that's a red flag. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting because it's a hypothetical scenario, but it's also about the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to be understanding initially. The girlfriend's response was a dealbreaker for him. Relationships are about compatibility, and if one person's commitment to a celebrity causes emotional distress, it's a valid reason to end things. However, some might argue that the author didn't address the issue earlier or that a hypothetical shouldn't end a relationship.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the hypothetical revealed a significant incompatibility. If the girlfriend truly was more committed to the celebrity than her partner in a crisis, the relationship wasn't sustainable. The author had the right to prioritize his emotional well-being.\n"
