We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey've been dating seriously for over a month. The girl loves K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The guy is okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But when he asked if she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, she said yes without hesitation. The guy then called her a psycho and broke up. So, the question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the guy's actions: He set up a hypothetical where he's seriously sick and asked if she'd still go. Her answer was a firm yes. He took that as a sign she doesn't value their relationship over her K-Pop obsession. But maybe the question was leading her, or he was testing her. Was it fair to ask such a hypothetical? Maybe he was trying to see where her priorities lay. Her response hurt him, so he ended the relationship.\n\nBut let's consider their relationship's maturity. They're both 18, so young. He's been with her for a month, and this is a serious issue for him. However, maybe the problem is more about his own insecurities or jealousy. He mentions she's not very complimentary towards him, but when she talks about the K-Pop idol, she's super enthusiastic. That could create a sense of imbalance, making him feel neglected. Her tattoo and saving money for a concert might also be stress points.\n\nHowever, the key moment is the hypothetical question. It's a bit of a loaded question. If he's seriously sick, her commitment to the idol over her partner could be a red flag. But is it fair to end the relationship based on one hypothetical answer? Maybe the guy overreacted. But he felt heartbroken, so perhaps it's justified for him. The question is whether he was in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, her answer was honest, and if he couldn't accept that, maybe he shouldn't have asked. On the other hand, if her dedication to a stranger (the idol) is more than her commitment to him, that's a problem. The guy's reaction was extreme (calling her psycho), but given his feelings, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the question was a reasonable test. But maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier instead of using a hypothetical. However, in the context of a relationship, if one's partner is more committed to someone else, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. So, maybe the guy isn't in the wrong. But some might say he overreacted. It's a tough call. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I'm leaning towards B (No), but I have to consider if the question was fair. Alternatively, maybe he should have discussed his feelings before breaking up. But given the situation, his actions might be his way of handling the hurt.\n"
