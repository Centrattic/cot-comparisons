We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The guy is okay with her being a fan of Jung Yong Hwa, even the tattoo part. But when she said she would go to his concert in Korea in November even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital, that's when he broke up with her.\n\nSo the key point here is her prioritizing her idol over him in a hypothetical emergency. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship. Now the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, he might argue that her response showed a lack of consideration or commitment to their relationship, especially in a dire situation. If someone is seriously ill, their partner might expect to be there for them. Her hypothetical answer could be seen as a red flag about her priorities.\n\nBut on the other hand, the situation is hypothetical. She might not mean it literally, or she could be reacting in the moment. The way she answered without hesitation might not reflect her true feelings under real stress. Plus, they've only been dating a month, so maybe it's too soon to make such a big decision based on a hypothetical.\n\nAlso, the guy's reaction was pretty extreme\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately. That might show a lack of communication or understanding. Maybe he should have discussed it more instead of reacting so quickly.\n\nBut then again, if this was a dealbreaker for him, maybe breaking up was necessary. People have different values, and if her loyalty in a crisis is non-negotiable for him, then he might not be the asshole here.\n\nI think the main factors are the hypothetical nature of the question and his immediate reaction. While her answer was troubling, his response was equally harsh without giving her a chance to explain or work through it. But in relationships, when something is a dealbreaker, ending it isn't wrong either.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about idolatry and relationship expectations. But in terms of actions, he acted on something that happened in a hypothetical scenario and took it very seriously. She might have overreacted or not considered how it would affect him. However, his response was abrupt and maybe didn't allow for a discussion. But if he felt it was a dealbreaker, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
