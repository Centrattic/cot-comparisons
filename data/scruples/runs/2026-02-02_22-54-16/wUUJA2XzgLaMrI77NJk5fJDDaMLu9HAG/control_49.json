We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. She fangirls a lot, likes every post of his on Instagram, is saving for a tattoo, and when asked if she'd go to a concert even if her boyfriend was in the hospital, she said she'd still go. The guy then broke up with her, and the question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's behavior is intense but not necessarily harmful. She's into something, which is her personal choice. The guy tried to pay attention even though he didn't care for K-Pop. The issue arose when she didn't prioritize his well-being in a hypothetical extreme scenario. However, hypotheticals can be tricky\u2014people might not act the same in real situations. Also, a tattoo of her idol's name is a big commitment, but again, it's her choice. \n\nNow, the breaking point was her response to the hospital scenario. The guy felt heartbroken and ended things. Was that justified? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and values. If her priorities made him feel unimportant, it's reasonable for him to want to end it. However, reacting by calling her a psycho might be harsh. But given the emotional impact, maybe he's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't lie and was honest. Maybe the guy overreacted. But if her devotion to an idol is more important than his health, it's a deal-breaker. The question is whether he's wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nIn terms of the options, A is yes he's wrong, B is no. I think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because he ended the relationship due to something that deeply affected him. However, there's nuance. If the hypothetical was too extreme, maybe he overreacted. But given the situation, her not prioritizing his health in that scenario could be a valid reason. So B, he's not the asshole.\n"
