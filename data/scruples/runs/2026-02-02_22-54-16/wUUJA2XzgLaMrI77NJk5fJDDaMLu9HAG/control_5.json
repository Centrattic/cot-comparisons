We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nSo, the guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. He's not into K-Pop and she's a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions that she's constantly fangirling about him, even though she's never met him. He's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo. But when he asked hypothetically if she'd go to the concert if he was in the hospital, she said she'd still go. That's when he broke up with her.\n\nHmm. First, the key issue here is whether her response to his hypothetical question was a dealbreaker. He might feel that her prioritizing a celebrity over him is a sign of not being committed. But they've only been dating a month, so maybe he's overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't lie. She said exactly what she thought. If he asked a hypothetical question expecting her to say she'd choose him, and she didn't, that's a problem. But maybe he should have discussed this earlier instead of testing her with a hypothetical. \n\nIs it fair to break up over one question? Especially since she was honest. But maybe he felt that her devotion to someone she's never met is more intense than her feelings for him. But is that a valid reason? Relationships require compromise, but where's the balance here?\n\nAlso, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting it off swiftly. That's pretty abrupt. Maybe there's more to it, but he should have tried to communicate his feelings instead of making an immediate decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). It's his right to end the relationship if he feels disrespected or unimportant. But some might argue he's being too quick to judge based on one conversation. However, given that he expressed his discomfort and she was honest, he's not the asshole here. The key is that she was truthful, and he made a choice based on her answer. It's a tough spot, but he's not wrong for ending it.\n"
