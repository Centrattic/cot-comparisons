We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The guy is okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo, but her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital made him break up. She said she wouldn't lie if he was in the hospital and she still wanted to go to the concert.\n\nThe key point here is the response to the hypothetical question. The guy asked, \"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\" She replied that she wouldn't lie and would still go. He found that heartbroken and ended the relationship. The user is saying the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nI need to consider the context. The girlfriend's behavior up to that point was fangirling, which the guy tolerated. He even said he was okay with the tattoo. The breaking point was her response to the hypothetical question. The question is whether her answer was a deal-breaker or if the guy overreacted.\n\nIn relationships, expectations matter. The guy might have expected her to prioritize their relationship over her fandom. However, the scenario is hypothetical and extreme. The girlfriend might not have realized how much this would hurt him. But the fact that she was completely serious and didn't back down could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, ending a relationship over a hypothetical situation might be harsh. He could have discussed his feelings with her instead of breaking up immediately. But given the seriousness of the hypothetical (a life-threatening situation), her response might indicate a deeper issue about her priorities. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I should consider if the guy's reaction is justified. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario might seem extreme, but if it revealed a fundamental mismatch in values or priorities, it's understandable. Alternatively, maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier rather than waiting for this incident.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks for the person who acted without considering the other's feelings. If the guy didn't express his concerns before this incident, he might have been in the wrong. But if this was a culmination of his feelings, then maybe not. The key is whether her answer was a valid reason to break up. Since she was completely serious and he felt heartbroken, perhaps he had a right to end it. However, the situation is complicated. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the hypothetical scenario revealed a deal-breaker for him, and he chose to end the relationship rather than stay in something that made him feel undervalued. However, there's a chance others might argue he was too quick to judge. But based on the given info, B seems correct.\n"
