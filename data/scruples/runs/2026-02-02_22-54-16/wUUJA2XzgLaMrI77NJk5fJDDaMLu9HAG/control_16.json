We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. She's a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point where she fangirls a lot, saves money for a tattoo, and likes all his posts on Instagram. The breaking point was when he asked, hypothetically, if she'd still go to his concert in Korea even if he (the author) was in the hospital. She didn't lie and said she would go, which made him break up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction is justified. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior and the author's response. The girlfriend's obsession with K-Pop is described as extreme, but the author says he's okay with most of it, including the tattoo. The main issue was her response to the hypothetical question about his hospitalization. She was honest, but her answer seemed to prioritize her fandom over their relationship. The author felt heartbroken and called her a \"psycho,\" which is a strong term. \n\nNow, considering the timeline: a month-long relationship. It's possible that during a short time, compatibility issues can arise. The question is whether her answer was a dealbreaker. The author's reaction was to break up immediately, which might be seen as impulsive. On the other hand, if her prioritizing her fandom over him, even in a hypothetical scenario, made him feel insecure or unvalued, that's a valid concern. \n\nBut the author's main issue was her response to the hypothetical situation where he's in the hospital. If she was serious about that, it might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. However, it's important to note that she never met the artist, so it's possible her fandom is more about the music or admiration from afar. The author's calling her a psycho and ending the relationship suddenly could be seen as harsh, especially since he had time to consider the tattoo part and was okay with it. The immediate breakup after one statement might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author played along with the hypothetical scenarios, so maybe he was testing her. If she was honest in her answer, even if it stung, the author's response was to end things. The fact that he was surprised by her seriousness could mean he didn't address the issue earlier. The tattoo part was something he was okay with, so maybe the concert decision was a bigger issue. However, breaking up over this in a month-long relationship is debatable. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: if the girlfriend's answer was a red flag he hadn't considered before, but his reaction was extreme and abrupt without deeper discussion, he might be the asshole. On the other hand, if her answer indeed showed a lack of prioritization of their relationship, then he's justified. But since he was okay with the tattoo, maybe the concert wasn't a bigger issue. The key is the suddenness and the accusation of being a psycho. That's pretty harsh. So, probably the author is in the wrong (A). But some might argue that the girlfriend's answer was disrespectful (B). \n\nHowever, relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author didn't confront her about her fandom before, so when he did, she answered honestly. His response was to end the relationship immediately. That's a strong move, so maybe he's the asshole for overreacting. Alternatively, her answer showed she wouldn't prioritize him in a critical situation. But the situation is hypothetical. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because he didn't handle it maturely. He should have discussed his feelings instead of reacting impulsively. Calling her a psycho is an insult, and breaking up over a hypothetical scenario without addressing the underlying issue is harsh. The girlfriend's answer might be a red flag, but the author's reaction is what makes him the asshole here. So, the answer is A.\n"
