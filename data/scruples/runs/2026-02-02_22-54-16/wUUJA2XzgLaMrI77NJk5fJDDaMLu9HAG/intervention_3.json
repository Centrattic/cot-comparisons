We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of saving for a tattoo and attending a concert in Korea. The author mentions he's okay with most of this, but when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, she said she wouldn't lie and would still go. That's when he broke up with her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't like the way she responded to his hypothetical scenario. He felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. One person's level of fandom might be another's red flag. The girlfriend's behavior seems extreme to the author. However, the author's reaction was to break up after a hypothetical question. Was that too quick? Did he give her a chance to explain or discuss the issue? \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response indicated she values her fandom more than the relationship in that hypothetical. But it's a hypothetical, and maybe she didn't mean it literally. However, the author took it as a serious indication of her priorities.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed his concerns earlier instead of letting it build up. But given that they were only dating for a month, maybe he felt this was a deal-breaker. Breaking up over a hypothetical is drastic, but if it's about core values (like commitment vs. fandom), it's a valid reason for some people.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was immediate and harsh. Calling someone a psycho and ending the relationship over a single exchange might be seen as impulsive. Perhaps there was a lack of understanding or dialogue before the breakup. However, if the author felt that her response confirmed his fears about their incompatibility, then he might not be the asshole.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If he had discussed his feelings about her fandom before, this might have been a culmination of issues. But since it's the first time he's addressing it, it's a bit unclear. However, the girlfriend's response to the hypothetical might have been the last straw for the author, making him not the asshole.\n"
