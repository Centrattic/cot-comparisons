We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating for over a month. He mentions that he's tried to be understanding of her K-Pop fandom, even though he doesn't like the genre. He says she's overly fangirling about Jung Yong Hwa, talking about how talented and sexy he is. He's okay with her liking every post on Instagram, saving for a tattoo, etc. But then she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital. That's when he breaks up with her.\n\nFirst thought: Is it fair for him to break up over this? Well, the key here is the context. He was okay with her being a fan before. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert despite his serious illness. The question is whether her response was unreasonable or if he overreacted.\n\nHe says he was playing along with hypothetical scenarios, and when he asked what if he was in the hospital, she said she didn't care. He was shocked and called her a psycho, ending the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the relationship length is over a month. Sometimes in new relationships, people might prioritize their hobbies or interests more, but when it comes to commitment, especially in a serious relationship, expecting support during a partner's illness is understandable. However, she didn't lie; she was honest. Maybe he felt that her commitment wasn't there, but did he have the right to end things so quickly?\n\nBut then again, maybe he didn't handle it well. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario might be a bit extreme. However, if this was a recurring issue where she was constantly putting the idol above him, it could be a red flag. The problem here is that he's using a hypothetical scenario to test her, and her response made him feel that her priorities were misplaced. \n\nBut is it fair to break up over that? If he had discussed his feelings about her fandom earlier, maybe they could have found a middle ground. Instead, he waited until this moment to confront her. Also, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho\u2014is not constructive. However, the fact that she was completely serious and didn't hedge her answer might have made him realize that her devotion to the idol was more important than her relationship with him.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He might feel justified in ending the relationship if he felt disrespected or less prioritized. On the other hand, breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario without addressing it constructively could be seen as impulsive. \n\nBut considering that he was the one who asked the question and then reacted strongly, maybe he's not entirely wrong. Relationships require communication, and if he had concerns earlier, he should have addressed them. However, her response to the hypothetical shows that her loyalty might not be where he expected it to be. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. It's possible that her behavior was a deal-breaker for him, but the way he handled it could be criticized. However, the answer depends on whether prioritizing the idol over a partner's health is acceptable. Since she didn't lie and was honest, he might have valid reasons to feel hurt. But in terms of being in the wrong, perhaps not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if he felt her actions were a deal-breaker.\n"
