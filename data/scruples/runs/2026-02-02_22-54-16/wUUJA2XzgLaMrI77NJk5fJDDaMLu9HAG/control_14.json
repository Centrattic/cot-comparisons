We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the guy and his girlfriend have been dating seriously for over a month. He doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot. He says she's complimentary to the artist in a way that's over the top compared to how she treats him. She likes every post on Instagram, is saving for a tattoo, and says nothing would stop her from going to his concert in Korea even if he (the author) was in the hospital. He took that as a deal-breaker and broke up with her. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for a month, which is a short time. The breaking point was her statement about not going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. Her commitment to her fandom versus her commitment to the relationship. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable or not, and if his reaction was justified.\n\nThe girl's behavior seems obsessive. Liking every post, planning a tattoo, and prioritizing going to a concert over her boyfriend's health. That's a red flag for commitment in a relationship. If a partner was in the hospital, not being there would be a major issue. The guy felt betrayed and heartbroken, leading him to break up. \n\nBut some might argue that he overreacted. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings first instead of ending things. However, given her apparent lack of consideration for his feelings in that moment, he might have felt it was the only option. The question is if he's wrong for doing so.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and commitment are crucial. If one partner's interests are taking precedence over the other's well-being, that's a problem. The girlfriend's response shows she might not value the relationship as much as her fandom, which is a deal-breaker for the author. So, he's not in the wrong for ending it over that. Answer B.\n"
