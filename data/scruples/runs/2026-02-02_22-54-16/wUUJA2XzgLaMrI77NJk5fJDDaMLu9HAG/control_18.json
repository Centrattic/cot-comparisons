We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. So, the guy broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom, specifically her admiration for Jung Yong Hwa. He says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo, but her response to a hypothetical question about him being in the hospital pushed him over the edge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is into K-Pop, which she's passionate about. He's tried to be supportive, but the issue here seems to be about loyalty and commitment. The guy asked a hypothetical where he's in the hospital, and she said she'd still go to the concert. He took that as her not caring about him, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he was wrong. Let's see. Hypotheticals can be tricky. Sometimes people ask them to test reactions, but in a real relationship, that might not be the healthiest approach. The guy's reaction was pretty extreme\u2014he called her a psycho and ended things. But was the hypothetical a reasonable way to test her feelings?\n\nOn one hand, if someone truly cared about their partner, they might prioritize their well-being over a concert. But the girlfriend's answer was honest, and maybe she didn't see the hypothetical as serious. However, the question itself was a bit manipulative. Asking \"what if I was in the hospital\" to test commitment might not be fair, especially if it's a hypothetical scenario that's not real.\n\nBut the guy's reaction to her honest answer was immediate and harsh. Breaking up over a hypothetical that isn't an actual situation might be overreacting. Also, relationships require compromise and understanding. If the guy was uncomfortable with her fandom, maybe he should have addressed it earlier rather than using a hypothetical to force a confrontation.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions (tattoo, saving for a concert) show deep commitment to her interest. But the guy's feelings matter too. If her fangirling made him feel insecure or neglected, he should have communicated that. However, ending the relationship in the heat of the moment without discussing it further could be seen as impulsive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy might not be in the wrong because his feelings were hurt, and he had a breaking point. But using a hypothetical to test her might not be the best approach. However, the way he ended it\u2014calling her a psycho\u2014could be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's honest answer wasn't manipulative, so she might not be at fault either.\n\nConsidering that, the guy's reaction was extreme, but given the context, maybe he's not entirely wrong. It's a tough call. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA), the answer might be B (No), because he had valid feelings and couldn't handle the situation, even if his method was harsh. Alternatively, maybe he's not entirely right, but not the sole wrongdoer. Hmm.\n"
