We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. She's fangirling a lot, which the author finds a bit bothersome but tries to be understanding. He mentions that she's not very complimentary towards him, but when talking about the artist, she's overly enthusiastic. She likes all his posts, is saving money for a tattoo, and wants to go to his concert in Korea. The author is okay with all that except for her response when he asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd go regardless of his situation. The author breaks up with her because of this.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had been tolerating her K-Pop fandom. The breaking point was her response about the concert if he was in the hospital. The question is whether the author was wrong to break up.\n\nFactors to consider: The author's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity rather than any concrete issue. She's not cheating or being unfaithful; she's just a fan. The author's problem is with her prioritizing the K-Pop idol over him in a hypothetical scenario. But this is a hypothetical, and her response was honest, which the author took as a betrayal. \n\nHowever, in a new relationship, especially one a month old, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario where the partner would prioritize a celebrity over them (even if hypothetical) might be seen as the author overreacting. The girlfriend's response was honest but not necessarily a deal-breaker. The author could have discussed his feelings instead of reacting impulsively. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that this level of fandom was affecting their relationship or his self-esteem, he should have addressed it earlier. But in this case, he waited until the hypothetical question to act. The fact that he called her a psycho and cut off the relationship immediately suggests a lack of communication and understanding. \n\nSo, the answer here leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because he reacted impulsively to a hypothetical, which might not be a valid reason to end a relationship. His actions could be seen as immature and not addressing the real issues. However, there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) if the hypothetical was a deal-breaker for him. But given the context, the consensus is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
