We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fangirling, especially after she said she wouldn't go to a concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy isn't a fan of K-Pop but tries to be attentive. The girl is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, liking every Instagram post, saving for a tattoo, and talking about going to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go even if he was sick. The guy felt heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The girl's behavior seems excessive. Constant fangirling about someone she hasn't met, saving up for a tattoo, and being absolutely committed to attending a concert regardless of her partner's health. That seems like a major red flag. The guy's reaction is immediate and harsh, but maybe his feelings were hurt because it felt like he wasn't important to her. \n\nBut was it right for him to break up so quickly? He did confront her about it in a hypothetical scenario, and her answer was non-negotiable. The tattoo and the concert plans might indicate a deeper issue of prioritizing a celebrity over their relationship. The guy might feel that her devotion to the idol is a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his reaction was too quick. Maybe he should have discussed it more or tried to understand her perspective first. But given that it was a hypothetical situation and her response was so absolute, he might have felt it was a deal-breaker. \n\nI think the key here is whether her behavior is acceptable. If she's treating a celebrity as more important than her partner, that's problematic. The author's reaction, while abrupt, might be justified if he felt her loyalty was misplaced. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
