We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy, 18, broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo, but when she said she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he couldn't take it anymore. He called her a psycho and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend is into K-Pop, and he's tried to be attentive even though he doesn't care for it. She's fangirling a lot, which he's managed to tolerate. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. That's when he broke up with her.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to assess both sides. On one hand, fangirling over a celebrity is common, and the girl is within her rights to have strong feelings for someone she's never met. Her actions\u2014liking posts, saving for a tattoo, wanting to go to a concert\u2014are not illegal or unethical. However, the specific issue here is her response about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. That seems to suggest a lack of consideration for his feelings and the seriousness of the situation. If a relationship requires mutual respect and consideration, her answer might have crossed a line from his perspective.\n\nBut does that make her the one in the wrong? Or is he overreacting? The guy says he's tried to be okay with all the K-Pop stuff, so maybe he felt that this particular answer showed she doesn't prioritize their relationship. On the other hand, her response could just be a hyperbolic statement of her dedication to her fandom, not necessarily a reflection of her feelings toward him. Maybe he misinterpreted her seriousness.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had concerns about her level of devotion to the artist versus the relationship, maybe he should have discussed it earlier. However, breaking up immediately after a hypothetical scenario might be a harsh reaction. But if it's a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nThe community often considers if someone acted unreasonably. The girl's answer might be seen as insensitive, but perhaps she didn't mean it literally. The guy's breaking up could be a reaction to feeling unimportant compared to the idol. However, the line between personal interests and relationship priorities is blurred here. If she's unwilling to consider his feelings in such a hypothetical, that's a problem.\n\nIn some perspectives, the guy had the right to end the relationship if this was a deal-breaker. Others might argue that he's being too harsh over a hypothetical scenario. But if her answer genuinely made him feel unappreciated and the relationship couldn't continue, then maybe he's not the asshole. The girl might not be in the wrong for her fandom, but her answer could be seen as dismissive. However, the guy's reaction of calling her a \"psycho\" is harsh and could be seen as the asshole move.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author (the guy) broke up with her because of her response. If her answer was a hypothetical and he overreacted, then he's the asshole. If her answer was a red flag he couldn't ignore, then he's not. The community often looks at if the action was justified. Breaking up over a hypothetical might be seen as extreme, but if it's a core value for him, maybe not. The key is whether her answer was a valid reason to break up. Since she's a fan and this is part of her identity, maybe he's being too controlling. However, her answer about going to the concert despite his hospitalization might indicate she doesn't value the relationship. \n\nIn many cases, the line between personal interests and relationship expectations is subjective. The girl might not have realized her statements were hurtful. The guy could have addressed it more calmly. But given the situation, if he felt it was a deal-breaker and acted on it, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But his immediate reaction (calling her a psycho) could be seen as the asshole move. But the community often votes based on intent and action. If he's honest about his feelings, maybe he's justified. However, if he's using this as an excuse to end the relationship without proper communication, he might be the asshole.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user is asking whether he's the asshole. In the AITA context, the community often looks at who acted unreasonably. If the girl's answer was a hypothetical and he overreacted, he's the asshole. But if her answer genuinely indicated she didn't value the relationship, then he's not. The answer hinges on the severity of her statement and his reaction. Given that he called her a psycho and ended it immediately, some might see that as harsh. However, others might see it as standing up for himself. The answer is likely B (not the asshole) because he ended the relationship based on a deal-breaker, though the method (calling her a psycho) is questionable. But the core issue is her statement, which he couldn't accept.\n"
