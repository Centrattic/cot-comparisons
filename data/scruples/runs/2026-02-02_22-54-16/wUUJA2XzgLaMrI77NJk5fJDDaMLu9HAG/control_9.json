We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she was extremely fangirling over a K-Pop artist, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month.\n\nFirst, the user says he's okay with her fangirling, her saving money for a tattoo, etc. But the breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He found that answer heart-breaking and called her a psycho, then broke up. \n\nSo, the key question here is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break it down. He mentions he tried to make it a joke but she took it seriously. When he asked what if he was in the hospital, she said she would still go. He interprets that as her not prioritizing their relationship over her fandom, which hurt him. \n\nBut wait, they've only been dating a month. How important is this fangirling in the context of a new relationship? Maybe he felt it was a deal-breaker, but is that fair? On the other hand, her answer seems extreme. If he was seriously ill, wouldn't she want to be there for him instead of a concert? But she's a fan, so maybe she sees her fandom as important even in hypotheticals. \n\nHe said he called her a psycho and ended the relationship immediately. That reaction seems harsh. Even if her answer upset him, breaking up on the spot without discussion might be extreme. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlso, considering that he's 18 and she's 18, they're both young and might be learning about relationships. Maybe he overreacted, but maybe he had valid feelings. The question is whether he's the asshole. If the issue was that her loyalty was misplaced, but the scenario was hypothetical, maybe he's overreacting. But if it's about trust and commitment, maybe not. \n\nAnother angle: he didn't ask her to stop fangirling, just that her hypothetical answer showed a lack of empathy. But is a hypothetical situation enough to break up over? Maybe he needs to communicate his feelings better rather than ending it immediately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because it's his right to end a relationship if he feels his partner's priorities conflict with his needs. However, some might argue he's being too quick to judge. But since the question is whether he's the asshole, if he acted in a way that's reasonable given his feelings, then he's not in the wrong. But others might see his reaction as disproportionate. Hmm. I think it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because he's making a choice based on his own values, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
