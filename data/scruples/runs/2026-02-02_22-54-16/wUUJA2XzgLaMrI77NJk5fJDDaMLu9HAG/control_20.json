We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom, specifically her devotion to Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly, liking every post, and saving for a tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if her boyfriend was in the hospital. The author found this response heartbroken and decided to break up.\n\nNow, the key points here are the girlfriend's level of devotion and the author's reaction. The author mentions that he was okay with her liking K-Pop, the tattoo, etc., but the final straw was her not being willing to prioritize him over the concert. The girlfriend's response was that she wouldn't lie, implying she would go to the concert regardless.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's feelings and priorities. The author felt that her devotion was overshadowing their relationship, especially when she didn't prioritize him in a hypothetical serious situation. However, the girlfriend's response was honest about her feelings, which might have been shocking but not necessarily wrong from her perspective. \n\nBreaking up over this could be seen as a reaction to a deal-breaker for the author. If he felt that her level of devotion was a fundamental issue that he couldn't accept, then leaving might be his right. However, some might argue that the hypothetical scenario is extreme and not a realistic measure of her commitment. Also, considering they've only been dating a month, maybe it's too soon for such a final decision. \n\nBut the author tried to play along with the hypothetical, and her honest answer made him realize it was a deal-breaker. In that case, he might not be the asshole because he made his feelings known. However, others might say that her answer was a matter of personal preference and not a reflection of her feelings for him, so he overreacted. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If he felt that her devotion was a deal-breaker, then he's not wrong for breaking up. But if he didn't communicate his feelings before this incident, maybe he's partly at fault. However, given the context, the answer seems to lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he had his reasons and acted on them honestly.\n"
