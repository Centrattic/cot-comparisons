We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession) is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. She talks a lot about him, likes every post on Instagram, and even wants a tattoo of his name. The author is okay with all that until she says she would go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. Then the author dumps her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The main issue is the girlfriend's fangirling versus the author's feelings. The author says he's tried to be understanding but this last comment pushed him over the edge. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nThe girl's response to the hypothetical situation where the author is in the hospital and she still would go to the concert is the breaking point. The author is hurt and calls her a psycho, breaking up. Now, am I supposed to figure out if the author is in the wrong?\n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. If one partner's hobbies or interests are making the other uncomfortable, communication is key. The author tried to tolerate her fangirling but felt disrespected or unappreciated when she didn't consider his hypothetical scenario. However, the hypothetical might be extreme. The girl's commitment to her fandom could be seen as a personal choice, but when it affects the relationship, it's a problem.\n\nThe author's decision to break up is a significant action. Is it fair to end the relationship over one statement? But if that statement revealed deeper issues that had been building up, maybe he wasn't wrong. The girl's response might have shown a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings, which is a valid reason for the breakup. Alternatively, the author might have overreacted or not communicated his feelings earlier.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reaction was proportionate and if he gave her a chance to address the issue before ending things. If he had discussed his concerns earlier and this was a culmination of issues, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he acted impulsively without addressing the problem, maybe he is.\n\nIn the scenario, the author mentions that he had been okay with all her K-Pop stuff before. It was the specific comment about going to the concert despite his hospitalization that was the last straw. That comment might indicate that her devotion to the idol overrides her commitment to the relationship, which is a red flag. The author might feel that his well-being isn't a priority for her, which is a valid concern.\n\nTherefore, the author's reaction, while harsh, could be justified if he felt his emotional needs weren't being met. The key is that the relationship requires mutual respect and consideration. If her actions made him feel unimportant, then ending it is a reasonable choice. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
