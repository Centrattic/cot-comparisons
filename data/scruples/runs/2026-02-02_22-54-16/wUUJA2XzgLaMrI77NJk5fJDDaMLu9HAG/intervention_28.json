We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the K-Pop breakup story is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend because she said she wouldn't go to a concert even if he were in the hospital. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa. She's into K-Pop and admires him a lot, even to the point of getting a tattoo. The author is okay with her being a fan, but when he asked what she'd do if he were in the hospital, she said she'd still go to the concert. That led him to break up.\n\nSo, the key point here is whether the girlfriend's response was unacceptable. The author felt heartbroken and thought she was a psycho. But does her answer justify breaking up?\n\nI should consider relationship expectations. In a serious relationship, especially after a month, partners usually expect some level of commitment and prioritization. The girlfriend's answer suggests that her commitment to her fandom outweighs her commitment to the relationship. However, maybe the author's expectations were too high. Did he communicate his feelings about this before? If he had discussed his insecurities earlier, maybe the situation could have been resolved.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have been testing his hypothetical scenario. But she answered honestly, which he didn't like. The problem is that the author's reaction was immediate and harsh. Breaking up over a hypothetical question might be excessive. But if this was a recurring issue, maybe the author had been building up frustration.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's saving for a tattoo of his name and fangirling constantly might have contributed. The author might feel neglected or insecure. However, in a healthy relationship, communication is key. If he felt this way, he should have addressed it before the breakup.\n\nBut the breaking point was her hypothetical answer. That's the immediate cause. The question is whether her answer is a deal-breaker. If he valued his relationship over her fandom, then maybe he's justified. But others might argue that making a hypothetical about life-threatening illness is too extreme and not a fair test of loyalty.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? It's a tough call. On one hand, breaking up over a hypothetical might be impulsive. On the other hand, if her behavior made him feel unimportant, maybe the breakup was necessary. But if he didn't address the underlying issues before, maybe he's not handling it maturely.\n\nIn the end, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If she was prioritizing a fan obsession over her partner, that's a problem. But the author's reaction could have been more constructive. However, given that he felt heartbroken and couldn't accept her answer, maybe he's justified. But others might say he overreacted. \n\nI think the answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since he was hurt by her response and made a decision based on his feelings. However, maybe he could have handled it better. The key is whether the hypothetical was a fair test. If he was genuinely hurt by her not prioritizing him in a critical situation, then maybe breaking up was his right choice. So, answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
