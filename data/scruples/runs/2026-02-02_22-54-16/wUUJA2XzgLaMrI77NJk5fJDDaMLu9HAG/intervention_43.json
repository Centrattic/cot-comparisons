We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup over the girlfriend's love for a K-Pop artist. The user is 18, and so is his girlfriend. They've been dating for over a month. The main issue seems to be her extreme fangirling, especially over Jung Yong Hwa. She likes him a lot, even though she's never met him, and she's saving up for a tattoo of his name. The user says he's okay with all that.\n\nThe breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie and would go regardless. That's when he broke up with her. Now he's wondering if he was the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: the user had been dealing with her fangirling, which he found a bit much but was trying to tolerate. The final straw was her response to a hypothetical scenario where he's very sick. He expected her to say she'd stay with him, but she didn't. So he broke up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reaction was justified. In a relationship, trust and commitment are important. If one partner is willing to prioritize a celebrity over their partner in a serious situation, that could be seen as a red flag. However, the scenario was hypothetical. Maybe she didn't take it seriously at first. The user made up some situations and was playing along, then asked the hospital question as an obvious mistake. But she took it as a real question and answered honestly. \n\nThe user might feel that her answer showed she doesn't value him as a partner, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the question was a bit extreme. How can you know someone's true feelings in a hypothetical? Plus, they've only been dating for a month. Is it fair to end the relationship over a hypothetical scenario, even if it's about commitment?\n\nAlso, fangirling is a personal hobby. If her fangirling was becoming more important to her than their relationship, that's a problem. But the user says he was okay with the tattoo and her fangirling. The issue was her answer to the hospital question. \n\nSo, the user might feel wronged because he expected her to choose him in a crisis. But she might feel that the question was unfair or out of context. Is breaking up over this too rash? Maybe. But if it's a dealbreaker for him, then he's not in the wrong. The question is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nIn relationships, people have different dealbreakers. If commitment in a crisis is important to him, then her answer might be too much. But since they've only been dating a month, maybe he's overreacting. However, the fact that she was completely serious and didn't back down could be a sign of where her priorities lie. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the hypothetical question was a valid reason to break up. If he felt it was a test of her commitment and she failed, then he's not in the wrong. But if the question was too extreme or not a fair test, then maybe he is. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong because he had a valid concern about her priorities. If she was willing to abandon him in a serious situation for a concert, that's a big issue. So, breaking up over that is understandable. Answer B.\n"
