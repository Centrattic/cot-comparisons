We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her extreme K-Pop fandom, specifically her admiration for Jung Yong Hwa. The key point is when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if her partner was in the hospital. The author broke up with her because she was \"completely serious\" about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girl has been a huge fan, doing things like liking every Instagram post and planning to get a tattoo. The author tried to be understanding but was hurt by her response. The problem is whether breaking up over such a scenario is justified.\n\nK-Pop stans can be intense, but it's common for fans to have strong feelings. However, the line between fandom and real-life relationships is important. The girl's statement that she wouldn't lie implies that she's prioritizing her fandom over the relationship in a critical situation. That could be seen as a deal-breaker for the author, who might feel neglected or replaced by a celebrity.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. The girl didn't say she wouldn't visit him; she just said she'd go to the concert. The author's question was hypothetical, and the response was taken as a sign of commitment not to the relationship. But perhaps the hypothetical scenario was too extreme, and the girl didn't realize the gravity of the situation. Alternatively, maybe the author should have communicated his feelings about her fandom earlier instead of letting it build up to a breaking point.\n\nAnother angle: communication issues. If the author had been feeling neglected, he should have addressed it before the breakup. However, the girl's response might have been the last straw. It's a classic case of differing values. If someone's fandom interferes with their relationship, it's valid for the partner to reassess.\n\nBut considering that the girl was serious about her answer, the author's reaction isn't entirely unfounded. He had the option to talk it through instead of immediately breaking up. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The answer depends on whether the breakup was a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n\nIn many cases, when one partner's interests start to overshadow the relationship, especially in a serious way, it's a sign of potential incompatibility. The author might feel that if his health was a concern and she didn't prioritize that, the relationship wasn't sustainable. Alternatively, he could have been too harsh, given that the scenario was a hypothetical.\n\nI think the key here is the girl's seriousness and the author's reaction. If he was hurt and couldn't reconcile that, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. But the decision to end the relationship based on her response is something that can be justified if he felt it was a deal-breaker. So, maybe the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong, because he had the right to prioritize his needs, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
