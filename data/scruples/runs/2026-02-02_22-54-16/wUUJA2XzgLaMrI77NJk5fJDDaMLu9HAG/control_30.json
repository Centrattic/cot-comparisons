We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her response about attending a concert in Korea even if he were hospitalized.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They've been dating seriously for a month. The girl is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of saving for a tattoo and wanting to go to a concert in Korea. The author isn't against any of that except her recent statement. He asked if she would still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, and she said she'd go, not lying. He took that as a sign that she doesn't care about him in the same way, leading to a breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and expectations in a relationship. The author felt that her response indicated a lack of commitment or priority in their relationship. The girlfriend's actions (fanaticism over a person she hasn't met, possibly spending money on the concert, etc.) might have been a red flag he finally couldn't overlook. However, the author's reaction is immediate and cutting things off without much discussion. \n\nIs he justified? Well, in relationships, compatibility is key. If one partner's interests are causing the other significant distress, it's understandable to seek resolution. But breaking up over one statement might be hasty. However, the girlfriend's response did confirm his fears about her lack of prioritization. \n\nOn the other hand, K-Pop fandoms can be intense, but they're also a common hobby. The author's issue isn't the fandom itself but how it's affecting their relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's answer about going to the concert even if he's in the hospital could be seen as not valuing the relationship enough. \n\nBut was the author wrong to break up? It's a tough call. He might have handled it better with a conversation first, but the breakup itself isn't necessarily wrong if the relationship was already strained. The girlfriend's actions and response might have validated his concerns, making him realize they aren't compatible in the long run. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He made a tough decision based on his values and what he expects in a relationship. The girlfriend's response was a dealbreaker for him, and while he could have handled it more gracefully, the act of breaking up isn't the wrong.\n"
