We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, likes him more than her boyfriend, and even said she'd go to his concert in Korea despite the boyfriend being in the hospital. The author then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether breaking up over this is justified. The girlfriend's behavior includes excessive fangirling, not being complimentary towards her boyfriend, and prioritizing her idol over her partner in a hypothetical scenario. The author felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, then ended the relationship.\n\nOn the author's side, he tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. But did he overreact? Well, when someone says they wouldn't hesitate to leave for their idol even if their partner was in the hospital, that's a big red flag for commitment issues. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If her devotion to her idol is to the point where she wouldn't prioritize her partner's health, that's a serious issue.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to call her a psycho and break up immediately. While her response was problematic, his reaction might have been hasty. Maybe he could have discussed it more calmly. But given the hypothetical scenario, her answer might have shown a lack of empathy and commitment. \n\nThe question is if he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, trust and mutual support are essential. If one partner values an idol more than the other in a critical situation, that's a problem. The author had valid concerns. But the way he ended it could be seen as harsh. However, given the scenario, he might have felt justified. So the answer could be B, he's not in the wrong because her actions indicate deeper issues incompatible with a healthy relationship.\n"
