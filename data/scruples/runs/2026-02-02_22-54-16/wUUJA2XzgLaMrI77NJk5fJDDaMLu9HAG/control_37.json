We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point seems to be her response when he asked if she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie and would still go, which made him break up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for over a month, which isn't super long. The guy says he's okay with her fangirling before, including the tattoo. But her response to that hypothetical question about the hospital is what broke it. \n\nNow, what does her answer imply? If she's serious about going to the concert even if he's seriously ill, that suggests her commitment to her fandom might outweigh her commitment to the relationship. That could be a deal-breaker for him. But is that unreasonable? Maybe she was just being hypothetical, not taking it seriously. Or maybe she is taking it seriously, which shows a lack of empathy or consideration towards his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's reaction was pretty immediate\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up. That's a strong response. Maybe he should have discussed it more before reacting? But if her answer confirmed that she's okay with putting her fandom above their relationship, maybe it's a valid reason to end things. \n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? Well, breaking up over this could be seen as his choice. If he felt that her response showed she wouldn't prioritize their relationship in a crisis, then he's acting on his values. However, maybe he overreacted. Her hypothetical answer might not reflect real-life actions. Also, the tattoo and other things were okay with him before, so the breakup is specifically about the hospital scenario. \n\nIs it fair to break up over a hypothetical? That's a big assumption. Maybe he should have talked to her more about his feelings before ending things. But if he felt it was a deal-breaker, then he's not the asshole for making that decision. \n\nAlternatively, maybe her answer wasn't a big deal. People often use hypotheticals in a playful way, and maybe she didn't mean it literally. If he took it as a serious rejection of him, that might be his own insecurity or misinterpretation. \n\nBut given that he was heartbroken and left it, it's a tough call. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the breakup was based on a hypothetical that she might not have taken seriously, maybe he's overreacting. But if her answer was a clear indication of her priorities, then he's justified. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether her response was genuinely meant to be taken seriously. If she was just playing along and he misinterpreted, then he's in the wrong. If she was serious, then he's justified. The story says she confirmed she was serious. In that case, he's not in the wrong for breaking up because her response indicated she wouldn't prioritize their relationship in a serious situation. \n\nBut another angle: relationships require compromise. If he felt uncomfortable with her level of fandom and didn't address it earlier, maybe he should have talked to her before the breaking point. But he said he was okay with the tattoo and other things. The hospital question was the last straw. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he ended the relationship based on her response to a hypothetical that she took seriously, which showed her priorities. However, some might argue he overreacted. But since he made the decision based on her confirmed answer, he's justified.\n"
