We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, the girlfriend is 18 too. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The problem is her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. The author mentions that he tries to pay attention but isn't into K-Pop. The main issue is when she says she wouldn't go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. The guy gets heartbroken and breaks up. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The girl's behavior: constant fangirling, saving for a tattoo, going to concerts. The author was okay with all that except for the hospital comment. That comment seems to be the breaking point. The girl didn't lie when asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. So the author felt betrayed, which led to the breakup.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, communication is key in relationships. The guy might have felt that her priorities were not aligned with his. But a month is a relatively short time for a serious relationship. Also, the hospital scenario is an extreme hypothetical. Maybe he didn't address his concerns earlier. If he had talked to her about how he feels about her fangirling before this incident, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But instead, he waited until this one comment. \n\nOn the other hand, her response was a dealbreaker for him. If he felt that her loyalty or commitment was not there, even in hypothetical situations, maybe that's a valid reason to end things. But is it fair to break up based on one conversation? Also, the girl might not have realized how much it affected him. \n\nIn relationships, people have different boundaries. If he couldn't handle her level of fandom, especially to the point where she's willing to prioritize the idol over him even in a hypothetical scenario, maybe the breakup is justified from his side. But some might argue that the hospital example is too extreme and he overreacted. \n\nThe key points are: communication, timing (how long they've been together), and whether the issue was addressable before the breakup. Since the author only mentions breaking up after this specific incident without prior discussion, it's possible that he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier. However, if he felt that this was a red line for him, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he had the right to set boundaries regarding his comfort in the relationship. However, there's a counterargument that he didn't address the issue before hand. But given the context, the breaking point was a red flag for him, so it's a valid decision.\n"
