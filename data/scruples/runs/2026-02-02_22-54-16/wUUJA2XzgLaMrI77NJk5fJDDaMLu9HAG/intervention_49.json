We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is 18, their relationship is about a month old, and the girl is super into Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nHe mentions that he's tried to be understanding, even going so far as to accept her getting a tattoo of the artist's name. The breaking point came when he asked her if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she'd go regardless. He called her a psycho and broke up with her. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors: the duration of the relationship, the level of understanding he's shown before, and the specific issue that caused the breakup. He said he was okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo. The problem was her response to a hypothetical scenario where he's seriously ill. \n\nIn a relationship, especially a new one, communication is key. He brought up a hypothetical to test her loyalty or priorities, maybe expecting her to prioritize their relationship. Her answer was honest but hurtful to him. However, he framed the question in a way that might have been a trap. \n\nBut the main issue is whether her response was unreasonable. If she's honest that her fandom comes first in such an extreme scenario, that's a red flag for him. He might feel that her loyalty is misplaced, which is a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the other hand, he could have handled the situation better. Instead of immediately breaking up and calling her a psycho, maybe he should have discussed his feelings more calmly. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he's standing up for his own feelings, though perhaps harshly, could be seen as justified if he felt her priorities were a problem. \n\nBut considering that the relationship is only a month old, maybe he's overreacting. However, the user's initial thought is that he's not in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that if someone's priorities in a relationship are such that they'd leave a partner in the hospital for a concert, that's a deal-breaker. The answer hinges on whether the breakup was a reasonable response to a red flag or an overreaction. Since he made his feelings known and she didn't budge, he's not the asshole here. So answer B.\n"
