We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme fandom for K-Pop artist Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month, and he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo part. The issue was when she said she would go to his concert in Korea in November, even if he (her boyfriend) was in the hospital. He found that really upsetting and called her a psycho, breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong. He was trying to be playful, making up scenarios, and when she was serious, he ended the relationship. But was that a valid reason?\n\nHe mentions he's been trying to be attentive even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. The problem here is her prioritizing someone she hasn't met over him. The question is whether her response was unreasonable. If she was completely serious, that could indicate that her devotion to the artist is more important than her relationship. But maybe he overreacted? Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario might be a big step. However, if that scenario revealed a deeper issue in their relationship, maybe it's a valid reason. On the other hand, if he was trying to test her commitment without fully understanding the context, he might be partly at fault. But the key point is her response showed she valued the K-Pop idol more than him. So, maybe he's not the asshole here. Alternatively, maybe he didn't give her a chance to explain. But given the information, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
