We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of this K-Pop artist, to the point of fangirling constantly, liking every post, saving for a tattoo, and even considering a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when the author asked hypothetically if she would go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. She said she would, and he broke up with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's level of obsession and the author's reaction. The author claims he was okay with her K-Pop interest but was hurt by her response to the hypothetical scenario. The question is whether breaking up over this was justified.\n\nI need to consider relationship boundaries and communication. The author tried to engage with her interests but found them overwhelming. However, the hypothetical scenario might be a test of priorities. The girlfriend's response indicated that her commitment to the fan interest might outweigh her commitment to the relationship in a crisis. This could be a deal-breaker for the author, but was it reasonable to break up over a hypothetical?\n\nSome might argue that the hypothetical is extreme and not a real situation, so her answer might not reflect real-life actions. Others might say that it's a red flag if someone prioritizes a fan interest over their partner in a hypothetical. The author felt heartbroken and couldn't handle the thought of being secondary in such a scenario. \n\nBut is it fair to end the relationship over a hypothetical? The girlfriend didn't lie and gave an honest answer. The author might have felt insecure or undervalued. However, a month is not a very long time in a relationship, and perhaps the author reacted impulsively. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's priorities were fundamentally conflicting with the author's, breaking up could be necessary. The tattoo and saving for the concert show dedication to the fan interest. If the author couldn't accept that, maybe ending things was the right call.\n\nBut was the hypothetical a fair test? The girlfriend might have answered honestly without realizing the implications. The author might have overreacted, but he also had a right to feel slighted. The answer depends on whether the reaction was proportional. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often considers if both parties acted with good intentions and if the outcome was reasonable. The author's reaction was immediate and severe, which might be seen as harsh. However, if the girlfriend's behavior was a deal-breaker for him, then it's a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit tricky. If the author couldn't handle her priorities and felt that her commitment to K-Pop was more important than their relationship, then he's not the asshole. But if the hypothetical was too extreme and he acted without considering the context, he might be. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend was honest and didn't lie, and the author was in a vulnerable state, it's possible the author overreacted. However, given the content of the question, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to weigh these factors. The key is whether the author's reaction was justified based on her actual behavior versus a hypothetical.\n"
