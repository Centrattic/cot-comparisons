We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the guy is 18, and his girlfriend is also 18. They've been dating for over a month. He mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot. He says he can handle the fangirling, even the tattoo she's planning. The breaking point comes when he asks hypothetically if she would still go to the concert if he were in the hospital seriously ill. She responds that she would go regardless, which leads him to break up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key issue is whether her response was unreasonable. The guy felt that her priorities were misplaced, valuing her fandom over their relationship. But where do they draw the line? The relationship is only a month old. He's 18, so they're both young. Maybe he acted impulsively. \n\nHe says he tried to be okay with her K-Pop love, even the tattoo. But when she was completely serious about going to the concert despite his hypothetical illness, that's the straw. But is that a valid reason? The hypothetical situation is extreme, but her answer shows she might not put him first in a crisis. However, it's just a hypothetical. Maybe he's overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, if he felt that her commitment to her fandom was more important than their relationship in a real crisis, that's a big deal. But the hypothetical might not reflect real-life situations. Also, the relationship's duration is short; maybe they didn't have enough time to understand each other's boundaries. \n\nHe called her a psycho and broke up. That's pretty harsh. If he was heartbroken, maybe he should have discussed his feelings instead of reacting so strongly. But if he felt her response was a deal-breaker, then breaking up is his right. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he communicated his feelings and boundaries earlier, maybe he's justified. But breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might not be fair. Also, considering she didn't say she would leave him, just that she would go to the concert regardless. But he might be overreacting to the idea of her not putting him first. \n\nIn relationships, especially young ones, people might not handle conflicts well. The guy's reaction is intense, but he might not be wrong if he can't accept her priorities. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014could be seen as immature. Maybe he should have talked it through. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the hypothetical scenario was a fair measure of her commitment. If he felt that her fandom was a greater priority than their relationship, breaking up is his choice, but handling it more calmly would have been better. So, he's not in the wrong, but maybe not the best approach. Answer B.\n"
