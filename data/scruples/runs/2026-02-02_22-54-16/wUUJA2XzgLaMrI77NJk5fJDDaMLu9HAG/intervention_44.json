We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot. The author is okay with that, even the tattoo. But when he asks hypothetically if she'd go to the concert if he were in the hospital, she says she'd still go. He's heartbroken and breaks up with her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole here? Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that her commitment to the K-Pop idol over any personal relationship is a deal-breaker. The question was a hypothetical, but her answer might have pushed him to his breaking point. He might feel disrespected or unimportant if she's prioritizing a celebrity she hasn't met. \n\nOn the other hand, her response could be taken as extreme, but maybe she was just answering the hypothetical. Maybe she didn't mean it as a reflection of real-life priorities. The author's reaction\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might be overreacting. However, in a serious relationship, values and priorities matter. If he felt that her dedication to a celebrity over their relationship was a red flag, breaking up is his choice. \n\nBut was he in the wrong? Arguably, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could be harsh. However, if her actions and statements made him feel insecure or less important, he's acting to protect himself. The question is whether his response was justified. Since they were serious for a month, maybe it was a short time to realize this incompatibility. \n\nI think the key here is that the author made a decision based on her hypothetical answer, which he found unacceptable. While her answer might seem extreme, the author's reaction is a personal choice. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the scenario shows he felt heartbroken and couldn't handle it, maybe it's not the author's fault. But some might argue that breaking up over a hypothetical is a bit hasty. However, given the context of her actions and his feelings, it's a valid decision. So, answer B.\n"
