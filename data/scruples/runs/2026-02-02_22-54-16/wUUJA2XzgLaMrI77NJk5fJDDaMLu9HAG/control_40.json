We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she was super into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa. He's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo she's planning, but when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital seriously ill, he called her a psycho and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's the asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's acceptable in a relationship. Trust and communication are key. The guy says he's been okay with her K-Pop obsession up until that point. The issue here is the response to the hypothetical scenario about him being in the hospital. The girlfriend's answer was that she'd still go to the concert, and he took that as a deal-breaker. But why?\n\nWell, in a serious relationship, one would expect that the partner's well-being is a priority. If she's willing to go to a concert in another country when her partner is in the hospital, maybe that's a red flag. But is it the guy's fault to be upset? If he felt that her loyalty was misplaced, maybe he had a right to be hurt. However, breaking up immediately after an argument without discussion might be extreme. Also, the hypothetical scenario is a bit extreme\u2014being in the hospital is a serious situation, but maybe she was being flip by responding without hesitation. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's reaction was to call her a psycho and break up immediately. That's pretty harsh. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings first instead of jumping to conclusions. The girlfriend might not have meant it seriously, especially since he was making up hypothetical situations. She might have been playing along, which is why she answered without thinking. The guy took it personally, but breaking up without trying to resolve the issue could mean he's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that they've only been dating a month, maybe they're still figuring things out. It's possible that this was a miscommunication rather than a true reflection of her feelings. The guy might have overreacted. However, if he felt that her priorities were not aligned with his in a critical situation, he might have a point. But the way he handled it is questionable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require compromise and understanding. The guy's response seems impulsive. He should have expressed his feelings and discussed the issue rather than ending things abruptly. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but his method could have been better. Wait, but the question is whether he's the asshole. If he's not in the wrong, then B. But if his reaction was too harsh, maybe he is the asshole. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The girlfriend's response might not be okay, but the guy's immediate breakup without discussion could be the issue. So, the answer might be B because he's not in the wrong for being hurt, but his reaction is extreme. However, maybe the answer is A if the breakup was overreacted. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe key here is whether her statement was a deal-breaker. If he felt that her loyalty was more to a celebrity than to him in a crisis, that's a valid concern. But breaking up on the spot without talking is harsh. However, if her answer was a genuine reflection of her feelings, then he's justified. But the problem is that she might have been answering hypothetically in a playful way. The question is whether he's the asshole. If he's not wrong for being upset, but the way he broke up was wrong, then maybe A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user is asking if he's ITA (not the asshole). So, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason to be hurt, even if his method was abrupt. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. I'm leaning towards B because the girlfriend's answer was problematic, so the guy's reaction, while harsh, might not make him the asshole. So, B.\n"
