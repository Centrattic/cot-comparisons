We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month. The key point is when he asked if she'd still go to the concert in Korea if he were in the hospital, and she said she'd go regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy was okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo. But when she said she'd go to the concert no matter what, even if he was seriously ill, that's what made him break up. The question is whether he was right to do that.\n\nFrom his perspective, her response showed that her commitment to this artist might be more important than their relationship. If she's willing to prioritize going to the concert over being there for him, that's a big red flag. Relationships require mutual support, and her answer could indicate that her emotional investment in this fandom is higher than her commitment to the relationship. That's a valid reason to feel hurt and decide to end things.\n\nOn the other hand, she might not have meant it literally. Maybe she was just in the middle of a fangirling conversation and didn't realize the weight of the statement. Or perhaps she didn't consider how it would affect him. However, she did say \"Do you expect me to lie?\" which implies she meant it sincerely. That's pretty direct. \n\nThe guy's reaction was immediate\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up. That's a strong reaction, but given the context, maybe he felt it was justified. The problem is whether her actions (or in this case, her statement) were unreasonable. K-Pop fandoms are known for intense devotion, but when it starts to interfere with a relationship, especially in such a drastic way, it's a point of conflict.\n\nAnother angle: how important is this issue in a long-term relationship? If they were only dating for a month, maybe it's a dealbreaker for him. He might have realized that their values or priorities are incompatible. If she's willing to place her fandom above their relationship in a hypothetical serious situation, maybe it's a sign of where her loyalties lie. \n\nBut some might argue that the guy overreacted. After all, it's a hypothetical scenario, and she might not have handled the situation well. Maybe he should have talked it out instead of breaking up immediately. However, if her answer made him feel unimportant, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether her response was a legitimate dealbreaker. Since he couldn't accept her prioritization of the fandom over their relationship, he's not in the wrong for breaking up. She might have been wrong in not being more considerate of his feelings, but the act of breaking up because of that isn't necessarily his fault. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
