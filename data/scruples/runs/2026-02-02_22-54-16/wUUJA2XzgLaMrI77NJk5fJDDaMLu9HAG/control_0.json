We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nThe user is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for over a month. He mentions that she's a huge fan of K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He's tried to be supportive, even though he doesn't really care for K-Pop. The issue comes when he asks her a hypothetical question: if he was in the hospital seriously ill, would she still go to his concert? She responds seriously, saying she wouldn't hesitate. He then breaks up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating a month, which isn't that long. The girl's level of fangirling is intense\u2014tattoos, saving money for a concert, etc. The author tolerated much of this, but the breaking point was her hypothetical answer. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's reaction was justified. Breaking up over one question might seem harsh. The question was hypothetical, and the way he phrased it (\"What if I was in the hospital...\") could have been a test of her commitment to him versus her fandom. However, the way he approached it by making up other scenarios first and then the hospital situation might have been a way to push her buttons. \n\nThe girl's response of being completely serious could indicate that she prioritizes her fandom over their relationship in a critical situation. But is that a fair measure of her character? Maybe the author expected her to prioritize him, and her answer made him realize she wasn't there for the long term. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was immediate and severe. He called her a psycho and broke up right then. That's a strong reaction to a hypothetical scenario. Maybe he overreacted. The question is, was her answer indicative of a deeper issue, or was it just a miscommunication? \n\nI think the author's action here is not in the wrong because he made his feelings known and couldn't continue the relationship after that moment. However, some might argue that breaking up over a hypothetical is too hasty. But given that he had other concerns about her not being complimentary and her intense fangirling, this might have been the final straw. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't address these issues earlier. He was aware of her behavior but only acted now. Maybe he should have talked to her more about his feelings before this incident. If he had communicated his concerns before, then this situation might not have happened. But in the moment, his reaction was immediate and based on her answer. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he made a decision based on his deal breakers. However, others might say he should have handled it differently. But given the context, he's not the asshole here.\n"
