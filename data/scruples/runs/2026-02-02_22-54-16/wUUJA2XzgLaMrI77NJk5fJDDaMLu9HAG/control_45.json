We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop idol obsession is in the wrong. The key points here are the situation described and the user's question about whether the author is the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. He mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But the final straw was when she said she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital. He found that heartbreakingly serious, leading him to break up.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The girl's behavior is extreme, but the boyfriend had been aware of her fangirling and was okay with it up to that point. The breaking point was her not being willing to lie about prioritizing the idol over him in a serious situation. \n\nIn relationships, especially serious ones, trust and commitment are important. If one partner is so committed to another person (even a celebrity) that they'd ignore a serious issue with their partner, that can be a red flag. However, the boyfriend's reaction was immediate and harsh\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up. The duration of the relationship (over a month) and their ages (18) might influence how mature they handle such situations. \n\nBut is it reasonable for him to expect her to prioritize him over a concert? Maybe not, given that celebrities are public figures and personal interests. However, when a partner is so dedicated to someone they've never met, it might raise concerns about their commitment to the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction, while sudden, might be a way of asserting his own boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could be seen as overreacting. The girl didn't actually leave or choose the concert over him; she just stated her hypothetical stance. The boyfriend might have felt that her answer revealed deeper issues, like her inability to commit or prioritize in a crisis.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally expected that close relationships require some level of mutual priority. If she can't see the boyfriend's hospitalization as a more critical situation, that might be a deal-breaker. However, the boyfriend didn't give her a chance to explain or discuss it further; he just cut things off immediately. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend overstepped by breaking up based on a hypothetical. But if that hypothetical revealed a fundamental incompatibility in their values (prioritizing partner vs. personal interests), then his reaction could be justified. However, the abruptness and the fact that he didn't try to talk it through first might be seen as hasty. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the action was a proportional response. The boyfriend's action might be seen as a way to protect himself from future hurt, especially if he felt her commitment to the idol was a bigger issue than he initially realized. But the fact that he waited until now and then reacted so strongly could also make others think he's overreacting.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might hinge on whether the breakup was a justified boundary-setting or an overreaction. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the boyfriend's actions were reasonable given his feelings and the situation. The user is asking for a binary choice between A and B. Based on the analysis, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as he's setting a boundary based on a deal-breaker revealed by her answer. But others might argue he should have handled it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his method was the best. So, if his reaction was a legitimate response to what he found unacceptable, he's not in the wrong.\n"
