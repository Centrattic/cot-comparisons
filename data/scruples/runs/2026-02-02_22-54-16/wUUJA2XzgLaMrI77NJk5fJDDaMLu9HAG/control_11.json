We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating seriously for over a month. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The guy isn't into K-Pop but tries to be supportive. He mentions that she's overly complimentary about Jung Yong Hwa, even more than she is to him, and she's saving up for a tattoo of his name. However, the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if he (the guy) was in the hospital. He took that as a sign that she values the K-Pop idol more than their relationship and broke up.\n\nNow, the key question is whether he's the asshole here. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to their passions and interests. K-Pop is a huge cultural phenomenon, and being a fan is normal. She's into Jung Yong Hwa, which isn't inherently problematic. The guy tried to be supportive, even saying he's okay with the tattoo. But when she said she wouldn't go to the concert if he were in the hospital, he felt it showed a lack of priority in the relationship. That seems like a valid concern, because in a serious relationship, one would expect the partner to prioritize the other in emergency situations.\n\nBut wait, the context is important. The question was hypothetical, and he made up the scenario where he's in the hospital. Her response was that she wouldn't lie, which implies she's honest. So she's being truthful about her feelings, but that's not necessarily cruel. Maybe she didn't mean it that way. However, the reality is that in a real emergency, any normal person would prioritize their partner. If she's willing to go against that, it does raise red flags for the guy. \n\nBut is breaking up over that too harsh? Well, if she's not willing to put their relationship above her fandom, even in a hypothetical emergency, it's a dealbreaker for him. The guy has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If her devotion to the idol makes him feel insecure or insignificant, that's a legitimate reason to end things. \n\nOn the other side, maybe the guy overreacted. The scenario was hypothetical, and people might say that real-life situations are more complex. She might not actually go to the concert if he were in the hospital, but she said she wouldn't lie, which could just mean she was being honest about how much she loves the idol. But in a serious relationship, trust and priority are essential. If he can't trust that she would support him in a crisis, it's a problem.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship is only a month old, maybe it's too soon to make such a judgment. But he says they were dating \"fairly seriously,\" which might mean they see a future together. If her response made him feel like she doesn't value him over her idol in critical situations, then it's a valid reason to break up. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The guy felt disrespected and devalued by her hypothetical response. He tried to be supportive but had a breaking point when her response indicated she wouldn't prioritize him in an emergency. Breaking up because of that isn't wrong. She might need to reflect on whether her fandom is affecting her relationship in a way that's healthy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to end the relationship when he felt his partner's priorities were misaligned with his own needs in the relationship.\n"
