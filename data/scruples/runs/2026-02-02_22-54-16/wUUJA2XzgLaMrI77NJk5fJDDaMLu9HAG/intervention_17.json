We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. So first, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nThe guy mentions that he's okay with her being a fan, even the tattoo. But the issue arises when she says she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He felt heartbroken and ended the relationship. \n\nFrom his perspective, her response might have come off as not prioritizing their relationship. He might have expected her to consider his well-being over her fandom. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might see her fandom as a personal passion. She hasn't met the artist, just admires him through his work. Her answer might have been a bit extreme, but maybe she was testing his reaction or didn't realize how hurtful it would be. \n\nCommunication is key. They had been dating for a month, which isn't too long. Maybe there were other underlying issues that weren't addressed. The guy's reaction was immediate and decisive\u2014he called her a psycho and ended things. That's a strong reaction, but if her answer truly felt like a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's his right to end it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he overreacted. K-Pop fandom can be intense, but it's a personal choice. If the relationship was otherwise healthy, breaking up over this might be too hasty. But if respecting each other's boundaries is important, and her actions crossed a line he couldn't accept, then it's his choice. \n\nI think the main point is whether breaking up was a justified reaction. If the core issue was her prioritizing the artist over him in an extreme hypothetical, then it's a valid concern. But the situation is hypothetical, and real-life emergencies are unpredictable. Her answer might have shown a lack of empathy or consideration, but in a serious relationship, such a reaction could signal deeper issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on communication and mutual respect. If he felt that her answer was a deal-breaker, he's not in the wrong to leave. But if he didn't address this before, maybe he's overreacting. However, given the context, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
