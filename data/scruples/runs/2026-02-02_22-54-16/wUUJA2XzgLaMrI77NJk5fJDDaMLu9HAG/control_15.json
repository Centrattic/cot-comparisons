We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that they were dating for over a month. The girlfriend is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The guy says he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. The problem came up when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He got upset, called her a psycho, and broke up.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's important here. The main issue is whether her response was justified or if his reaction was too harsh. The guy says he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even a tattoo, but her answer to the hypothetical question about his hospitalization was the breaking point. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the girlfriend expressed that her love for her K-Pop idol was more important than her partner's well-being, that's a problem. But maybe there's more to the story. The girlfriend might have been hyperbolic, just playing along with his hypothetical. The guy's question was a bit extreme, asking what if he were in the hospital. Maybe she was just being dramatic without intending to prioritize the idol over him. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's reaction was immediate and harsh. Calling her a psycho and breaking up might be an overreaction if her answer was just a joke or a way to emphasize her fandom. He didn't give her a chance to clarify. \n\nBut if the girlfriend genuinely said she would go to the concert no matter what, even if it meant abandoning her partner in a hospital, that's a red flag. It shows a lack of commitment and empathy. However, the context is important. They were dating for a month, so maybe this was a deal-breaker for him, but is it fair to break up based on one conversation? \n\nAlso, the way he broke up\u2014calling her a psycho\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. Even if he felt wronged, the method of breaking up could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If her answer was a genuine reflection of her priorities, then maybe he's justified. But if he misinterpreted her words and overreacted, then he might be the asshole. Since the situation is presented with him acting on a single response without further discussion, it's possible he didn't handle it well. However, the content of her answer could be a major issue. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The key is whether her statement was a legitimate deal-breaker or if he overreacted. The community often looks at whether both parties acted respectfully. Since he broke up immediately without trying to understand her perspective, maybe he's in the wrong. But if her answer was indeed unacceptable, then he isn't. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because if her answer showed she wouldn't prioritize his well-being over her idol, that's a significant issue. However, his method of breaking up could be seen as harsh. But in the end, if her answer was a deal-breaker, then he's justified. The answer is B.\n"
