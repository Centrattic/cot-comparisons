We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop, but he's tried to be supportive. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, likes his music, and is saving up for a tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't miss his concert even if he (the author) were in the hospital. The author found this answer heart-wrenching and called her a psycho before breaking up. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, expecting that a partner wouldn't prioritize someone they haven't met over their significant other in a critical situation might be a valid concern. If the girlfriend was completely nonchalant about his well-being, that could be a red flag. The fact that she was unapologetic and didn't lie made him feel heartbroken, so his reaction was immediate.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions and statements might be seen as typical of a K-Pop fan. She's a fan, not necessarily in a romantic relationship with the idol. Her commitment to attending the concert might not be about replacing the author but her passion for the artist. She might not have intended to hurt him but was being honest about her priorities. \n\nBut in a serious relationship, such a reaction could indicate a lack of commitment or empathy. If the girlfriend was willing to ignore his serious illness to go to a concert, that's a major issue in the relationship. The author might have felt that this shows she can't prioritize their relationship over her fandom, which is a deal-breaker. \n\nThe key question is whether the author was justified in breaking up. The girlfriend's answer might have crossed a line, making the author feel unvalued. However, the author's immediate reaction of calling her a psycho might be harsh. A more constructive approach would be discussing the issue and seeing if there's a compromise. But given the seriousness of the situation (hospitalization), the author might have felt it was a deal-breaker. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship's duration, a month isn't that long. Both might not have had enough time to address such a significant issue. The author's decision could be based on feeling that their values or priorities are incompatible. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt this was a deal-breaker. However, the girlfriend's actions might not be inherently wrong, but her response to the hypothetical situation showed a lack of consideration for his feelings. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If the girlfriend's answer was a major red flag, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the issue was blown out of proportion, he might be. Given the context, the author's decision might be seen as justified because the girlfriend's response indicated a lack of empathy, which is crucial in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
