We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nSo, the guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The main issue is her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions that he's okay with her liking K-Pop in general, even the tattoo. But when she says she wouldn't go to his concert even if he was in the hospital, that's the breaking point. He calls her a psycho and breaks up. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says he tried to pay attention to her interests and was okay with the tattoo. So he's not against her interest in K-Pop per se. The problem arises when her commitment to attending a concert in Korea, despite his hypothetical illness. That's a big deal because it's not just about liking a celebrity; it's about how she prioritizes her fandom over his well-being. \n\nNow, the key point is her response. When he asked if she would go even if he was in the hospital, she didn't lie and said she would still go. That's a red flag for him. Relationships require mutual support and care. If her love for a celebrity, whom she hasn't even met, is more important than her partner's health, that's a serious issue. \n\nBut wait, the situation is hypothetical. He made up a scenario to test her, which might not be the best approach. However, her response was so extreme that it led to the breakup. Is it fair for him to end things over a hypothetical? Well, maybe. If this is a dealbreaker for him, he might feel justified. But if he's reacting impulsively without understanding the context, maybe not. \n\nHowever, considering that they've been dating for a month and this was the final straw, it's possible that this fangirling has been a growing issue. The fact that she's saving for a tattoo and going to a concert in Korea suggests a high level of dedication. But when it's compared to a partner's health, it's a matter of where priorities lie. \n\nHe might feel that her devotion to a celebrity is overshadowing their relationship. The breakup is a reaction to her not prioritizing him in that hypothetical scenario. While using a hypothetical to test her might not be the best method, her response was a clear indicator of her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted. After all, it's a hypothetical situation. But if her behavior has been consistent and he's been trying to accommodate her interests, maybe the breakup is a justified decision based on her priorities. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The woman's actions are her own, but when they affect the relationship's foundation, the man has the right to decide if he can continue. Since he felt heartbroken and couldn't handle it, ending the relationship might not be the wrong choice. So, answer B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
