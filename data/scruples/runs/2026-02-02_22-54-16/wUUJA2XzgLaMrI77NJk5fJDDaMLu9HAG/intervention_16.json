We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girl is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, likes him a lot, and even wants a tattoo of his name. The breaking point was when the author asked her if she'd still go to a concert in Korea if he were in the hospital. She said she'd go no matter what, which made him break up.\n\nHmm, so first, the author tried to be understanding, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. He mentions she's been fangirling over her favorite artist, but he's tried to be okay with it. The issue here is her level of commitment to the idol compared to the relationship. The key moment was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert if the author was in the hospital. She was serious about that, which felt like a betrayal to him.\n\nI need to think about boundaries in relationships. If someone's passion for something else is affecting their commitment to the relationship, that's a problem. For example, if one partner's hobby or interest starts to overshadow the other person's feelings or the relationship itself. But in this case, the author says he's okay with the tattoo and all the previous fangirling. The problem is the hypothetical scenario where her loyalty to the idol is tested against the author's well-being.\n\nBut wait, the author's question was hypothetical. Maybe he was trying to test her loyalty or push her to see how much she values the relationship over her fandom. Her response, being completely serious, probably felt like she prioritizes the idol over their relationship. However, was that a fair way to test it? Maybe the author should have communicated his feelings about her obsession earlier instead of using a hypothetical situation that might be extreme.\n\nAlso, when someone is a fan of something, especially a K-Pop idol, it's similar to any passion. But when it's to the point where the partner feels neglected or replaced in the fan's heart, that's a problem. The author felt heartbroken because her answer indicated that her priority wasn't him in a critical situation. But was breaking up the right response? Maybe he could have talked to her about his feelings before jumping to conclusions.\n\nBut then again, if a partner is fangirling to the point of wanting a tattoo of someone they've never met, it might be a red flag. The author tried to be understanding but reached a breaking point. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario that's not a real situation might be overreacting. However, if the author felt that the relationship couldn't continue without trust and loyalty, maybe it's a valid decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response was honest. She didn't lie, which he asked her directly. So maybe the problem is that he expected her to lie to make him feel better, which isn't fair. If she's honest and willing to be open, maybe that's a strength. But the underlying issue is that he couldn't accept her passion if it's higher than the relationship's priority.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have failed to express his concerns before the breaking point. Breaking up suddenly might have been abrupt. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not addressing the issue earlier. But also, if the girl's commitment to her fandom is more than the relationship, that's a problem the author has a right to address.\n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he had his breaking point and decided to end it. But others might argue he should have handled it differently. However, given the scenario, he's reacting to something that deeply affects his sense of value in the relationship. So I lean towards answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
