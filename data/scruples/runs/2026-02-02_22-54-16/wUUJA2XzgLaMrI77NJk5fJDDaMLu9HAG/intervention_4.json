We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The question is whether he was right to end the relationship when she said she would go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy tried to be understanding, acknowledging that she's into K-Pop and even okay with her tattoo. But the breaking point was her response to the hypothetical scenario. He asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, and she was serious about it. That made him break up with her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and expectations in a relationship. He might have felt that her commitment to a celebrity overshadowed her commitment to the relationship. But is that a valid reason to break up? \n\nThe girl's actions (liking every social media post, saving for a tattoo, etc.) were already known to him. However, the line was crossed when she didn't prioritize his hypothetical health crisis over the concert. This might indicate a lack of empathy or prioritization, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nBut was her answer unexpected? Maybe he didn't communicate his feelings about her fandom's impact on their relationship before. If he never discussed his feelings about her obsession, then confronting her with a hypothetical might not be fair. However, the response she gave made it clear that her priorities might not align with his. \n\nAlso, considering the timing\u2014only a month into a serious relationship. Some might argue that a month is not long enough to be certain about such a significant decision. But if this was the final straw after a month of building up issues, it could be legitimate. \n\nHe called her a psycho, which is harsh, but if he was heartbroken and felt it was the right decision, maybe he's justified. However, the way he reacted could be seen as overreacting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But from a relationship advice perspective, maybe he's not in the wrong because her answer indicated a lack of consideration for his feelings. However, some might say he should have addressed the issue earlier instead of breaking up over a hypothetical scenario.\n"
