We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They had been dating seriously for over a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been fangirling about Jung Yong Hwa a lot. The user mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. She's been complimentary about the artist in a way that seems excessive, and even plans a tattoo. The breaking point comes when she says she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The user is heartbroken and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the user's reaction was justified. The user says he was okay with the fangirling and the tattoo, but the final statement about the hospital was the straw that broke the camel's back. The girlfriend's response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she was serious about going despite his illness. That seems extreme to the user, leading him to break up.\n\nFactors to consider: The user tried to be understanding, but felt that her commitment to the K-Pop idol overrode his well-being. However, the duration of the relationship is only a month and a few hours. Sometimes, people break up quickly if they realize they're incompatible. The girlfriend's response might have revealed deeper issues, like possible neglect of the relationship in favor of her fandom.\n\nBut wait, the user's reaction was immediate and harsh\u2014he called her a psycho and ended the relationship. Is that a reasonable response? Maybe he could have discussed his feelings instead of reacting so strongly. However, if he felt that her answer showed a lack of empathy or commitment to their relationship, he might believe it's a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as obsessive. Fangingling to that extent, even planning a tattoo and a trip, might indicate that her fandom is more important than her partner. The user might feel disrespected, especially if he's not interested in K-Pop and feels overshadowed by the idol.\n\nBut since the relationship is new, it's possible both parties are still figuring out each other's deal-breakers. The user might not be in the wrong if he felt this was a fundamental incompatibility. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be impulsive. The user didn't give her a chance to explain or express his concerns first. He reacted immediately, which could be seen as a lack of communication.\n\nSo, is the user the asshole? If he ended it because her answer showed she prioritizes the idol over him, which is a valid concern. But calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately could be seen as harsh. However, if her answer truly made him realize she wasn't emotionally invested in the relationship, he might not be wrong. The answer depends on whether the response was proportionate to the issue. The community might split here. In AITA contexts, breaking up over something that's a deal-breaker for one person, even if the other sees it as overreacting, often isn't considered the AITA. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
