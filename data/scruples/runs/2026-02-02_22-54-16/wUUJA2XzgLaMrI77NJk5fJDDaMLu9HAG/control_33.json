We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she was extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point here is her response when he asked if she would still go to the concert if he was in the hospital. She was completely serious when she said she wouldn't lie, implying she would go regardless of his condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his perspective. He's been in a serious relationship for over a month, and while he's okay with her being a fan, her response to his hypothetical scenario made him feel heartbroken. He felt that her love for this person was more significant than their relationship. That's a big deal because loyalty and commitment are important in relationships. If she's willing to prioritize a celebrity over him, even in a hypothetical situation where he's seriously ill, that could be a deal-breaker for him.\n\nNow, her side: She's a big fan, likes his music, follows him online, and even wants a tattoo of his name. But she hasn't met him in person. When he asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she was honest. Honesty is also a key value in relationships. She might not have realized how much that answer would hurt him. Maybe she thought it was a hypothetical question, and she was just being truthful without considering the emotional weight behind his question.\n\nBut here's the thing: The way she responded shows that she values her fandom highly, but does that make her wrong? The question is whether her answer was inappropriate. If she's honest and doesn't lie, but he interprets her honesty as not valuing the relationship, is that his fault? Or is it a matter of different values? He might not be able to accept that she loves someone else more than him, even if it's just a celebrity.\n\nHe broke up with her immediately after, calling her a psycho. That's a strong reaction, but maybe it's because her answer revealed something he couldn't handle. However, is it fair to break up over a hypothetical scenario? Maybe he should have discussed it more before making a decision. On the other hand, if that was a deal-breaker for him, then acting on it isn't wrong. The problem is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether he's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key factors here are mutual respect and communication. She was honest, which is good, but her answer might have highlighted an incompatibility in values. He might have different expectations about how much he should be prioritized in her life. If he can't accept her passion for K-Pop, then the breakup is his choice, and he's not wrong for making that decision based on his feelings.\n\nBut maybe he overreacted. The hypothetical about being in the hospital is a bit extreme. Maybe he was testing how she feels about the relationship, but her honest answer caught him off guard. However, breaking up immediately might be a harsh response. But if he felt that her priorities were a deal-breaker, then it's his choice.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether his reaction was in the wrong. Since he chose to end the relationship based on her answer, and if that's his threshold, then he's not necessarily the asshole. She was honest, and he acted on his feelings. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
