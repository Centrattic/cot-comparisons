We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because she's super into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He says he's tried to be understanding, even okay with her getting a tattoo of the idol's name. But then when he asks her if she'd still go to the concert in Korea if he (the author) was in the hospital, she says yes, and he breaks up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They've been dating seriously for over a month. That's not super long, but it's more than a few weeks. The author mentions he's tried to be patient and listen, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. But the dealbreaker here is her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. \n\nThe key point is whether her response was a red flag or just a typical over-the-top fangirling. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up. So, the question is about whether his reaction was justified. \n\nI think about communication in relationships. If this was a one-time argument or misunderstanding, maybe he should have talked more. But if the underlying issue was her prioritizing the idol over their relationship, then maybe it's valid. However, the hypothetical scenario might be extreme. She's a fan and hasn't met him, but her devotion is intense. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's past behavior: she's complimenting the idol excessively, saving for a tattoo, etc. The author says he's okay with that except for the specific response. But does that response indicate that he's not her priority in a crisis? If she's willing to go to the concert even if he's in the hospital, that's a big red flag for most people. \n\nBut is breaking up over a hypothetical situation extreme? Maybe. Because it's a hypothetical and might not reflect real-life actions. However, the author felt that her commitment to the idol over him was a dealbreaker. \n\nIn relationships, values and priorities matter. If one person's commitment to something (like a celebrity) is more important than their partner's well-being, that's a problem. So the author might feel that her loyalty is misplaced. However, maybe the girlfriend's answer was just a flippant response, but the author took it seriously. \n\nI think the author's action is his right. If a partner's devotion to someone they haven't met is more important than their partner's health, that's a dealbreaker. So he's not in the wrong for breaking up. But some might argue he overreacted. However, given the girlfriend's history of extreme fangirling, the author's decision makes sense. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Like, did the author give her a chance to explain or was it an overreaction? The author did confirm she was serious, so maybe it's a valid reason. Therefore, B is the right choice.\n"
