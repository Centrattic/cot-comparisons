We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is really into K-Pop, which the author doesn't care for but tries to be attentive. She's fangirling a lot, especially about Jung Yong Hwa. She hasn't met him, just follows him online and is saving for a tattoo. The breaking point came when the author asked her if she'd still go to his concert in Korea even if he (the author) were in the hospital. She was completely serious about going, which led him to break up.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He felt that her commitment to her fandom overrode her commitment to the relationship. The question was hypothetical, but her answer indicated that her dedication to Jung Yong Hwa superseded her partner's well-being. The author took that as a sign that she doesn't prioritize the relationship, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She's passionate about K-Pop, which is a common interest. Her response might have been a hypothetical reaction, not necessarily a reflection of her real priorities. Maybe she didn't take the question seriously or was just testing his reaction. The tattoo and saving for the concert are part of her personal expression and interests.\n\nThe key issue is whether her response was a dealbreaker. In relationships, trust and commitment are crucial. If one partner values something (like a celebrity) more than their partner's health, that can be a red flag. However, the situation is a hypothetical scenario. It's possible she was just being playful, but the author took it as a serious statement of her priorities.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate and strong. Breaking up over a hypothetical question might be seen as overreacting, unless the author felt it symbolized a deeper issue. The girlfriend's fangirling was ongoing, and this incident might have been the trigger. However, some might argue that the author didn't address the underlying issues before the breaking point. He mentions he was okay with the tattoo and her fangirling before, so maybe this was the last straw.\n\nIn AITA posts, people often consider whether the action was justified. The author's action was to break up, and the question is if he's the asshole. The girlfriend's response was the catalyst, but the decision to end the relationship is on the author. If her answer was a red flag, then he's justified. If the question was too hypothetical, then maybe he overreacted.\n\nI need to weigh the typical viewpoints in such scenarios. Often, people might argue that while interests can be a part of a relationship, when one person's interest is prioritized over the other in critical situations, it's a problem. However, the hypothetical nature here is a factor. The author might have perceived it as a reflection of her true feelings, while she might have not intended it that way. \n\nConsidering that the author was okay with her interests before, but this specific response was what broke it, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's answer, if taken at face value, could be seen as prioritizing a celebrity over her partner's health. However, others might say that hypothetical questions don't always reflect real-life priorities. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the hypothetical was a reasonable test of her commitment. If the author felt it was a red flag, then his action is justified. However, if the question was too extreme and not a real scenario, maybe he's overreacting. Since the answer is based on a hypothetical, some might say he's not in the wrong because he had the right to end the relationship if her priorities were incompatible with his.\n"
