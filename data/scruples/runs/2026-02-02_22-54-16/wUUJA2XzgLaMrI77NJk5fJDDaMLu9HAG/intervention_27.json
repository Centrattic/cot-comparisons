We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she was extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo, but her response about going to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital made him break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend seems to really love this artist, which is her right. But when he asked what if he was in the hospital, she said she would still go. The guy felt that her loyalty or commitment was more to the idol than to the relationship. \n\nNow, is that a valid reason to break up? Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If her dedication to the idol is affecting the relationship's priorities, that's a problem. But does a single statement justify ending the relationship? The guy might have overreacted, but he had been annoyed for a while. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's answer could be seen as not showing empathy or support for her partner's well-being. If a partner were seriously ill, the expectation is that the other would be there. So, her hypothetical answer might indicate a lack of prioritizing the relationship in critical times. \n\nBut maybe the guy didn't give her a chance to explain. He says she didn't lie, so she was honest. However, in a relationship, how you handle such hypotheticals can show values. The guy might have felt disrespected, leading him to break up. \n\nIs he the asshole? It's tricky. He had feelings about her idol worship, but breaking up over that might be extreme. However, her answer could be a red flag about her priorities. The question is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if his reaction was justified. \n\nGiven that he tried to be understanding before and the final straw was her hypothetical answer, maybe he's not wrong. But some might argue he should have communicated better instead of just breaking up. But the decision is between A and B. I think the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. There's nuance here, but the user thinks the author isn't wrong. I'll go with B.\n"
