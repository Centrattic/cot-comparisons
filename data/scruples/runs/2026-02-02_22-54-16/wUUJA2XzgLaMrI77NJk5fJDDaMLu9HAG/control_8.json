We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her response to a hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital and she would still go to a concert. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of saving money for a tattoo and fangirling a lot. The author mentions that he's tried to be okay with this, including the tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nThe key issue here is the girlfriend's response. When the author posed a hypothetical where he's seriously ill, she didn't answer as expected but instead was noncommittal. Then, when asked if she's lying, she says she's not. The author felt heartbroken and ended the relationship. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. First, the hypothetical scenario is extreme and may not be a realistic expectation. Relationships often involve different priorities, and while commitment is important, people have varying boundaries. The author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate if the girlfriend's response was inconsiderate, but it's also possible that the author overreacted. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response\u2014being completely serious about not going to the concert even if he's in the hospital\u2014could indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings and the seriousness of his hypothetical situation. The author felt this was a deal-breaker, which can be a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be seen as impulsive. The author might not have given her a chance to explain or address his feelings. But if the girlfriend's behavior consistently showed that her devotion to the artist was more important than their relationship, the author has grounds to feel hurt and decide to end things. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while fangirling is common, the line between harmless enthusiasm and problematic behavior can be thin. The girlfriend's willingness to prioritize a concert over her partner's well-being (even hypothetically) could be a red flag. However, the scenario is hypothetical, so the author's reaction might be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was justified given his own feelings and the value he placed on mutual consideration. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's no legal or moral obligation to tolerate such behavior, it's a judgment call. But given that the girlfriend was serious about her answer and the author decided it was a deal-breaker, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
