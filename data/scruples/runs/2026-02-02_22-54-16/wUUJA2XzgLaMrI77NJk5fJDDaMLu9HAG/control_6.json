We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist, and the boyfriend is bothered by her constant fangirling. The breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, and she said she'd still go.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. The user says he was okay with her liking K-Pop, including the tattoo, but her answer to the hypothetical scenario was the last straw. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical relationship dynamics. In a serious relationship, it's important for both partners to feel valued and prioritized. The boyfriend's question was a test of her loyalty, maybe? He's checking if her commitment to him overrides her commitment to her fandom. Her answer suggests that her commitment to Jung Yong Hwa is more significant, which probably made him feel insecure or unimportant.\n\nBut wait, maybe the boyfriend overreacted. The hypothetical scenario is a bit extreme. Being in the hospital is a serious situation, but asking about that might be a way to see how she'd handle competing priorities. However, the way she answered without hesitation and said she'd still go could be seen as prioritizing her idol over her partner in a critical moment. That might be a deal-breaker for some people.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's response might be more about the hypothetical being a dramatic scenario. She might not have taken it seriously, or she might have been answering in the heat of the moment. The problem is that the boyfriend was heartbroken and decided to break up immediately. Is that a fair reaction?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might have felt that her fandom was overshadowing their relationship, and when he brought it up, her answer confirmed his fears. However, breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario might be a bit impulsive. On the other hand, if this was a recurring issue and he felt consistently undervalued, then maybe his reaction is justified.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's fangirling is extreme, but within the bounds of her personal interests. Unless she's neglecting their relationship for the fandom, maybe it's her right to be passionate. However, when it comes to extreme actions like getting a tattoo and planning a trip, it's possible that the boyfriend feels overshadowed.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend's decision to break up was proportional to the situation. If her fangirling had been a gradual issue and he had discussed it before, then this could be the culmination. But if this was the first time he acted on it, maybe he's overreacting. The fact that he called her a psycho and cut things off immediately suggests a lack of communication and perhaps a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say that having strong interests in K-Pop is just a personal preference and not a deal-breaker unless it affects the relationship. However, the girlfriend's response about the hospital scenario might indicate that her priorities are not aligned with the boyfriend's, which is a significant issue in a relationship.\n\nSo, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. From the description, he tried to be understanding but eventually snapped. The answer would depend on whether her actions were actually affecting the relationship in real ways beyond her personal interests. If she's not neglecting their relationship for her fandom, then the breakup might be unfair. However, if her prioritization in the hypothetical scenario made him feel that he's not a priority in her life, then his feelings are valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's answer was non-negotiable, which might be a red flag. But the boyfriend's immediate breakup without discussion might be hasty. It's possible that a better approach would have been to talk about his feelings and see if they could find a compromise or understand each other's perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as justified if he felt her priorities were misaligned, but the way he acted (calling her a psycho and cutting off without discussion) might make him appear in the wrong. However, the core issue is whether her actions were actually harming the relationship beyond the hypothetical. Given that, I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), because he was acting on his feelings of being less important to her, even if his method was abrupt.\n"
