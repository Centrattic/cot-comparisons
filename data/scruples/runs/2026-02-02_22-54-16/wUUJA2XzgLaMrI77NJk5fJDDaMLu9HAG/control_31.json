We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, especially after she said she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy is okay with her liking K-Pop and even her tattoo plans. But the breaking point was her response to a hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. She was completely serious in saying she'd still go to the concert. The guy felt heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if he was in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The guy tried to engage with her interests, which is good. But when her commitment to her fandom seemed to outweigh her commitment to the relationship in a hypothetical but significant situation, he felt it was a deal-breaker. \n\nIs his reaction justified? It might depend on how the relationship was structured. If he felt that her priorities were conflicting with his, especially in a critical situation like being in the hospital, that's a big red flag. However, the scenario is hypothetical. She might not have meant it literally, but he took it seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, if he communicated his feelings and boundaries beforehand, maybe she would have adjusted. But since the situation is new and the relationship is still in its early stages, maybe he acted impulsively. Breaking up because of a hypothetical situation might be extreme, but if it represents deeper issues like lack of emotional investment from her side, then it's a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's saving up for a tattoo of his name (the artist's) shows a deep emotional attachment to someone she hasn't met. The guy might feel that her emotional attachment to a stranger is more significant than her relationship with him.\n\nHowever, breaking up immediately after such a conversation might be seen as reactionary. It's possible he didn't address the issue constructively and instead reacted emotionally. But considering the gravity of the hypothetical scenario (his health), maybe it's a deal-breaker for him.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and communication. The guy tried to test her commitment and she was honest. He might have expected her to prioritize the relationship, but if she didn't, he had the right to end it. However, his method of ending it by calling her a psycho might come off as harsh, even if justified. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he felt that her priorities were incompatible with his, then no. But if he didn't give her a chance to explain or if he overreacted, that's another angle. But given the scenario, he made a decision based on her answer, which he found unacceptable. The community might side with him because he set boundaries and acted on them. So answer B (No).\n"
