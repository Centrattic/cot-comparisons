We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fangirling is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirls a lot, and even wants a tattoo. The author says he's okay with all that, but when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, she said she'd still go. He took that as a dealbreaker and broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue is her level of devotion to a celebrity she's never met. The author mentions that he was okay with the fangirling and the tattoo, so those aren't the problem. The breaking point was her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie, meaning she wouldn't go if he was sick? Wait, no, he asked if she'd still go even if he was in the hospital, and she said \"Do you expect me to lie?\" which implies she'd still go. That's what he didn't expect. So he felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, then broke up.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? He's justified in feeling hurt if her response indicated that her commitment to the fandom outweighs her commitment to the relationship. However, relationships require communication and mutual understanding. Did he address the issue before this moment? The question is whether breaking up over this was the right move. If he hadn't brought up the hypothetical before and this was the first time he expressed his feelings, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he had given her chances to adjust and this was the final straw, then maybe he's right. However, breaking up suddenly because of a hypothetical scenario might be extreme. Also, considering their relationship was only a month serious, maybe it's too soon to be so resolute. On the other hand, if her response showed a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings, then he's justified. But others might argue that he should have discussed this more calmly instead of reacting impulsively. So, the answer hinges on whether breaking up was an overreaction. In AITA terms, the community often considers if one party overreacted. Here, the author's immediate reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up could be seen as an overreaction, even if he was hurt. Therefore, maybe he's not the asshole, but perhaps there's a middle ground. However, based on the info given, since he did take the step to end the relationship because of her response, and given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might say A if they think he should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n"
