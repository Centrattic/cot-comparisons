We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-pop fandom, specifically her extreme fangirling towards Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy seems okay with her fangirling up until the point where she says she would go to a concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The user's question is whether he was wrong to break up.\n\nKey factors here are the girlfriend's behavior. She's been fangirling a lot, which he's noticed but tolerated. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert despite his serious illness. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho before breaking up. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole (AITA). To determine if he's in the wrong, I should assess both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's response might have been a misunderstanding. She could have interpreted the hypothetical question as hypothetical and not a real scenario. Her response might have been an honest answer to the hypothetical, not meaning to prioritize the concert over the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy reacted strongly by calling her a psycho and breaking up. His reaction might be considered over the top, especially since he's been okay with her fangirling before. The breakup was immediate and harsh. However, her answer could have been a deal-breaker for him if he felt it showed a lack of commitment or prioritization of her fandom over the relationship.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's answer was a hypothetical and not meant to be taken seriously, then the guy overreacted. However, if the answer genuinely showed her indifference to his well-being, then the guy's reaction is justified. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. In relationships, partners often have different interests and hobbies. However, when one's hobby starts to impact the relationship dynamics, especially in a way that feels neglected, it's a red flag. But in this case, the issue was a hypothetical scenario. \n\nThe girl's response was a hypothetical answer, but the guy took it as a serious commitment. The way he handled it by breaking up immediately might be seen as too harsh. However, if he felt that her answer indicated she would prioritize her fandom over him in a real crisis, then his reaction is understandable. \n\nBut given that the situation was a hypothetical and not a real issue, the guy's reaction might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might not have meant to prioritize the concert over her partner's health; it's a hypothetical scenario. Therefore, the guy's immediate breakup might be the wrong move. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he overreacted to a hypothetical and ended the relationship without proper communication. However, others might argue that her answer was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nBut in most cases, AITA threads like this usually consider the person who broke up without clear prior discussion as the asshole. Unless there's a pattern of behavior, a single hypothetical answer might not justify such a reaction. So, likely A.\n"
