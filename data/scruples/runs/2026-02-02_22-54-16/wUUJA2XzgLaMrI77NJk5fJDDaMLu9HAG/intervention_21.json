We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They'd been dating seriously for over a month.\n\nFirst, he mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But when he asked hypothetically if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, she said she wouldn't lie and confirmed she'd go. That's when he called her a psycho and broke up. \n\nHmm. So the key point here is the hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. He's asking if she'd still go to the concert, expecting maybe a different answer that shows she'd prioritize their relationship. But she's honest, which he didn't expect. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and mutual respect. He brought up a hypothetical to test her reaction. Maybe he felt that her commitment to this idol was more important than their relationship, especially in a serious situation. But he's only 18, and it's a new relationship. Breaking up based on this might be hasty. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's being completely honest and he can't accept that, maybe it's a dealbreaker for him. But is that fair? Her love for an idol might not translate to real-life commitment issues. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014could be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlso, considering that they've only been dating a month, maybe it's too early to end things over this. But if this was a red flag he couldn't handle, maybe it's valid. But is he wrong for ending it? The question is whether he's the asshole. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether his reaction was proportionate. He admitted he was okay with the tattoo and other aspects, but not her response to the hypothetical. But the hypothetical is extreme\u2014hospital situation. If she's not willing to lie and says she'd still go, maybe he expected her to put their relationship first even in a crisis. However, her response is honest, and he may have not communicated his expectations. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes dealing with each other's passions is part of it. But if one's passion is affecting the relationship's priority, that's a problem. However, in this case, the hypothetical is a test, and her answer is a dealbreaker for him. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong because he had the right to feel that her priorities were misplaced, especially in a critical situation. But the way he handled it\u2014calling her names and breaking up immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. However, the community might have mixed reactions. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he acted on his feelings and communicated his breaking point, maybe he's not wrong. But some might argue it's too early to decide.\n"
