We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. The key here is to analyze the situation from both sides. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he tried to be understanding of her K-Pop interest, even though he doesn't care for it. He points out specific behaviors like her fangirling, liking every Instagram post, and planning a tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. That seems extreme. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she was serious about going regardless of his health. The author felt heartbroken and ended the relationship. Now, the question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nI need to consider if this situation fits into a typical \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario. In these cases, the community often looks at whether the action was a reasonable response to a problem that wasn't addressed earlier. The author had been trying to be patient, but the final straw was her prioritizing a celebrity over a partner's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted. Maybe the girlfriend's response was a hypothetical scenario that wasn't meant to be taken seriously. However, the author says he confirmed she was completely serious. That's a red flag for many people in a relationship. Trust and commitment are important, and if one partner would prioritize a celebrity over the other in a serious situation, that's a dealbreaker for some. \n\nThe tattoo and fangirling alone might not have been dealbreakers, but the final response showed a lack of empathy or consideration in a hypothetical crisis. The author felt that this indicated a lack of commitment to the relationship. \n\nI should also consider if there were any miscommunications. Did the author address his concerns before this incident? It sounds like he had been tolerating her behavior but didn't confront it until now. However, the final action seems to be the catalyst. \n\nIn many AITA situations, the person who leaves is often seen as justified if the other's behavior is extreme. Here, the girlfriend's hypothetical response to not go to the concert despite the partner being in the hospital is a significant issue. That's often seen as a dealbreaker because it shows a lack of prioritizing the partner's well-being. \n\nTherefore, the author's decision to break up might be seen as justified. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
