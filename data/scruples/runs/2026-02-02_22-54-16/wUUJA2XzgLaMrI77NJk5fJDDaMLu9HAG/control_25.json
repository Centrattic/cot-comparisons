We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she's super into K-Pop, especially this artist Jung Yong Hwa. He says he's okay with her liking him a lot, including wanting a tattoo, but when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he (the guy) was in the hospital, he got upset and broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy was okay with her fangirling before, but her response to the hypothetical scenario about him being in the hospital was the last straw. She was completely serious when she said she wouldn't lie about going to the concert despite that. The question is whether he was in the wrong for breaking up over this.\n\nSo, from the guy's perspective, maybe he felt disrespected or unimportant compared to her idol. But on the other hand, she was being honest, which is fair. However, breaking up over this seems extreme. The scenario was a hypothetical, and maybe he was testing her loyalty? But that's a weird way to test it. If that's the case, maybe he was being manipulative. Alternatively, maybe he just couldn't handle the thought of her prioritizing the idol over their relationship in such an extreme way. But she was being honest, and maybe he needed to address this earlier.\n\nBut breaking up over one answer to a hypothetical question seems a bit hasty. Relationships require communication and resolving issues, not just breaking up when something is said that's uncomfortable. Also, her being honest might not be a negative thing. However, if he felt that her fangirling was overshadowing their relationship and he was unhappy, maybe this was a breaking point. Still, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off the relationship immediately\u2014might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut maybe he's right to prioritize his feelings here. If he can't accept her interests, maybe it's not a sustainable relationship. The problem is whether the breaking up was an asshole move. He might have been justified, but the way he did it could be part of the issue. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the method of breaking up. If she was being honest and he just couldn't handle it, maybe he's not the asshole because he's standing up for his feelings. But if this was a minor issue and he's blowing it out of proportion, then he's the asshole. \n\nI think it's a close call, but since he had been okay with her fangirling before and this was a hypothetical, breaking up because she was honest might be too extreme. Therefore, he might be the asshole for overreacting.\n"
