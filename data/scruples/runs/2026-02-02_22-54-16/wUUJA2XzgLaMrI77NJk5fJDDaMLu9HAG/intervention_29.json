We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom, specifically her obsession with Jung Yong Hwa. The key point seems to be her response when he asked if she'd go to the concert even if he were in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy says he's okay with her liking K-Pop, the fangirling, the tattoo, etc. But her answer about going to the concert even if he were seriously ill was the breaking point. He felt heartbroken and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe he felt that her response showed a lack of consideration for him. If she's willing to prioritize this idol over her partner's well-being, that could be a deal-breaker. But maybe her perspective is that she was just being honest and he overreacted. She might not have realized how much that comment would hurt him.\n\nThe girlfriend's answer was that she wouldn't lie, implying she would go regardless. But in a serious relationship, partners usually expect each other to prioritize their well-being. If she's not willing to consider that, it might indicate a fundamental mismatch in values.\n\nBut wait, the author had asked a hypothetical scenario. Sometimes people respond to hypotheticals without fully considering the emotional weight. She might not have intended to hurt him, but her answer did show that her commitment to the idol surpasses her commitment to him in that scenario. That could be a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, is it fair for the author to break up over one hypothetical question? Maybe the relationship had underlying issues. The author mentioned that she's not very complimentary towards him and fangirls more over the idol. Even if he tried to be understanding, maybe he felt neglected or insecure. The tattoo and her dedication to saving for the concert might have been signs of her deep commitment to the idol, which he found problematic.\n\nBut the actual breaking point was her answer to the hypothetical. If he directly asked and she was honest, maybe he's just realizing that their priorities are incompatible. If he can't accept her love for the idol even in that extreme scenario, then maybe ending the relationship is his right. However, is it his fault for overreacting?\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might be seen as extreme, but if her answer confirmed his concerns about her loyalty, then he's not entirely wrong. The key is whether her answer was a reasonable thing to say. If she was being honest and he couldn't handle that, maybe the problem was his expectations. But relationships require communication and boundaries. If he felt this was a deal-breaker, he's not in the wrong for ending it. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
