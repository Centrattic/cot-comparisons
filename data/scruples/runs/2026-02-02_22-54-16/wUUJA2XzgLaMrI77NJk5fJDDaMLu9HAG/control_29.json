We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The question is whether his actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the setup: They've been dating seriously for a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop, but tries to be supportive. The girl is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly, saving up for a tattoo, and liking all his social media posts. The issue arises when she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital. The guy takes this as a sign that she doesn't prioritize their relationship, leading him to break up.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The girl's response was about not lying, which implies she was being honest in her answer. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The girl's actions (fangirling, tattoo, etc.) were part of her hobbies, which he had tolerated. However, the breaking point was her hypothetical statement. \n\nBut here's the thing: The question is whether her hypothetical scenario is a deal-breaker. The scenario is hypothetical, and she's being honest about her feelings toward her idol. However, the boyfriend interpreted it as her valuing the idol more than him. But in a relationship, especially one that's serious, partners are expected to consider each other's feelings. If the boyfriend felt that her hypothetical answer indicated a lack of commitment, then perhaps he overreacted. On the other hand, if the girl was being completely honest and the boyfriend couldn't accept that, maybe the breakup was justified.\n\nHowever, the key is that the girl was honest, and the boyfriend took it as a betrayal. The question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. The answer depends on whether his reaction was proportionate. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario where she's not lying but just expressing her feelings might be seen as overreacting. However, if her actions (tattoo, constant fangirling) were already a source of discomfort and this was the final straw, maybe not.\n\nBut the main issue here is that the boyfriend decided to end the relationship based on a hypothetical question. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate and work through such issues. If he felt uncomfortable with her idolizing someone else that much, maybe he should have addressed it earlier rather than using a hypothetical to test her. Her answer was honest, and his reaction was immediate and harsh. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he had a breaking point, but his reaction of calling her a psycho is problematic. However, the core of the question is whether he's in the wrong for the breakup itself.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. But considering that the girl was honest and he couldn't handle the hypothetical answer, perhaps he overreacted. However, if he felt her priorities were misplaced, then his action is understandable. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but the options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not). Given the situation, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. The girl's answer, while honest, didn't consider the boyfriend's feelings, and the breakup was his way of ending the relationship when he felt disrespected.\n"
