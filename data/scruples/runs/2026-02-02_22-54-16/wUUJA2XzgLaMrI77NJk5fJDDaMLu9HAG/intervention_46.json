We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author breaks up with his girlfriend because she's extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key issue seems to be when the girlfriend says she would go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. The author is upset by her answer and breaks up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has been fangirling a lot about this K-Pop artist, even though she hasn't met him. The author says he's okay with the tattoo and other things, but this specific response about going to the concert despite him being in the hospital is the breaking point.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up over this. Let's think about expectations in a relationship. Trust and commitment are important. If the girlfriend's love for this artist is something she's open about, maybe the author should have discussed his feelings about it before this situation arose. However, the specific scenario where she's willing to prioritize the concert over his well-being is a big red flag. That could indicate a lack of prioritizing the relationship and partner's needs. The author might feel that this response shows she wouldn't support him in a critical moment, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as a personal passion, and the author might not have addressed his discomfort earlier. But the line is crossed when her commitment to her idol seems to override her commitment to the relationship. The author breaking up because he feels heartbroken after this revelation might be justified if he felt this was a dealbreaker.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether prioritizing the concert in such a hypothetical scenario is acceptable. From the author's perspective, it's a huge issue because it shows she wouldn't support him in a time of need. The girlfriend might not have realized how much this would hurt him. But the author's reaction is a choice to end the relationship, which he's allowed to do if he feels his needs aren't met. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But I need to check if there's a different angle. Did the author communicate his feelings beforehand? The text says he tried to pay attention, but maybe he didn't address the fangirling in a way that made her understand his feelings. However, the breaking point was a direct hypothetical. In that case, the author's decision to end things because he felt she wouldn't support him might be justified. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
