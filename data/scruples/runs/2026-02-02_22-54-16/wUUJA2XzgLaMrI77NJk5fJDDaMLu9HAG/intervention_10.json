We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story about breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy and his girlfriend have been dating for over a month. He's not a fan of K-Pop but tries to be supportive. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, going as far as saving for a tattoo of his name. He's okay with most of it, but when she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital, he breaks up with her. He says he's heartbroken and calls her a psycho.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nHe mentions that he's okay with her liking the artist a lot, even the tattoo. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert despite his serious illness. His reaction was to break up, seeing her as a \"psycho.\"\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy had expressed discomfort before? The story doesn't say he had talked to her about his feelings regarding her obsession earlier. Maybe he felt that her commitment to the K-Pop idol was more important than her actual partner. That might be a deal-breaker for him. But is it fair to break up over that? Well, he's allowed to have boundaries. If her actions made him feel less valued, then his reaction could be justified from his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of letting it build up. If he hadn't communicated his discomfort before, maybe he's partly at fault for not addressing it sooner. But the situation is that the final straw was her response to a hypothetical scenario. She was being honest, even if it hurt him. Honesty is important, but so is mutual respect. If her love for the idol is so extreme that it overrides her relationship, that could be a problem. However, he might have overreacted by breaking up immediately without trying to work through it.\n\nBut considering that he was the one to end it, and he felt heartbroken, maybe he's not in the wrong. The question is whether he had a valid reason. If her priorities were clearly not aligned with his, and this was a sign of deeper issues, then he's not wrong to break up. Alternatively, if he didn't give her a chance to explain or change, maybe he is. But the story doesn't mention any prior attempts to talk about it. \n\nAlso, the tattoo and fangirling might be red flags. He was okay with that, but the hypothetical scenario showed a lack of consideration (from her perspective) or maybe she didn't realize the implications. She might not have meant to hurt him, but her answer was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIn relationships, people have different deal-breakers. If her actions made him feel insecure or unimportant, it's reasonable for him to leave. So, in this case, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's acting based on his feelings and boundaries. However, some might argue he should have communicated better first. But since the final incident was a direct trigger and he felt it was a sign of her true feelings, it's plausible he's justified.\n"
