We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom. The main issue here is that the girlfriend was a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, and when the author asked if she would still go to his concert if he (the author) was in the hospital, she said she would go regardless. That's what led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for over a month. The author mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. The breaking point was her response to a hypothetical situation where he's severely ill. Her answer being that she would still go to the concert makes him break up with her. \n\nNow, am I supposed to evaluate if he overreacted? On one hand, the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. If she would prioritize a concert over a partner in the hospital, that's a significant red flag. But then again, it's a hypothetical scenario. The author's reaction was to call her a psycho and end the relationship immediately. That's pretty harsh. \n\nBut let's think: how long have they been together? A month. Maybe not long enough to fully understand each other's values. However, the girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of prioritizing the relationship in a hypothetical crisis. The author felt that this was a dealbreaker. \n\nIn relationships, communication and values are key. If one person's priorities are completely at odds with what the other considers important, that can lead to issues. The author's breaking up might be justified if he felt that her loyalty and presence were non-negotiables. On the other side, maybe he was too quick to jump to conclusions based on a hypothetical. But the girlfriend's response was a clear indication of where her loyalties lie. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's answer was a dealbreaker, and he acted on it, maybe he's justified. But if he overreacted, then he's the asshole. However, considering that he's 18 and in a new relationship, perhaps he's right to set boundaries. Her willingness to abandon a partner in the hospital is a major issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's response was a dealbreaker, and he had the right to end the relationship. But some might argue that the scenario is hypothetical and he's overreacting. But given that he was already okay with the tattoo and fangirling, the final straw was her prioritizing the concert over his health. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
