We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fan obsession is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's extreme fangirling, the specific incident with the concert, and the breakup that followed.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she's a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly, liking every post, saving for a tattoo, and planning a concert trip. The user mentions he's okay with all of that except for her final answer. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. \n\nThe user's reaction was to call her a psycho and end the relationship. Now, the question is if he's the asshole here. \n\nLooking at the factors: The girlfriend's behavior is intense but not illegal or physically harmful. She's expressing her fandom, which is a personal interest. The user tolerated her fangirling except for this one instance. The hypothetical scenario about the hospital is a test of loyalty, and her answer made him feel disrespected or unimportant. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and emotional needs are crucial. If one partner's interests make the other feel neglected or unappreciated, that's a red flag. However, the girlfriend's response in the hypothetical was honest, even if it hurt. The user's reaction was immediate and harsh\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up. That seems extreme, but maybe he felt it was necessary after building up frustration.\n\nAnother angle: the user might feel that her level of devotion to a stranger (since she hasn't met him) is unfair, especially if he's not into K-Pop. But the right to have personal preferences is mutual. The problem is when it affects the relationship's balance. \n\nIs breaking up over this justified? It depends on how much this affected their relationship. If the user felt consistently devalued or neglected, maybe it's valid. But the breaking point was a single hypothetical question. Her answer, while hurtful, is a statement of her feelings, not an action. Reacting with such intensity might come off as overreacting, but if it's the culmination of ongoing issues, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn terms of right/wrong, relationships are subjective. However, the user's immediate breakup and name-calling could be seen as the asshole move because it's a harsh reaction. The girlfriend's honesty, while hurtful, is not a crime. The user might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue earlier or for reacting so strongly. Alternatively, he might feel justified if this was the final straw after many small issues.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the reaction was extreme, and there might have been a lack of communication before the breakup. However, others might argue B if the fandom was a deal-breaker for him all along.\n"
