We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point here is the girlfriend's response when the author asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie, implying she would still go.\n\nSo, the author found that response heartbreakingly serious and broke up. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, her fangirling is extreme, and maybe the author felt neglected or unimportant compared to this idol she's never met. On the other hand, the breakup was over a hypothetical scenario. Did she actually say she'd choose the concert over him? Maybe she was being honest but not intending to hurt him. \n\nFactors to consider: The author tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. But the response to the hospital question was the breaking point. The girlfriend's behavior shows deep emotional investment in someone she's never met, which could indicate a red flag. However, maybe she was just being honest about her feelings without meaning to hurt. The author's reaction was immediate and severe\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up. That might be a harsh reaction, but if he felt disrespected or replaced by an idol, it's a valid reason. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had discussed his feelings earlier, maybe the situation could have been resolved. But the girlfriend's response to the hypothetical situation might have been the final straw. The author might be justified if he felt his partner's loyalty or commitment was questionable. Alternatively, using a hypothetical might not reflect real-life actions. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. He had tried to accept her K-Pop interest but couldn't handle the hypothetical scenario. Since he left after that, and she didn't back down, he might not be in the wrong. However, others might argue that he should have communicated more before breaking up. But given the situation, he's allowed to set boundaries. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
