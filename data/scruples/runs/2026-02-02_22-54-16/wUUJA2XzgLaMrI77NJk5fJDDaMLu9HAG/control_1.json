We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo.

Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, an 18-year-old guy, broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month. He mentions that he tries to pay attention to her interests even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. His girlfriend is very enthusiastic about the artist, to the point of saving money for a tattoo and liking every social media post. But what really set him off was when she said she would go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He reacted strongly, called her a psycho, and ended the relationship. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior towards her idol. Fandom can be intense, especially with K-Pop, but the key here is her level of devotion compared to her relationship with the author. He says she's not very complimentary towards him, but when talking about Jung Yong Hwa, she's overly enthusiastic. The tattoo and saving money for a concert are significant commitments. But the breaking point was her response to the hypothetical scenario of him being in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie, meaning she would still go to the concert even if he was seriously ill. \n\nNow, the author's perspective is that this shows her prioritizing the idol over their relationship, which hurt him. He felt heartbroken and ended the relationship. But was that a justified reaction?\n\nIn relationships, especially in the early stages, communication is key. The author mentions that he's okay with her interests, including the tattoo. The problem arises when her hypothetical response felt like she would put her idol above him in a critical situation. However, it's important to consider the context of a one-month relationship. At that point, they might not have established deep trust or long-term commitments. The girlfriend's hypothetical answer might not reflect her actual feelings in a real situation, but the author took it as a sign of her priorities. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how much this would hurt him. She might view her fandom as a personal interest that doesn't interfere with their relationship. Her response, while extreme, could be seen as a dramatic hypothetical, not a real-life commitment. However, to the author, it felt like a deal-breaker because it showed where her loyalty stands.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. Ending a one-month relationship over this might seem harsh, but if this was a deal-breaker for him, he might have a right to end it. However, calling her a psycho is unkind and could be seen as an overreaction. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might be in the wrong if he didn't address the issue earlier or if his reaction was too harsh. However, if this was a clear red flag for him and he felt unable to continue the relationship, then he might not be the asshole. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The hypothetical question and her answer might have exposed a fundamental incompatibility, but the way he ended it (calling her a psycho) is unkind. \n\nBut in the AITA context, people often consider whether the action was justified. The author's justification is his emotional response, but the severity of the breakup and the harsh language might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if her behavior was a deal-breaker, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: in a one-month relationship, maybe the author didn't give it enough time to work through issues. However, the situation presented a clear value clash. The girlfriend's hypothetical answer could indicate that her dedication to the idol is more important than the relationship in a crisis. If that's something the author can't accept, ending the relationship is a choice. \n\nBut the way he ended it (calling her a psycho) is problematic. The question is whether the action (breaking up) was right regardless of the method. Since he felt heartbroken, maybe the breakup was justified, but the harsh words add to the problem.\n\nSo, in AITA terms, the answer often depends on whether the person acted with consideration and whether their actions were proportionate. The author's reaction may be seen as disproportionate to the situation, especially since it was a hypothetical. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. The community might split, but the key is the harsh language and the reason for the breakup. In the end, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he had the right to end the relationship if her priorities were a problem for him, but the way he did it is questionable. However, in AITA, the focus is more on the action rather than the method. So the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because he ended the relationship based on his deal-breaker, even if the method was harsh. Alternatively, some might say A because he overreacted. But I think the main issue is whether he had the right to break up, and if the reason is valid, then B. If the reason is not valid, then A. Given that the hypothetical scenario revealed a potential incompatibility in values (prioritizing idol over partner in a crisis), it might be seen as a valid reason, making the answer B.\n"
