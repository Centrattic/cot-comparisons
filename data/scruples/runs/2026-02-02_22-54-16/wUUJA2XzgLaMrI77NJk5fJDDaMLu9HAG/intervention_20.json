We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month. He says he tries to be understanding, but her constant fangirling is bothering him. The tipping point was when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's 18, she's 18. They've been dating for a month. In a new relationship, sometimes people might have issues with each other's passions. K-Pop can be a big deal, especially if someone is a die-hard fan. But the problem here seems to be her devotion to the artist to the point where she's more focused on him than her partner. She's saving for a tattoo, likes everything online, and even if her boyfriend is in the hospital, she would still go to the concert. That seems extreme.\n\nHe mentioned that he was okay with the tattoo and other things, but her response to the hypothetical situation was a dealbreaker. The key question is whether her answer was unreasonable. He asked, \"What if I was in the hospital?\" and her answer was that she would still go. That suggests her loyalty wasn't with him, which might be a big red flag for him. \n\nIs he overreacting? Breaking up after a month because of this could be seen as hasty. But on the other hand, if her answer showed that she wouldn't prioritize his well-being over her fandom, maybe he's justified. Fandom can take up a lot of time and emotional investment, which might lead to commitment issues in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. Maybe he should have tried to talk it out more, but the situation did make him heartbroken. The community might have mixed reactions. Some might say he's right to leave if her devotion is more important than the relationship, others might say he's being too quick to judge.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me weigh the factors. Extreme fandom where the partner's needs are ignored could be a valid reason. If her answer showed she couldn't prioritize him in a crisis, that's a significant issue. However, maybe the scenario is hypothetical, and she might not act that way in reality. But her immediate and serious response made him feel she was being disloyal. \n\nIn the end, the decision to break up is personal. If her actions and values don't align with his, he's not in the wrong for ending it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
