We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The scenario is that he was okay with her fangirling before, but when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he broke it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's extreme love for Jung Yong Hwa includes fangirling, liking all his posts, saving for a tattoo, and wanting to go to his concert in Korea. The breaking point was when she didn't express any hesitation about going even if he was seriously ill.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions show a deep emotional attachment to a celebrity she hasn't met. Her response about not lying when asked about his hospitalization could be seen as a lack of empathy or commitment to the relationship. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, and if she's prioritizing a celebrity over her partner's well-being, that's a red flag. The author might feel that her response indicated she wouldn't support him in a time of need, which is a significant issue in a serious relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was being honest without intending to hurt. She might see her fandom as just a passion and not realizing how it affects the relationship. However, the decision to go to the concert despite his illness shows a potential lack of prioritization in the relationship. The author's reaction was immediate, calling her a psycho and breaking up, which is a strong response. Was that justified? If he felt that her priorities were misplaced and that she wouldn't support him in a serious situation, then ending the relationship might be his way of protecting himself from future hurt. \n\nBut was he in the wrong for breaking up? It's possible that he could have discussed his feelings instead of reacting so harshly. However, the situation was a dealbreaker for him. If her response indicated that she wouldn't be there for him in a critical moment, ending the relationship could be a valid choice. So, the answer might be B (No), because he's acting on his values and what he's comfortable with in a relationship. The key is whether her actions were a dealbreaker, and if he's allowed to set that boundary.\n"
