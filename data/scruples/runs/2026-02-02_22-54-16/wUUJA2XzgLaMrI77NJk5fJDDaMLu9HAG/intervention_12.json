We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe guy is 18, and the relationship has been going on for a month. He's okay with her loving K-Pop and even her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions that she's not very complimentary towards him, but when she talks about this artist, she's super enthusiastic. He's okay with the tattoo and all that. The breaking point is when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He thought she was just playing along with his hypotheticals, but she was serious. That made him break up with her.\n\nHmm. So the key issue here is her prioritizing her obsession over her partner in a hypothetical serious situation. The author feels hurt and doesn't understand how she could be so committed to someone she's never met, while being okay with a hypothetical scenario where her partner is very ill. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. He tried to be playful with hypotheticals, but when she took it seriously, it caused a break-up. But was breaking up the right reaction? Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If her behavior made him feel unappreciated or not valued, then maybe his reaction is valid. However, maybe he should have talked about his feelings earlier instead of breaking up after one conversation.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe he's overreacting. K-Pop is a big passion for many people, and maybe she's just really into it. But the fact that she was completely serious about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital is a problem. That suggests that her loyalty or commitment in a real crisis isn't to her partner. If a relationship can't survive that, maybe breaking up is the right call.\n\nAlso, considering the relationship's length. They've been dating for a month. Sometimes people break up quickly if there are fundamental differences. But others might work it out. The author is heartbroken, which shows he's not just being impulsive but genuinely hurt.\n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but others might argue he should have communicated his feelings earlier. However, the situation where a partner is willing to abandon their sick partner to attend a concert is a deal-breaker for some. So maybe he's justified in breaking up.\n\nOn the other hand, if he had talked about his feelings about her K-Pop obsession before, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But he says he's okay with the tattoo and the fangirling. It's the hypothetical scenario that's the problem. So in that specific moment, her answer was the final straw.\n\nI think the key here is that the author felt disrespected and unimportant compared to her obsession. If a partner isn't willing to prioritize their significant other in a crisis, that's a major red flag. So breaking up over that isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
