We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he broke up with his girlfriend because she was extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They were dating for over a month. He mentions that he didn't care for K-Pop but tried to be supportive. The problem came when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign she doesn't prioritize him and called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's extreme fangirling might be a dealbreaker for him. But maybe it's just a personal preference. He was okay with the tattoo and her liking him a lot, but the concert comment was the last straw. The key issue here is whether her statement about going to the concert despite his hospitalization was a valid reason to break up.\n\nHe asked a hypothetical question to test her, and she answered honestly. If she's honest about her feelings, maybe she just has a strong passion for K-Pop that he can't accept. But is it reasonable to end a relationship over that? It depends on how important the issue is to the guy. If her devotion to a celebrity he doesn't like is causing him emotional pain and he feels disrespected, maybe he's justified. But others might think that her actions are just a personal hobby and not a fair reason to end the relationship. The fact that she didn't lie and was honest could mean that she's just being truthful, but he might see it as not valuing their relationship. Since the relationship is only a month old, maybe it's a red flag he realized too late. But breaking up because of this might be harsh. The answer isn't straightforward. I need to weigh the facts. The author says he's okay with all the other stuff, so the final straw was her honesty. So maybe he's not wrong if he felt it was a dealbreaker. But some might argue he overreacted. But given the context, he's allowed to end the relationship if this is a dealbreaker for him. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
