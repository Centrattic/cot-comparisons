We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who's 18, and he's been dating his girlfriend for over a month. She's really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He's trying to be attentive, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. He mentions she's not very complimentary towards him, but when talking about Jung Yong Hwa, she's super enthusiastic, listing his talents and such. She's saving money for a tattoo of his name and likes all his Instagram posts. The author is okay with all that. The breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He made up scenarios, including the hospital one, and when he asked that, she said she'd still go. He was heartbroken and broke up with her. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the key points. The issue here is her commitment to her fandom versus their relationship. The author felt that her prioritization of the K-Pop idol over their relationship was a deal-breaker. But was that a reasonable reaction?\n\nRelationships require mutual respect and understanding. If one partner's interests are causing the other to feel neglected or unvalued, that's a problem. However, the author's response was to break up immediately after the hospital question. Was that an overreaction?\n\nHer response was that she wouldn't lie. That suggests she was honest but perhaps didn't realize how that honesty would affect him. She didn't say she preferred the idol over him, just that she would go regardless of his situation. Maybe she didn't mean to be dismissive, but it came across as such.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call her a \"psycho\" and end things. That's pretty harsh. Even if he was hurt, calling someone a name and breaking up in the moment might not be the best approach. However, the content of her response is what led to the breakup. The core issue is whether her answer was unreasonable.\n\nBut let's consider the context. The relationship is only a month old, which isn't a long time. Maybe the author felt that this was a red flag, but maybe he overreacted. On the other hand, if he felt his well-being was being compromised and her priorities were not aligned with his, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be extreme. Also, she might not have intended to hurt him, just being honest about her feelings towards the idol.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the author express his feelings about her fangirling before? If he's been okay with all the other stuff but this was the breaking point, maybe it's about cumulative feelings. But the hospital scenario is a hypothetical that's designed to test loyalty. Maybe he should have handled it with more patience or discussed his feelings instead of using a hypothetical to provoke a reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if she was honest and he felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe it's not the wrong. However, the immediate breakup and harsh language might make him the asshole. Conversely, if her answer showed a lack of empathy or consideration, then he's justified.\n\nI think this is a tricky one. The answer hinges on whether her response was unreasonable. If she was being honest but not intentionally dismissive, maybe the author overreacted. But if her answer indicated that her commitment to the idol was more important than the relationship, then the author's reaction is valid. However, breaking up over a hypothetical might be hasty. The key is the balance between respecting each other's boundaries and the way the conflict was handled. The author's harsh words and immediate breakup could be seen as in the wrong, but if he felt this was a non-negotiable issue, maybe not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because her response was a deal-breaker for him, though the manner of the breakup could be improved. However, the initial question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the manner. The core issue is the breakup reason. So if her answer was a deal-breaker, then it's not his fault. But maybe the way he handled it was wrong. The question is if he's in the wrong for breaking up. If the reason is valid, then no. If the reason is not valid, then yes. The validity depends on whether her answer was unacceptable. Since she was honest about her commitment to the idol, even in hypothetical scenarios, and he found that unacceptable, maybe it's not his fault. So answer B.\n"
