We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of wanting a tattoo and wanting to go to his concert in Korea. The breaking point was when the guy asked her if she'd still go if he was in the hospital, and she said yes without hesitation. He then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy says he tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. The issue was her response to the hypothetical scenario. The key here is whether her answer was a dealbreaker. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, which seems pretty harsh. \n\nBut why did he feel that way? It's possible he felt disrespected or devalued. If she wouldn't prioritize his health over her K-Pop idol, that could indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. However, the scenario is a hypothetical, so maybe she didn't take it seriously. On the other hand, her not hesitating might have made him realize that her passion for the artist is so intense that it could conflict with their relationship's priorities.\n\nIs it fair to break up over that? Well, if a core value for him is that his partner would prioritize him over other interests, then her answer might have shown a misalignment. However, breaking up immediately after that might be a hasty reaction. The guy might have been in the wrong if he didn't address the issue earlier or if his reaction was disproportionate. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. K-Pop fandom is a personal issue; unless it's affecting the relationship in concrete ways (like neglecting time together), it's a matter of personal preference. However, her response to the hypothetical might indicate that she values the artist more than their relationship in a crisis, which could be a valid concern. \n\nThe girl's answer was honest, and maybe the guy needed to confront her about it earlier. If he's just now realizing this issue after a month, maybe he didn't communicate his feelings properly. But if this was a long-standing concern, then maybe he's justified. The key is whether the breakup was a mature decision or an overreaction. The guy's immediate reaction was to call her a psycho, which is harsh, but the breakup decision might be his right if he feels disrespected. \n\nIn terms of AITA standards, people often aren't in the wrong if they end a relationship due to incompatibility. However, the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) might be problematic. So there's a balance here. The answer would depend on whether her actions were genuinely harmful or just a difference in values. Since she's never met the artist and it's a personal passion, unless it's affecting their relationship beyond this hypothetical, maybe the guy is being too harsh. However, the hypothetical scenario he presented is a test of her commitment, and her answer led to his decision. \n\nIn many AITA cases, people aren't in the wrong for ending a relationship if they feel their values are incompatible. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the immediate and harsh reaction could be a point against him. But given the context, he's allowed to set boundaries. So likely B.\n"
