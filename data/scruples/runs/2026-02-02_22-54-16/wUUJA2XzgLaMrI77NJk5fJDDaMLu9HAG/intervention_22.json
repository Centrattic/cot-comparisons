We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom. The situation revolves around her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa to a point that he found unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship had been going on for over a month, and the author mentions that he tried to be understanding and even okay with the tattoo. The breaking point was her statement that she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. This response made him feel heartbroken, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, evaluating the key points: The girlfriend's behavior is fangirling, which is common, but the level of devotion and the hypothetical scenario where her commitment to the artist overshadows a serious personal crisis in the relationship is the crux. The author felt disrespected and devalued, which is a valid emotional response. However, breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be seen as overreacting by some. \n\nBut considering that he had already tried to be understanding and the final straw was her unwillingness to prioritize the relationship in a critical moment, even if hypothetical, his reaction isn't entirely unjustified. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the core issue is about her being more committed to a celebrity she hasn't met than her partner, and he felt it was a deal-breaker, then his decision isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the hypothetical scenario is extreme and not a real commitment. But in relationships, how partners handle such situations can be significant. The author's actions are a result of feeling unappreciated and devalued, which is a common reason for breakups. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong here. He made a tough decision but based on his values and emotional needs at that time.\n"
