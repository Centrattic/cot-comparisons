We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup caused by the girlfriend's extreme love for a K-Pop artist, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The author, who is 18, had been in a serious relationship for over a month. He's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo part, but the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he (the author) was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overreacted. The key moment was when he asked, \"What if I was in the hospital? Would you still go?\" Her response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she would still go. The author then broke up with her, thinking she was a \"psycho.\" \n\nSo, does her answer justify the breakup? The author claims he's okay with the fangirling before, but this specific scenario was a dealbreaker. The question is whether her answer was unreasonable. \n\nFrom his perspective, if someone is in a relationship and the partner prioritizes a celebrity over their significant other in a critical situation (like being in the hospital), that could be a red flag. The author might feel that loyalty and emotional support in a relationship are important, and her willingness to prioritize the concert over his well-being is a sign of imbalance.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective might be that her love for the K-Pop artist is just a hobby, and she's not actually going to abandon the author. She might not realize how much this fangirling affects him. But when pushed with an extreme hypothetical, she's honest about her feelings.\n\nIs the author justified in breaking up over this? Well, in a relationship, dealbreakers vary. If fangirling to the point of prioritizing a celebrity over a partner in a crisis is a dealbreaker for the author, then acting on that is his choice. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as abrupt if there wasn't prior discussion about boundaries. But since the author stated he was okay with the tattoo and other aspects, the breaking point was this specific hypothetical. \n\nSome might argue that the hypothetical is extreme and not a realistic scenario. Others might see it as a test of priorities. If the girlfriend was honest in answering, maybe she didn't realize the gravity of her statement. The author might feel that her answer showed a lack of commitment to the relationship, hence the breakup as a justified action.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the situation he's reacting to is a dealbreaker for him, and if he communicated his feelings and felt disrespected or unimportant, then ending the relationship is his right. However, some might say he should have addressed it earlier rather than breaking up over one statement. But since he mentions he was okay with the fangirling before, this specific answer was the last straw, making his reaction understandable.\n"
