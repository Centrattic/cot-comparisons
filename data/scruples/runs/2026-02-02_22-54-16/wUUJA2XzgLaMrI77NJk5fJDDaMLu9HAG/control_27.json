We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is 18, they've been dating over a month. The girl is really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot. The guy says he can handle the fangirling, even the tattoo. But when she says she would go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, he breaks up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is her commitment to her fandom versus their relationship. The girl's response to the hypothetical about him being in the hospital seems extreme. The guy felt heartbroken and cut things off. Now, the question is whether he's the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no (A/B) answer. Let me break down the factors. The relationship is new, only a month. The guy was trying to be understanding, even with her constant fangirling. The breaking point was her not prioritizing him in a hypothetical serious situation. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nIn relationships, trust and emotional connection are key. If one partner's commitment to a fandom seems to overshadow the relationship, that's a red flag. The girl's willingness to go to the concert despite his illness shows she might not prioritize his well-being, which is a big deal. However, it's a hypothetical, so maybe she didn't mean to take it that seriously. But he did take it seriously, which led him to break up.\n\nBut was the guy in the wrong? He had reasons to feel betrayed. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be impulsive. Also, in a month-long relationship, maybe they haven't established enough to handle such a situation. But if this is a dealbreaker for him, he might not be wrong. The girl's actions indicate possible emotional unavailability, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might have overreacted. Maybe he should have talked it out before breaking up. But if this was the final straw after months of fangirling, maybe not. The key is whether the girl's actions were unreasonable. Her prioritizing a celebrity over a real relationship partner is problematic. So the guy might be justified in ending it.\n\nBut is he the asshole? The term \"asshole\" here implies doing something wrong. If breaking up over this is a reasonable decision given her behavior, then he's not in the wrong. But if the reaction was too harsh, then maybe he is. Since the user's scenario presents the girl's actions as crossing a line, the guy's decision might be justified. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
