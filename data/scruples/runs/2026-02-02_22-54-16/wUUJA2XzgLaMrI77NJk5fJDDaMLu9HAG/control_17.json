We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-pop fandom was in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and even saying she would go to his concert in Korea even if her partner was in the hospital. The guy broke up and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy says he tried to be understanding, but her response about going to the concert despite his hospitalization was the breaking point. The question is whether he overreacted or if she was being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, it's possible that the guy felt disrespected or unimportant if her commitment to a K-pop idol could override his well-being. If someone is in the hospital, that's a serious situation, and expecting her to prioritize the idol over a partner might seem extreme. The guy might have felt that her answer showed a lack of care for their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe her K-pop fandom is a significant part of her identity, and she didn't realize how her comment would hurt him. She might not have intended to be dismissive. Sometimes, people in fandoms express their admiration in ways that others might misinterpret. But the key here is her actual commitment. She said \"nothing could keep her\" from going, even in a scenario where her partner is seriously ill. That could be seen as valuing the idol's event more than her partner's health, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the guy broke up immediately after that conversation. Was there communication beforehand? Did he express his feelings about her fangirling before? If he had talked to her about how it made him feel and she didn't adjust, then his reaction might be more justified. But if he never addressed it and this was the first time it came up, maybe he didn't give her a chance to explain or change her behavior.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is the specific response about the hospital. Even if she didn't mean to be cruel, the fact that she was completely serious and didn't lie made him break up. In relationships, trust and mutual respect are important. If a partner's actions or words make you feel unimportant or undervalued, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. However, breaking up over one statement might be a hasty reaction, especially if there were no prior discussions about boundaries.\n\nBut considering the scenario, the guy might have reached a breaking point. The tattoo, the fangirling, and the hospital comment all could contribute to feeling overshadowed. On the flip side, maybe he should have communicated his feelings instead of reacting so abruptly. However, the core issue is the response to the hospital scenario. If the girl's answer showed that she wouldn't prioritize her partner's health, that's a dealbreaker for some people. So, breaking up in that case isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
