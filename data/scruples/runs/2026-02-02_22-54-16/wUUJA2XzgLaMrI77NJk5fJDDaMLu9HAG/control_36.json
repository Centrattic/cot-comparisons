We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. He says he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. She's very fangirling, which he finds a bit annoying, but he's okay with it. The issue comes up when she says she'd go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He's heartbroken and breaks up with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and expectations in a relationship. The girlfriend's level of devotion to her idol is intense\u2014saving up for a tattoo, liking every post, and prioritizing a concert. The guy's breaking point is when she shows no hesitation in prioritizing the idol over him in an extreme scenario. \n\nIs the guy wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If she's not being disrespectful to him and he's been okay with her fandom up to this point, maybe he's overreacting. On the other hand, when someone is in a serious relationship, expecting a partner to prioritize a celebrity over their significant other in a serious scenario (like an illness) could be a deal-breaker. \n\nBut wait, the scenario is hypothetical. He asked a hypothetical question, and she answered honestly. Maybe he's setting unrealistic expectations. However, if her answer reflects her priorities and values, then if he can't accept that, breaking up might be his right. But is he being unreasonable for not accepting her passion as part of who she is?\n\nAlso, considering they've been dating for a month, maybe it's too early to make such a big decision. However, if this was a red flag he had been ignoring before, maybe he's justified. \n\nThe tattoo, saving for a concert, and the fangirling are all things he said he was okay with. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. So maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his feelings earlier. If he hadn't addressed his discomfort with her fandom's intensity, then he's in the wrong for waiting until a hypothetical situation to act. \n\nBut if the hypothetical situation revealed a fundamental incompatibility in their values (prioritizing a celebrity over the partner in a crisis), then maybe he's right to leave. However, in reality, he's making a big assumption based on a hypothetical. People might answer hypothetically in a way they wouldn't act in real life. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The girlfriend isn't disrespectful to him; she's just passionate. The guy's issue is more about her priorities in an extreme scenario. But expecting someone to choose between you and a celebrity in a hypothetical is a stretch. So maybe he's overreacting. However, if her answer shows that she values the celebrity more than him in her mind, even if it's hypothetical, then he's breaking up because he can't accept that. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel valued. If her actions (like the tattoo, fangirling) are making him feel insecure or neglected, maybe he should have addressed that before. But if her answer to the hypothetical is the final straw, it's possible he's right to break up. However, the way he did it\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off suddenly\u2014might be immature. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit of both. But the main question is whether he's the asshole. If he's breaking up because she can't imagine prioritizing him over a celebrity in a hypothetical, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not considering that she might not actually act on that hypothetical, then he's overreacting. \n\nI think the key is that he's reacting to her priorities as revealed through her answer. If he can't accept that, then it's his choice, but he might be the asshole for not addressing issues earlier or for overreacting to a hypothetical.\n"
