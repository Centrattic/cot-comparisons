We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who broke up with his 18-year-old girlfriend because of her extreme K-Pop fandom, specifically about her love for Jung Yong Hwa. They'd been dating seriously for over a month. He mentions he's tried to be understanding, even supporting her tattoo plans and her fangirling. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He found that response heartbroken and ended things.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating a month, which isn't that long, but he says it's serious. The issue isn't just the fangirling but her prioritizing a celebrity over their relationship. However, her response might not be as it seems. When he posed the hypothetical about him being in the hospital, her answer was that she would still go. He took that as her prioritizing a stranger over him, but maybe she didn't mean it that way? Maybe she was testing his hypothetical or didn't take the scenario seriously? But he says she confirmed she was serious. \n\nHe also mentions that she doesn't compliment him much, which might have contributed to his feelings. However, the immediate reaction was breaking up over that one statement. Is that a fair reaction? Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario where someone states their hypothetical actions could be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, if he felt that her commitment to an obsession (a celebrity) over their relationship was a deal-breaker, maybe it's a valid reason.\n\nBut considering that they were only dating for a month, maybe he acted too quickly. Also, she might not have meant it as a rejection but was just being a fan. However, her not lying and being serious about going to the concert despite his hypothetical hospitalization shows a lack of consideration for his feelings. \n\nBut the key here is whether he had the right to break up. He might have felt betrayed or disrespected, but is a hypothetical scenario enough? The question is if he's the asshole. Breaking up because she loves a celebrity a lot isn't necessarily wrong if it's causing him significant distress. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and ending things immediately\u2014might be harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's right because a relationship needs mutual respect and consideration. If she's willing to prioritize a celebrity over their relationship in a hypothetical, that could indicate deeper issues. But then again, it's a hypothetical scenario. Maybe he's overreacting. \n\nAnother angle: her behavior (saving for a tattoo, fangirling) might not be the issue he thought they were, but the breaking point was her not prioritizing him in a hypothetical. It's possible he's justified in ending things if he felt disrespected. But others might see it as him being too controlling or not communicating his feelings properly. \n\nSo, in terms of the answer, the options are A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). The user is asking if he's in the wrong. If his reaction was a reasonable expression of his feelings and boundaries, then B. If he overreacted, then A. \n\nI think the consensus in such situations often leans towards the person ending the relationship if they feel their needs aren't met. However, breaking up over a single hypothetical question could be seen as hasty. But the fact that he felt heartbroken and couldn't handle her stance might be valid. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his boundaries. However, others might argue he's being too quick to judge. But based on the scenario, he was clear about his feelings, and she was clear about hers. If he can't accept that, it's reasonable to part ways. So probably B.\n"
