We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point where she's saving up for a tattoo of his name and would go to a concert in Korea even if her partner was in the hospital. The guy asked hypothetically if she'd go to the concert if he was in the hospital, and she said she would. That's when he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy was okay with her fangirling before, but this specific statement about going to the concert despite him being in the hospital was the breaking point. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship here.\n\nOn one hand, he might feel that her prioritizing a celebrity over a serious relationship is a red flag. If she's willing to leave even in a hypothetical where he's very sick, that could indicate a lack of commitment or emotional support. He might feel disrespected or that his well-being isn't a priority for her. That's a valid feeling, and if someone's actions repeatedly show that their partner's health isn't important, ending the relationship could be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is hypothetical. She was responding to a made-up scenario, which might not reflect real-life actions. People can say things in hypotheticals that they wouldn't act on. Also, her fangirling might be a part of her identity that he's uncomfortable with, but maybe he could have addressed it through communication rather than breaking up. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could be seen as overreacting, especially if there are no prior signs of her actually prioritizing the celebrity over him in real life.\n\nAnother angle is the tattoo and concert savings. The guy said he's okay with the tattoo but the hypothetical was the last straw. Maybe he felt that her dedication to a celebrity was overshadowing their relationship. However, breaking up over a hypothetical could be seen as impulsive if there's no evidence of her actually choosing the celebrity over him in real situations.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If there were previous issues about her fangirling and he didn't address them, maybe he's responsible for not discussing his feelings sooner. Ending the relationship because of a hypothetical might be a sudden reaction without addressing underlying concerns.\n\nBut then again, if her response to the hospital question made him realize that she doesn't value his well-being, it's a deal-breaker for him. Everyone has different boundaries, and if her actions in the hypothetical made him feel insecure, he's within his right to end things. It's a personal choice based on his values.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, it's tricky. The answer could go either way. However, the key here is that he broke up because of a hypothetical scenario. If she hadn't answered that way, maybe they'd still be together. But her answer made him realize a fundamental incompatibility. In that case, he might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his feelings about her fangirling before, he might be partially at fault for not addressing it earlier.\n\nIn many cases, people break up when they feel their needs aren't met. If he felt that her commitment was questionable even in a hypothetical, his reaction is understandable. So, maybe he's not the asshole here. The answer might be B.\n"
