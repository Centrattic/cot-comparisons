We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend being extremely devoted to an artist, even to the point of wanting a tattoo and planning a concert trip. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for over a month, which isn't a long time, but enough for some level of commitment. The guy wasn't against her K-Pop interest initially; he paid attention and accepted things like the tattoo. The issue here is her response when asked a hypothetical scenario about his health. \n\nThe key point is her answer. She didn't lie, which he took as a major deal-breaker. He found out she'd prioritize the concert over his well-being. That's a big red flag about loyalty and emotional support. But is it grounds for breaking up? Well, it's a personal decision. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nMaybe some might argue that his reaction was harsh, especially over a hypothetical. Others might say that her response showed a lack of empathy and consideration. The fact that she was completely serious and unapologetic could be the real issue here. The author felt heartbroken and couldn't handle the thought of that level of commitment to someone else. \n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are crucial. If one partner's actions or responses make the other feel undervalued, that's a problem. Her prioritizing a K-Pop star over her partner's health might be seen as a betrayal of trust. But maybe the author overreacted? However, he tried to be understanding before, so this specific incident was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. His feelings were valid; her response indicated she might not be emotionally available in a crisis. Breaking up because of this shows he set boundaries based on his needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
