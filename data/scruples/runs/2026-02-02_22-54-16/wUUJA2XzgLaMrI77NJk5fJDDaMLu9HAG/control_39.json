We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom, specifically her devotion to Jung Yong Hwa. The situation involves her fangirling a lot, which he's okay with, but her response to his hypothetical scenario about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital really upset him. He ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been dating for over a month, which isn't very long. The girl is a huge fan, but the author had been trying to be understanding. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't hesitate to go to the concert even if he was seriously ill. The author reacted strongly, calling her a psycho and breaking up. \n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The girl's actions, like fangirling and wanting a tattoo, might be seen as extreme, but the author had been okay with those before. The issue here is her response to a personal hypothetical. However, the hypothetical is about his well-being, which is a serious matter. Her not caring if he was in the hospital could indicate a lack of empathy or emotional support, which is a valid concern in a relationship. \n\nBut wait, the hypothetical was a made-up scenario. Maybe he was testing her, which isn't the healthiest approach. However, her response showed that she prioritizes her fandom over his health, which could be a red flag. The author might feel betrayed or unimportant if he believes that in a crisis, she wouldn't support him. On the other hand, reacting by breaking up immediately might be seen as extreme, especially after only a month. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author is the asshole. If the author broke up because her response indicated she doesn't value his well-being, then he's acting to protect himself from a potentially harmful dynamic. However, some might argue that the hypothetical is not a real situation and that her response doesn't necessarily reflect her true feelings in an actual scenario. Others might say that her actions showed a lack of emotional investment in the relationship, making the breakup justified.\n\nConsidering cultural context, K-Pop fandoms can be very passionate, and some people might see it as harmless. But if it's affecting the relationship's balance, it's a valid concern. The author's reaction was immediate and harsh, but if he felt that her response was a deal-breaker, then he's not necessarily wrong. However, there's a chance that the situation was misunderstood or that she didn't take the hypothetical seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a response to a perceived lack of emotional support and prioritization of his health. While the breakup was abrupt, it might be a valid decision based on his values and needs in a relationship. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
