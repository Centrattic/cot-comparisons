We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was in the wrong. Let's start by looking at the details.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating for over a month. He's not into K-Pop but tries to be supportive. His girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, complimenting him non-stop, and even planning a tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital seriously ill. He found out she was completely serious, which made him heartbroken and led him to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if he overreacted. Breaking up because of this seems drastic. The key here is that she was honest about her feelings. If he couldn't accept that her feelings for the K-Pop star were stronger than her feelings for him in a crisis, maybe he had issues with insecurity or jealousy. On the other hand, if he felt that her commitment to a stranger was more important than their relationship, that's a valid concern.\n\nHe tried to be supportive but might have felt neglected or overshadowed. However, her actions and words indicate she's more devoted to this idol than to him. In a healthy relationship, both partners should prioritize each other. If she couldn't do that in a hypothetical critical situation, it's a red flag. But was it right to end it so quickly? Maybe he should have communicated his feelings first instead of reacting with anger and cutting things off.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole. If the core issue is her inability to prioritize their relationship over her K-Pop obsession, then he might be justified. But if he didn't address his feelings and just lashed out, maybe he's in the wrong. However, given the context that she was serious about choosing her idol over him even in a dire situation, his reaction could be seen as a last straw after feeling neglected for a while.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the breakup was a proportional response. Since he tried to be supportive but felt heartbroken and couldn't accept her priorities, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he could have handled it better. However, the question is if he's the asshole. If he was genuinely hurt and couldn't accept her actions, breaking up might be his right. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
