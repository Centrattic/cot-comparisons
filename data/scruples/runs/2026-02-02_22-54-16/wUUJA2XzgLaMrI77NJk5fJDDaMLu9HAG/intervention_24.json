We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because of her extreme love for a K-Pop artist, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is the asshole.\n\nSo, the guy says he's been dating her seriously for over a month. He's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo part. But then she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He reacts strongly and breaks up with her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl's behavior around her idol is intense, but the breaking point was her response to the hypothetical scenario where the guy is seriously sick. She didn't lie and said she would go. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship.\n\nIs it fair for him to break up over this? Well, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Her commitment to attending the concert despite his health could be seen as not prioritizing their relationship. However, maybe the guy's reaction was too harsh. Breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be an overreaction, especially since they've only been dating a month. But on the other hand, if her actions in real life showed that she values her idol more than their relationship, maybe the breakup is justified.\n\nBut here's the thing: the girl's answer was in response to a hypothetical. Maybe she didn't realize the weight of the question. She might have been in a fangirl mode, not considering the real implications. The guy, however, took it seriously and felt hurt, which is understandable. But did he give her a chance to explain or clarify her feelings? The situation seems to escalate quickly. He didn't wait to talk it through but immediately ended the relationship. That could be seen as impulsive.\n\nBut then again, if this is a core value for him\u2014he needs to feel that his partner would prioritize their relationship over an idol\u2014then breaking up might be his way of standing up for himself. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The community might argue that while her behavior is problematic, his response is also extreme. Breaking up over a hypothetical might not be fair. Alternatively, if he felt that her actions showed a lack of respect for their relationship, he might not be wrong.\n\nI think the key here is the hypothetical nature of the question. She might have been answering in the context of a joke or a game, not realizing the seriousness. The guy, on the other hand, took it as a real reflection of her priorities. But the fact that she was willing to go to Korea for the concert despite his illness might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration. However, a month-long relationship might not be the best foundation for making such a big decision.\n\nAlso, considering the girl's history of fangirling but not meeting the idol, her actions could be seen as a harmless passion. But when it comes to her hypothetical commitment, the line between a hobby and a relationship value is crossed. The guy might feel that her idol is more important to her than their relationship. But is it fair to break up over a hypothetical? Maybe not. Maybe he should have discussed it more.\n\nSo, weighing the two sides: the girl's response might be a red flag, but the guy's reaction is also impulsive. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the community thinks that the girl's answer was a deal-breaker and the guy had the right to end it, then the answer is B. If they think he overreacted, then A.\n\nBut in this case, since the girl's answer was a deal-breaker for the guy, and he ended the relationship, maybe it's not his fault. He might not be in the wrong. So the answer could be B, no he's not in the wrong.\n"
