We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point here is her response when he asked if she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentions he's okay with her fangirling, liking the artist, saving for a tattoo, etc. But the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't lie when he posed a hypothetical scenario about being in the hospital. Her answer being that she would still go to the concert made him break up with her.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, this might have been a test to see how she prioritizes him versus her obsession. If her answer was that she wouldn't hesitate to go to the concert despite his serious illness, that could feel like she doesn't value their relationship as much as her K-Pop idol. It's a significant emotional issue for him, leading to the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response might not be about not caring for him but could be about her commitment to her own interests. She might see K-Pop as a personal passion and not necessarily a competition. She might not have realized how much this behavior affected him. Also, the hypothetical scenario is extreme, and her answer might not reflect her real-life actions if the situation actually happened.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key. The boyfriend could have discussed his feelings before the hypothetical question. Maybe he didn't express that her fangirling made him feel insecure or less valued. The girlfriend might not have understood the depth of his feelings until that moment. \n\nThe question is whether he was wrong to break up. If he felt that her priorities were misaligned with his, then it's a valid reason. But if he didn't address the issue earlier and used the hypothetical as a trigger, maybe he's in the wrong. However, her answer being a dealbreaker might be justified if it showed a lack of commitment to the relationship. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intentions and communication. If the boyfriend felt this was a dealbreaker and couldn't move past it, he's not the asshole. But if he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand and acted impulsively, maybe he is. \n\nThe scenario here seems like a test of boundaries. If the boyfriend felt that her answer indicated she wouldn't be there for him in a crisis, breaking up is understandable. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
