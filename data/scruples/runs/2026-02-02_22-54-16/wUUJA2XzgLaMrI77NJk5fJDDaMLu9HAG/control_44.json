We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is super into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. She's been fangirling a lot, liking all his posts, saving for a tattoo, and even saying she'd go to a concert in Korea even if her partner was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, the guy seems to have tolerated a lot of her fangirling before. He mentions that he tries to pay attention even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign that her devotion to the idol is prioritized over their relationship. That led him to break up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's interests. The girlfriend's behavior might be excessive, but the key issue here is the guy's reaction. He set up a hypothetical scenario where his health was compromised and felt that her answer showed she didn't value their relationship. However, the problem is that this hypothetical is extreme. If he was actually in the hospital, that's a serious situation, but maybe he's using it as a test of her commitment. If she was serious in her answer, maybe he felt it was a deal-breaker. But breaking up instantly after that might be an overreaction, especially if he didn't communicate his feelings about her K-Pop obsession before. \n\nOn the other hand, if he felt that her prioritizing the idol over him in such a hypothetical scenario was a deal-breaker, then his decision might be justified. However, relationships require communication. If he had concerns about her fangirling before, he should have addressed them, rather than waiting for an extreme scenario. The sudden breakup without prior discussion might be seen as his fault. Also, her being honest about her feelings towards the idol doesn't make her the problem. So maybe the guy didn't handle it well, leading to him being the asshole here.\n"
