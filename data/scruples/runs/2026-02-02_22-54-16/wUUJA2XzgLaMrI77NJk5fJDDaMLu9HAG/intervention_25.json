We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has been dating for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop but tries to be supportive. The girl is really into Jung Yong Hwa and talks about him a lot. She's fangirling, liking everything on Instagram, planning a tattoo, and even says she'd go to his concert in Korea despite not having met him. The breaking point comes when the guy asks hypothetically if she'd still go if he were in the hospital, and she says she'd go regardless.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the guy felt heartbroken and couldn't handle the idea of her not prioritizing their relationship over her obsession. On the other hand, the girl's response might indicate that her commitment to her fandom is stronger than her commitment to the relationship. But is that the girl's fault? Or is the guy being overly sensitive?\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The guy tried to engage with her interests but had his limits. When her response was so firm, it showed that her devotion to K-Pop might be a dealbreaker for him. But breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could seem abrupt. However, the guy made it clear that this was a dealbreaker for him. In relationships, it's important that both partners can respect each other's boundaries. If her behavior made him feel unimportant, then his reaction is understandable. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of breaking up immediately, discussing the issue further could have been better. Still, if this was the final straw after ongoing issues, then it's his right to end things. The question is whether his reaction was justified. The girl's answer was honest, but if this level of obsession was always there and he couldn't accept it, then he's not the asshole. The answer is likely B.\n"
