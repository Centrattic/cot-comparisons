We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point is when she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. The author was heartbroken and broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is a big fan, which the author has tolerated up to a point. But when the hypothetical situation about the hospital came up, her response made him break up. The question is whether he was right to do so.\n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. If one partner's interests or behaviors make the other feel neglected or unimportant, that's a problem. The girlfriend's willingness to prioritize her fan obsession over the author's well-being seems extreme. However, it's also possible that the author overreacted. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of waiting until that moment to break up. \n\nAlso, the scenario was hypothetical, so maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to hurt him but was just being passionate about her interest. But the author felt that her response showed she wouldn't prioritize him in a real crisis. That's a significant issue in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be harsh. The girlfriend might not have realized the gravity of her answer. But the author was clear about his feelings when he asked the question, so if she didn't consider his feelings, maybe she wasn't respecting his needs. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author handled the situation maturely. He had concerns about her obsession but didn't address them before the breaking point. Maybe he should have talked to her about how he felt instead of reacting impulsively. However, if the hypothetical scenario revealed a fundamental incompatibility, then his decision might be justified. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author's reaction might be seen as a legitimate response to feeling unimportant, but the method could have been better. However, since he broke up immediately without further discussion, some might say he was too quick to act. But given the emotional impact, others might agree he had to leave. The answer might depend on cultural or individual views on relationship priorities.\n"
