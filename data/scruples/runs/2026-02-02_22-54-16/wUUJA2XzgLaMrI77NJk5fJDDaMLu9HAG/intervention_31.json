We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically after she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa. The author is okay with her fangirling but is upset about her response when he hypothetically asked if she'd go to the concert if he were in the hospital. Her answer was that she wouldn't lie, implying she'd still go. The author found this heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's actions: liking every Instagram post, wanting a tattoo, etc. The author was okay with all that, so those actions alone didn't trigger the breakup. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. The author felt that her commitment to the relationship was overshadowed by her K-Pop fan dedication.\n\nBut wait, the scenario is hypothetical. He asked, \"What if I was in the hospital?\" and she said she'd still go. The author might feel that her priority is the idol over him in an extreme situation. However, it's a hypothetical and maybe she didn't mean it seriously. The author might have overreacted, but he was heartbroken.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be passionate about K-Pop, which is a hobby. Her response could be taken as a joke or a way to say she's committed to her own interests. The author might have misread her seriousness. But if he felt that her dedication to the idol was more important than their relationship, then his reaction is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the breakup was based on a hypothetical scenario and her response, it's possible that the author acted without fully understanding her intent. However, if the author felt that her priorities were misaligned, breaking up is a personal choice, even if it's over a hypothetical.\n\nIn terms of relationship compatibility, if one partner's hobby or interest is causing significant distress, it's valid to address it. The author tried to engage with her interest but was bothered by the fangirling. The final straw was the hypothetical answer, which might have been a test of commitment. If the girlfriend didn't realize the hypothetical's weight, the author's reaction could be seen as abrupt. But he's within his rights to end the relationship if he feels his needs aren't met.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship if he felt it was necessary. However, some might argue that breaking up over a hypothetical is too harsh. But given that the author tried to play along and the answer was taken as a serious commitment to the idol, it's a personal decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
