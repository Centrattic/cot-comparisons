We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month and he's been trying to be supportive of her interests even though he doesn't like K-Pop himself. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign that she didn't value their relationship and ended things. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. He mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, the tattoo, and her general enthusiasm. The issue was her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's very ill. Her answer that she wouldn't lie suggests she meant she would go to the concert regardless. \n\nNow, is he wrong to break up over this? Well, relationships often depend on communication and mutual respect. If her fangirling was something he could tolerate but her response to the hospital question made him feel unimportant, maybe he's justified in ending it. However, the hypothetical situation might be a bit extreme. People can react to hypotheticals in ways that don't reflect real-life situations. Maybe he overreacted, but he states that her answer made him heartbroken. \n\nOn the other hand, is her response really that unreasonable? If she's a fan, she might prioritize her passion, but in a serious relationship, partners usually consider each other's feelings. However, she might not have intended to hurt him. Maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand. If he had talked about how her fangirling made him feel, maybe they could have resolved it. Instead, he waited until a hypothetical question to confront her, which might seem sudden. \n\nAlso, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital is a fair reason, that's debatable. Some might say yes because it's a real issue of commitment in a serious relationship. Others might say he should have been more understanding of her personal interests. \n\nSo, is the answer A or B? If he's justified in ending the relationship because her actions made him feel unimportant, then B (not in the wrong). If he overreacted without proper communication, then A. The key here is whether her response was a deal-breaker. The author states that he was okay with the tattoo and other things, so the breaking point was her hypothetical answer. That might be a valid reason for him to leave, even if others consider it extreme. Therefore, he might not be the asshole here.\n"
