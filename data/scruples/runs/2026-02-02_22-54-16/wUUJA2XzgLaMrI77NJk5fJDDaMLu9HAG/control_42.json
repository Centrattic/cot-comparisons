We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The user is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend have been dating seriously for over a month. He mentions that he's okay with her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, even the tattoo and saving for the concert. The issue came when she said she wouldn't miss the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign she doesn't value their relationship, leading to the breakup.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl is into K-Pop, which is a common interest, and she's vocal about her admiration. But the key point is her response to the hypothetical scenario. She didn't lie when asked if she would still go to the concert if he was in the hospital. The author interpreted her answer as her not prioritizing their relationship, which hurt him. \n\nBut wait, K-Pop is a huge global phenomenon, and many people are passionate about it. Her level of devotion might be intense, but is it reasonable to expect her to lie about her feelings? He asked a hypothetical that's a bit extreme\u2014being in the hospital. Maybe he was testing her loyalty, which isn't fair. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone's partner were in the hospital, wouldn't the expected response be to prioritize their well-being? But the girl didn't say she would go regardless of the situation. She just said she wouldn't hesitate. However, the author took that as her not caring about him, which might be an overreaction. \n\nThe question is whether breaking up over this is justified. The author admits he was okay with the tattoo and her other actions. The breaking point was her honesty in the hypothetical. But maybe the real issue is about underlying insecurities or expectations in the relationship. If the author expected her to downplay her fandom, that's an unrealistic expectation. \n\nAlternatively, her not considering the hypothetical seriously could be an issue. But she was honest, which is important in a relationship. The author's reaction was to call her a psycho and break up, which is drastic. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? Well, if the problem is her honesty, then he's being unfair. Relationships require compromise, but there's a line. However, if her priorities are so skewed that a serious illness wouldn't affect her plans, that's a red flag. However, the scenario is hypothetical and extreme. \n\nIn many cases, people have different passions, and it's about communication. The author might be projecting his expectations onto her. The girl might not have realized how much this was affecting him. But he could have addressed it earlier instead of using a hypothetical to test her. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction might be an overreaction. Breaking up because she was honest about her feelings, even if they conflict with his, might make him the asshole. But if her actions genuinely showed a lack of regard for their relationship, then it's not. However, the scenario is a hypothetical, and her response was honest. So, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue earlier and reacting so harshly.\n"
