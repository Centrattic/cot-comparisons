We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her response to a hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy is uncomfortable with her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, which he doesn't care for. He's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo, but her response to his hypothetical question about her going to the concert if he was in the hospital really upset him. She said she wouldn't lie, implying she wouldn't go. He broke up with her because of that.\n\nNow, the key points here. The breakup is based on her hypothetical response. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust and how each partner prioritizes the other are important. The girlfriend's fangirling might be a red flag if she's comparing or prioritizing a celebrity over her partner. However, the scenario is hypothetical. She didn't actually choose to go to the concert over him; she's stating her hypothetical stance. But the guy took it as a deal-breaker. \n\nIs breaking up over a hypothetical situation valid? Well, if this was a recurring issue that caused consistent conflict, maybe it's valid. But given that the guy was okay with her other behaviors and the breakup was triggered by a single hypothetical response, it might be a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship is only a month old, maybe they didn't have enough depth to handle such a situation. Breaking up over a hypothetical could be seen as overreacting. However, if he felt her priorities were misplaced, maybe he had a reason. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the hypothetical was a reasonable test of commitment. If he felt her hypothetical answer showed she wouldn't prioritize him in a real crisis, then maybe it's valid. But since it's a hypothetical, and she hasn't actually faced that situation, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at whether the action was proportionate. The guy's reaction is extreme\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up over a hypothetical. Even if he felt hurt, the way he reacted might be seen as the asshole move. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to feel hurt by her hypothetical answer, and choosing to end the relationship over a deal-breaker is his choice. However, others might argue he's overreacting. But in the context of a month-long relationship, it's his decision based on his red lines.\n"
