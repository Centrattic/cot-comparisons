We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is the asshole here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nHe's 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The main issue is her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. She's very complimentary about this artist, using words like \"talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet,\" etc. She hasn't met him but likes his Instagram posts and is saving for a tattoo. He's okay with all of that. Then the breaking point happens when she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. The author asks that hypothetical, and she says she would go regardless, leading him to break up.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the duration of the relationship is just over a month. That's not a long time, but they consider it serious. In a new relationship, people often discover each other's quirks. He's okay with her K-Pop interest up to a point, but this particular response crosses a line for him.\n\nHer response implies that her commitment to the K-Pop artist might be more important than her commitment to him. The hypothetical scenario is extreme\u2014being in the hospital is a very serious situation. If she's willing to prioritize going to the concert over being there for him in that scenario, it's understandable that he feels hurt and betrayed.\n\nHe says he didn't expect her to be serious, so he took her answer at face value. Her answer being nonchalant and not lying makes him feel heartbroken. He then calls her a psycho and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Breaking up because of differing priorities is not inherently wrong. Relationships require compromise and compatibility. If one partner's interests are so extreme that they overshadow the other's needs in critical situations, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, the timing and the way he reacted might be factors. He's 18, so maybe he's still figuring out communication in relationships.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key issue is whether her response was a deal-breaker. If he felt that her priorities were not aligned with his values (i.e., in a crisis, her commitment to a celebrity over him), then he's justified. However, maybe he overreacted? But the scenario presented is that he was heartbroken and couldn't handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have been joking or not realized the seriousness of the hypothetical. However, she clarified she was serious. So she's not lying, which could mean she truly values the K-Pop fandom more than her relationship in such scenarios. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and understanding. If one partner can't make time for the other in a critical situation, that's a red flag. But is that the author's fault? He's reacting to her priorities. He might not be in the wrong because he made a decision based on his feelings. However, breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be seen as impulsive. But the scenario is presented as a real hypothetical, and she confirmed she would go regardless. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer depends on whether the breakup was a reasonable response. Since he was hurt and felt that her priorities were misplaced in a critical situation, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
