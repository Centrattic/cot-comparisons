We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key points here are the girlfriend's extreme fangirling, her constant admiration for the artist, and the breaking point where she said she'd go to the concert even if the guy was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The boyfriend mentions he's tried to be patient, even okay with the tattoo, but her response to the hypothetical scenario was the final straw. The question is whether he overreacted.\n\nHe broke up because she was emotionally unresponsive and unwilling to consider his feelings. The girlfriend didn't lie when asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was sick. The boyfriend felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author (the boyfriend) is the asshole. To decide, I should weigh both sides. The girlfriend's behavior might be seen as obsessive, especially the tattoo and the extreme commitment to the concert despite the relationship. However, the boyfriend's reaction was immediate and harsh. Did he communicate his feelings beforehand? The post says he tried to pay attention and was okay with most things, but this was the breaking point. \n\nThe girlfriend's response showed she wasn't willing to compromise, which could be a valid reason for breaking up. But the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off\u2014might come off as impulsive. However, in relationships, if one partner's actions are causing emotional harm, walking away isn't always wrong. The key is whether the actions were reasonable given the context.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at communication and whether the breaking point was justified. If the boyfriend had discussed his feelings earlier and she still didn't change, maybe. But in this case, he waited until the last straw. The girlfriend's response indicated she wasn't prioritizing the relationship in that hypothetical scenario. So maybe the breakup is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the tattoo and fangirling before might have been red flags he ignored. Breaking up over one issue might be harsh if there were previous signs. But the final answer hinges on whether her response was a dealbreaker. Given that she was unwilling to even consider his hypothetical scenario, it's a valid reason. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
