We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they've been dating seriously for over a month. The girl is really into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The author isn't into K-Pop but tries to be understanding. The girl is very fangirl-like, complimenting him a lot, even though she's not exactly complimentary to the author. She likes all his posts, is saving for a tattoo, and wanted to go to his concert in Korea. Then comes the key point where she says she would go even if the author was in the hospital. The author is heartbroken and breaks up.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nHmm. Let's consider the factors. The couple is young, both 18. They've been dating a month, which is a short time. The author's issue isn't her liking K-Pop but her prioritizing Jung Yong Hwa over him in a hypothetical scenario. The problem is whether her response was unreasonable. \n\nThe girl was completely honest, saying she wouldn't lie. That's her stance. The author felt it was a deal-breaker. But is that a valid reason? Well, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If one partner's interests or values are causing significant distress, it's a problem. \n\nBut here, the author's reaction seems extreme. He called her a psycho and broke up immediately. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of waiting for that moment. Also, considering the hypothetical scenario\u2014how realistic is it? She might not have meant it literally. But she's adamant. \n\nHowever, the author's actions were a direct response to a boundary he felt was crossed. If he truly felt that her devotion was more important than their relationship, then his reaction is his way of valuing himself. But is that the wrong approach? It depends on communication and whether there was a chance to discuss it. \n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer. The key is whether he's in the wrong. The girl's answer was honest, which he didn't expect. He might not be wrong if he felt it was a deal-breaker. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it better. Since he acted based on his feelings, even if others might think he could have discussed it more, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The girl's behavior seems extreme, but it's her choice. The author's reaction is a personal choice based on his values. So B makes sense.\n"
