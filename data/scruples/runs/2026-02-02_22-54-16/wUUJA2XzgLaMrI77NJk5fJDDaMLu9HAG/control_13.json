We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating seriously for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop but tries to be supportive. The girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and liking every post. The breaking point was when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd go regardless. He called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guy was okay with her K-Pop interest, including the tattoo. The issue was her response to a hypothetical where her partner is seriously ill. She didn't prioritize his well-being over her fandom. That seems like a big red flag. \n\nBut wait, the relationship was only a month. Maybe he acted too quickly? Or maybe her response showed a lack of empathy or commitment. On the other hand, he set up a hypothetical that's extreme. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of breaking up suddenly. But her answer indicated that her devotion to a celebrity might override her relationship. That's a dealbreaker for some people. \n\nIs it wrong to break up over this? If someone's commitment to a celebrity seems to outweigh their commitment to their partner in such a scenario, it's valid to end things. But was the breakup too hasty? The user did say he was heartbroken, so maybe he felt it was the only way after that conversation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have discussed his feelings more before the breakup. But given her answer, which was so direct and nonchalant, he might feel betrayed. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. However, the question is whether he was in the wrong. If her actions showed she valued the celebrity over their relationship in a critical situation, then breaking up isn't the wrong choice. So, answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
