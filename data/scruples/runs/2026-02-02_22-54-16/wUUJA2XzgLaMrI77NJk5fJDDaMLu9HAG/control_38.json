We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa. She's fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and even likes every post on Instagram. The breaking point was when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, and she said she'd go anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend is upset that she values this celebrity over him. The girlfriend seems to be into the artist, but maybe she didn't mean it literally. The problem is that the question was extreme, and her answer was nonchalant. He felt heartbroken and broke up. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He might have felt disrespected or replaced by her fandom. But maybe she didn't realize the depth of his feelings. On the other hand, she might have seen it as a hypothetical and wasn't being serious. \n\nHe did say he tried to understand her love for K-Pop, so he wasn't entirely dismissive. However, the breaking point was a hypothetical that she took literally. Was his reaction too harsh? Breaking up over this might be a big overreaction if she didn't mean it that way. But if he felt her commitment wasn't there, maybe he had a right to be hurt. \n\nThe key is whether her answer was a dealbreaker. If he couldn't handle her level of fandom, maybe they weren't compatible. But the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014could be seen as impulsive rather than in the wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer is B, he's not the asshole. He had the right to feel hurt and set boundaries. If her behavior was a dealbreaker for him, ending the relationship is his choice. However, maybe there was a lack of communication on both sides. But since he tried to engage and then this happened, he's not necessarily wrong.\n"
