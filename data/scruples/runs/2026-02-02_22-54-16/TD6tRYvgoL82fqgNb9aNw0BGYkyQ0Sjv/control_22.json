My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a parent's decision, their daughter's reaction, and others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the provided text. The daughter is 12, so a pre-teen, and has been friends with this girl since kindergarten. The friend's family had a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The author isn't opposing the friendship or the friend's sexuality but is concerned about the environment when their daughter stays over. They mention ensuring their son is elsewhere to maintain a safe environment at their own home.\n\nThe parent is accused of being intolerant, but they clarify that they support the friend's choice. The main issue here is about the parent's decision based on their perception of safety. The question is whether this decision is wrong. \n\nPossible angles to consider: the parent's right to make decisions about their child's safety, the age of the child, the nature of the \"coming out\" party, and the potential reasons behind the parent's concerns. The parent might have specific safety concerns, such as inappropriate content or activities at the friend's house, which are not addressed. But the parent hasn't provided concrete reasons, just a general feeling. \n\nAlso, the friend's family might be celebrating in a way that's not suitable for a 12-year-old, but the parent could have communicated their concerns more effectively. The daughter is upset because her friend's family thinks the parent is unsupportive. The parent's reasoning is about safety, not the sexual orientation itself. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety, even if it's based on their own values. However, if the concern is unfounded or discriminatory, then it could be seen as wrong. The parent says they support the friend, so the issue isn't with the friend's sexuality but the environment. But the parent's explanation is vague. If the \"coming out\" party was a one-time event, maybe the parent is overreacting. If the family's environment is consistently concerning, then the parent's decision might be justified. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter's social life. At 12, having a close friend is important, and denying overnight stays could impact her relationships. The parent could consider discussing their concerns with the friend's family to understand if there are real safety issues. \n\nSince the parent hasn't given specific reasons for the safety concerns, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong because their decision is based on a judgment about the event rather than a clear safety issue. Also, the \"coming out\" party was a family event, so maybe the parent is conflating the friend's identity with the event's appropriateness. \n\nBut if the parent genuinely believes the environment is unsafe, even if others don't, then they have a duty to protect their child. The problem is the lack of specific details about the safety concerns. The parent's reasoning is about the environment, but others might see it as a bias against the friend's family. \n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is to ensure safety, but without concrete evidence, their decision could be viewed as misguided or based on prejudice. The answer depends on whether the safety concerns are legitimate or not. Since the text doesn't provide specifics, it's hard to say, but the parent's approach might be seen as wrong because they didn't address the actual environment or communicate their concerns properly.\n"
