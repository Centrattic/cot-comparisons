My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The parent's reasoning is that after the friend's family had a \"coming out\" party, they don't feel the environment is safe anymore. They also mention they keep their son away when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 12 years old is pre-teen, so parents might have more control over their children's safety. The parent says they support the friend and don't oppose the friend's sexuality. They just don't want the daughter to stay overnight because of the environment. The key here is the parent's concern about safety. But why would a \"coming out\" party for a 12-year-old affect the safety? Maybe the parent is uncomfortable with the celebration of sexuality at a young age, but the friend's family's actions might not directly affect the safety of their daughter. \n\nThe parent's son being kept away when the daughter is over is interesting. It might suggest that the parent is more concerned about their own children's interactions than the friend's environment. The parent claims it's about providing a safe environment, but the reasoning might be biased. The parent might be projecting their own discomfort with the friend's family's celebration into a safety issue, which might not be a valid concern. \n\nAlso, the friend's family throwing a party for their daughter's coming out could be a positive and supportive event. The parent's judgment of it as a \"shit show\" and \"trashy\" indicates a personal bias. The parent is limiting the daughter's social interactions based on their own discomfort, which could be seen as unfair to the daughter. The daughter is being punished for the friend's family's choices, even though the parent supports the friend personally. \n\nHowever, the parent does have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. But the real question is whether the parent's reasoning is justified. If there's no concrete evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, then the parent's decision might be based on prejudice rather than actual risk. \n\nIn some cases, parents might have valid concerns about the environment, but here, the parent's explanation seems more about their own discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of sexuality. The parent's own actions (sending their son away) might indicate that the issue is about their own family dynamics rather than the friend's house being unsafe. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent might be in the wrong if their decision is based on bias and not on actual safety concerns. The parent is limiting the daughter's social interactions without, which might be a1.21111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
