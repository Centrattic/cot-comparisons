My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is a parent who decided not to allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her best friend's house because her friend is lesbian, and the friend's parents had a \"coming out\" party for her. The parent is getting criticized for being intolerant but claims they support the girl and just don't want their daughter in an environment they consider unsafe.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the daughter's best friend is lesbian and the parents threw a coming out party. The parent finds this inappropriate for a 12-year-old and feels the environment isn't safe for their daughter. But they also clarify that they didn't terminate the friendship and support the girl's happiness. \n\nNow, the key points here are about parental rights and the reasons behind the decision. The parent is a guardian and has the responsibility to ensure their child's safety. They mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. The parent's concern is about the environment being safe, but the reason given is the daughter's friend's sexuality and the party. \n\nI need to question if the parent's reasoning is based on genuine safety concerns or if there's an underlying bias. The parent claims it's about safety, but the friend's sexual orientation itself doesn't inherently make the environment unsafe. Unless there's a specific risk, like if the friend's home has elements that could be harmful to the daughter, the parent's decision might be discriminatory. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, and same-sex relationships or identities are part of who someone is. The parent's disapproval of the coming out party could indicate discomfort with the daughter's friend's sexuality, which might border on prejudice. The parent's justification about safety might be a cover for their own biases, even if they claim not to be intolerant. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes that the friend's home isn't a safe place for their daughter, perhaps due to other factors not mentioned here (like other activities at the friend's house, lack of supervision, etc.), then their decision could be justified. But since the only reason stated is the daughter's friend's sexuality and the party, it's likely that the parent is acting on prejudice, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlso, the daughter is in a close friendship, and the parent is disrupting that without a clear safety issue. The parent's action might be seen as not supporting the daughter's emotional well-being by cutting off her best friend. The parent's claim that they support the girl's happiness could be in conflict with limiting her friendships. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, supporting children's friendships, especially when they're best friends, is important. The parent's decision could be harming the daughter's feelings and the friend's feelings. The parent is facing criticism for being intolerant, which might be valid if the root of the decision is based on the friend's sexual orientation rather than actual safety. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's reasoning seems to stem from discomfort with the daughter's friend's sexuality and the associated celebration, rather than a legitimate safety concern. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover based on the friend's sexual orientation, even if they claim it's about safety.\n"
