My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe parent is a parent of a 12-year-old daughter who's very close to her best friend, who is a lesbian. The friend's family threw a coming-out party for her, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then told their daughter they don't want her to stay the night at her friend's house anymore. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend's sexuality but don't want their daughter to stay overnight there. The parent mentions that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere to ensure a safe environment. So the parent is concerned about the environment at the friend's house, but not their own son's presence.\n\nThe parent's key points: they support the friend, they're not terminating the friendship, but they feel the friend's home isn't safe for an overnight stay. The question is whether this decision is wrong. \n\nPossible angles to consider: At 12, children are still young, and the parent's concern about safety and appropriateness is valid. However, the parent's justification might be seen as using \"safety\" as a cover for discomfort with the friend's sexuality, even though they claim to support her. Also, the friend's family threw a coming-out party, which might be seen as a positive gesture of support. The parent's decision could be perceived as not supporting the friend's family, even if the parent personally supports the friend.\n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as inconsistent. They support the friend but are restricting their daughter's visit, possibly due to the friend's sexual orientation. The parent's argument about safety might be subjective. If the parent is applying the same standard to other situations (like their son being elsewhere), maybe they have a legitimate safety concern, but if it's only in relation to the friend's home, it might be biased.\n\nLaws and societal norms: In many places, it's legal and acceptable for parents to make decisions about their children's safety. However, the friend's family isn't necessarily violating any laws. The parent's actions could be viewed as discriminatory if the real issue is the friend's sexuality rather than an actual unsafe environment.\n\nThe daughter feels hurt because her parent is restricting her friend time, which is a significant part of her life. The parent's action might be impacting the daughter's emotional well-being and the perception of support for her friend.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: If the parent's real issue is with the friend's sexuality, then yes, they're being discriminatory. But if their concern is genuinely about the environment (like inappropriate parties for a child) and they have a policy about overnight stays in general, maybe not. However, the parent's own example about their son being elsewhere when the daughter stays might indicate that safety concerns are situational, not based on the friend's home specifically.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is a bit conflicting. They say they support the friend but don't allow overnight visits, which could be seen as not fully supporting the friend's family. The coming-out party might be a red flag for the parent, but for others, it's a supportive gesture. The key here is whether the parent's decision is based on genuine safety concerns or underlying homophobia.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory if the safety concerns are a pretext for discomfort with the friend's sexuality. However, if there's a legitimate safety issue (like the environment at the friend's house being inappropriate for a child), then it's a valid decision. The parent's example about their son suggests that safety is a priority in their home, but the friend's home might not meet that standard. Without more evidence of actual danger, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice, making them in the wrong. So the answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
