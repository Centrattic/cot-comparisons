My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says their daughter is 12 and they're upset about her staying over a friend's house after the friend's family had a \"coming out\" party. The author mentions they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay there, citing safety. They also mention separating their son when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, which is a young age. The friend's family threw a coming out party, which the author finds inappropriate. They think it's too early to celebrate a child's sexuality. But the author isn't ending the friendship; they just don't want the daughter to stay overnight. They claim it's about safety, not the friend's sexuality. However, their reasoning might be influenced by their discomfort with the friend's sexual orientation and the party. \n\nThe author's explanation about safety might not hold up if there's no actual evidence that the friend's house is unsafe. They mention separating their son when the daughter is over, which seems similar to their reasoning for not allowing the daughter to stay at the friend's. Maybe they're using safety as a cover for their discomfort with the friend's sexual orientation. \n\nAlso, the daughter is close to this friend, so cutting off overnight visits could affect their friendship. The author claims to support the friend's happiness but is restricting a core part of their daughter's social life. The community's reaction is that the author is being intolerant, which could be valid if the author's actions are based on prejudice. \n\nBut the author might have legitimate concerns about safety, though they don't specify what exactly makes the friend's house unsafe. If there's no concrete reason, then their decision might be based on bias. The key here is whether the author's decision is justified by actual safety concerns or if it's a way to avoid supporting their daughter's friend's identity. \n\nIn conclusion, if the safety concerns are fabricated or based on prejudice, the author is in the wrong. If there are real safety issues, maybe not. But since the author hasn't provided specific reasons beyond the coming out party, which they found inappropriate but not unsafe, it's likely their actions are discriminatory. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
