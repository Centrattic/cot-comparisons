My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party for their daughter, which the parent found inappropriate because the child is 12. The parent's reasoning is about providing a safe environment, referencing how they make sure their son isn't home when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that the party was too adult-oriented for a 12-year-old and that the environment isn't safe. But the daughter is best friends with the other child, so cutting off sleepovers could be hurtful. The parent says they support the friend but don't want the daughter to stay overnight. The parent also mentions keeping their son away when the daughter is over, which is about their own child's safety, not the friend's.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is the friend's home environment. The parent is making a judgment based on the \"coming out\" party, which might not be the best indicator of a safe environment. At 12, it's common for kids to explore their identities, and a supportive family environment is important. The parent's decision could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is upset and others perceive the parent as intolerant. The parent's reasoning about safety might not align with the actual risk; they're more concerned about the friend's family environment than their own.\n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes the friend's home isn't suitable, maybe due to adult themes or activities that a 12-year-old shouldn't be exposed to, then it's their right to make that call. But the parent is using the \"safe environment\" as a reason, so I need to assess if that's a valid concern. The \"coming out\" party might have been a family celebration, but unless there was something unsafe (like inappropriate content, adult activities not suitable for a 12-year-old), the parent's reasoning might not hold up. \n\nAlso, the parent allows the daughter to visit the friend's house during the day but not overnight. That could be inconsistent unless there's a specific reason tied to the overnight stay itself. The parent's own actions (moving their son when the daughter is over) are about their own home's safety, not the friend's. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety. However, if the friend's parents are providing a supportive and appropriate environment for their child, the parent's refusal might come across as discriminatory or overly cautious. The daughter's friendship is important, so cutting off sleepovers could impact her emotionally. The parent's support for the friend's sexuality is mentioned, but the action of not allowing overnight stays might still be seen as not fully supporting the friend's family. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter's feelings. She's close to her friend, and the parent's decision is causing her distress. The parent could be failing to consider the emotional impact on their daughter. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because their reasoning for the \"safe environment\" is questionable, and they're making a decision that affects their daughter's social life based on a party that might not have been inappropriate for a 12-year-old. Unless there was an actual unsafe element, the parent's decision could be seen as overprotective or judgmental. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But if the parent genuinely believes the environment is unsafe, maybe B. However, without concrete evidence of danger, the answer is likely A.\n"
