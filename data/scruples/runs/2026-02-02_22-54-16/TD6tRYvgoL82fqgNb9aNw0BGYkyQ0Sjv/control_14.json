My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent deciding not to let their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parents of the friend had a \"coming out\" party for the girl, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The author claims they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay over, citing safety concerns, similar to how they make their son leave when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they support the friend and her sexuality, so it's not a matter of intolerance. However, they're worried about the \"safe environment\" at the friend's house. But why would the friend's family not be a safe environment? The parent compares it to when their son has to leave when their daughter is over, implying that they want to ensure appropriate supervision for their daughter. But if the friend's family is hosting a party celebrating the daughter's identity, maybe there's a different dynamic there. However, the parent didn't specify any actual safety issues\u2014like unsafe conditions, lack of supervision, or anything inappropriate happening. It's possible the parent is uncomfortable with the party or the celebration of sexuality at that age, leading them to make a judgment based on their own discomfort rather than concrete safety concerns.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, so this is a time when parents might be cautious about overnight stays, especially with friends of the opposite sex. But in this case, the friend is a girl, so the parent's concern might be more about the party and the family's handling of the child's sexuality. The parent's reasoning about safety could be a cover for their own discomfort with the \"coming out\" party. Since there's no evidence that the friend's home is unsafe, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice or misunderstanding, even if they claim support. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent has specific concerns about the environment at the friend's house, like lack of supervision or inappropriate activities, that's one thing. But in this case, the parent's reasoning seems to hinge on the party, which they found \"trashy.\" The fact that they're using \"safe environment\" without concrete examples might make their decision seem like an overreaction or fueled by bias, even if they don't intend it. \n\nAlso, the daughter's feelings are hurt because she's close to the friend, and the parent's decision is causing family tension. The parent claims they support the friend, but the action of cutting off overnight visits might not align with that support. It could be seen as a way to avoid the situation or the party rather than addressing the actual safety aspect. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's decision seems more about their own discomfort with the celebration of the child's sexuality at that age rather than genuine safety concerns. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong because their action is based on prejudice or misunderstanding, even if they don't mean to be intolerant. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
