My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who refused their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for their daughter. The parent found it inappropriate for a 12-year-old, calling it a \"shit show\" and \"trashy.\" That seems like a judgment of the family's values or the way they handled their daughter's sexuality. The parent then decided not to allow overnight stays, leading to conflict with their daughter and others perceiving them as intolerant.\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about a \"safe environment.\" However, they also mention they send their son elsewhere when the daughter stays over, which is a different scenario. The key issue here is the parent's reasoning for the decision. \n\nIs the parent's reasoning valid? The parent is making a decision based on their disapproval of the friend's family's celebration of their daughter's sexuality. But since the daughter is 12, the parent's authority is significant, but the friend's family's actions might be their choice. The parent's concern about a \"safe environment\" isn't clearly explained\u2014maybe they're worried about inappropriate content at the party or future events, but that's speculative. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, the parent's explanation might be seen as discriminatory if they're targeting the friend's family because they're lesbian. The parent claims not to be intolerant, but their actions could be perceived as such. The daughter's right to socialize is also a factor here. \n\nThe parent's action of not allowing overnight stays could be seen as a parental decision, but the reasoning might be flawed if it's based on prejudice rather than genuine safety concerns. The parent should consider whether their decision is based on actual risks or personal discomfort with the friend's family's lifestyle. \n\nIn conclusion, while parents have the right to make decisions for their children, the parent's reasoning here could be problematic if it's rooted in bias against the friend's family's sexual orientation rather than a legitimate safety issue. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
