My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent deciding not to let their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parents had a \"coming out\" party for the friend, which the author found inappropriate. The parent's reasoning is about safety, mentioning that they separate their son when their daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's stated reasons. They claim it's about safety, not intolerance. They say they support the friend and aren't cutting off the friendship. But the key issue is the overnight stay. The parent's son is not present when the daughter is over, so they might be concerned about co-ed situations or other factors.\n\nBut wait, the daughter is 12, which is a pre-teen age. Parents might have different comfort levels with their child staying overnight, regardless of the friend's sexuality. However, the parent's comment about the \"coming out\" party being a \"shit show\" suggests discomfort with the friend's sexuality. Even if the parent says they support the friend, the reaction to the party could indicate underlying biases. The parent might be conflating the celebration with their own discomfort, leading to a decision that seems discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions not trusting the friend's environment. But they don't provide specific reasons why it's unsafe. Is there a valid safety concern, or is it a pretext for discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of their sexuality? The parent's own actions (moving their son when the daughter is over) don't seem to apply to the friend's house, which could imply hypocrisy or a lack of actual safety concerns.\n\nLaws vary by location, but in many places, parents have the right to decide their child's activities, but if discrimination is involved, that could be a different issue. However, the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely, which complicates things. They're focusing on overnight stays, which might be a personal boundary they feel is necessary for safety.\n\nBut if the safety concern is a cover for the parent's discomfort with the friend's sexuality, then it could be considered discriminatory. The parent's reaction to the party suggests they might not fully accept the friend's identity, which could affect their judgment of the environment. Even if the parent's intention is safety, the underlying bias might make the decision unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, parents are allowed to have different boundaries. If the parent genuinely believes it's unsafe without any specific issues, it's their choice. However, the lack of concrete safety concerns and the parent's negative reaction to the party might indicate that the decision is based more on prejudice than actual risk.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision seems to stem from discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than legitimate safety concerns. The parent's justification of safety isn't backed by specific examples, and their reaction to the party suggests intolerance, which makes their decision discriminatory.\n"
