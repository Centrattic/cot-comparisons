My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent is saying they don't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent explains that they support the friend and her sexuality but feel the friend's house isn't a safe environment for an overnight stay. They also mention that when their daughter has friends over, they make sure their son is elsewhere, not because they don't trust him, but for safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They are concerned about safety, but the specific issue is the friend's family being lesbian. The parent isn't opposing the friendship but is worried about the environment when staying over. However, the parent's explanation about their son being elsewhere might be a red herring. They make their son leave when friends come over, implying they're creating a safe space for their daughter. But if they do that at home, maybe the same logic applies when the daughter is at the friend's house. However, the parent is applying a different standard there.\n\nNext, the parent's justification for disapproving the overnight stay is based on the friend's family being lesbian. The parent mentions the \"coming out\" party as a trigger. But the friend is only 12, so maybe the party was more about celebrating the friend's identity, which the parent finds premature or inappropriate. However, the parent claims they support the friend, so the issue isn't about the friend's sexuality but about the environment.\n\nBut then, the parent's reasoning might be based on a stereotype or prejudice, thinking that a same-sex parent household isn't safe. There's no mention of any actual unsafe behavior from the friend's family. The parent's son is also part of the household, but they don't mention any issues there. The parent is applying different rules based on the family structure, which could be discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the daughter is in a close friendship, and the parent is interfering with her social life without clear justification beyond their own discomfort with the family's celebration of their sexuality. The parent's reasoning might be influenced by their own biases, even if they claim to support the friend. They are allowing daytime visits but not overnight, which seems inconsistent unless there's a specific safety concern not mentioned.\n\nIn terms of legal and social aspects, in many places, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children, but if those boundaries are based on discrimination, that could be problematic. The parent's argument that the environment isn't safe lacks concrete evidence. It might be a way to avoid dealing with their own discomfort about the friend's family structure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's decision is likely based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are denying their daughter the right to be in a friend's home based on the family's sexuality without valid reasons, which is discriminatory and harmful to the daughter's friendship and the friend's family.\n"
