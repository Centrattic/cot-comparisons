My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who refused their daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. The situation involves a 12-year-old girl whose best friend is a lesbian. The parent disapproves of the friend's sexuality and the celebration, leading to the decision to stop overnight visits. The parent claims they support the friend but want to ensure a safe environment for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the friend's family is hosting a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate. The key issue here is the parent's comfort with the friend's sexuality. The parent isn't opposing the friendship itself but is concerned about the safety of their daughter's stay. However, the parent's argument about safety is vague. They mention making sure their son is elsewhere when the friend is over, which might relate to their own child's safety, but not the friend's.\n\nNext, societal context. In many places, supporting LGBTQ+ rights is widely accepted, and discrimination based on sexuality is frowned upon. The parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory if based solely on the friend's sexuality without valid safety concerns. The parent's claim that they support the friend's happiness is contradictory to their actions, which might be seen as intolerant despite their claims.\n\nAlso, the child's age is 12, which is when many start exploring their identity. The parent's decision might hinder the child's social development and sense of support from family. The parent's justification about safety is questionable because there's no evidence presented that the friend's family is unsafe. The parent's own safety measures involve their son, not the friend's family, so the concern might be misplaced.\n\nLegally, unless there are specific safety issues (like abuse, neglect, etc.), parents can make decisions about their children's social lives. However, the ethical aspect comes into play. The parent's actions might be seen as reinforcing negative attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community, even if unintentionally. The parent's reasoning about the \"coming out\" party seems to be a trigger for their discomfort with the friend's sexuality, which isn't a valid reason to restrict the friendship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has the legal right to make such a decision, the ethical stance leans towards the parent being in the wrong. The decision is based on prejudice against the friend's sexuality rather than a legitimate safety concern, which is harmful to the child's well-being and the friend's family.\n"
