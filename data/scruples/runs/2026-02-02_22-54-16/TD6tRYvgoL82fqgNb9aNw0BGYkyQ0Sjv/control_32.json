My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who\u4e0d\u8ba9 their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her friend's house, which the friend's parents recently hosted a \"coming out\" party for their daughter. The parent's reasoning is about providing a safe environment, mentioning they separate their son when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that the friend's home isn't safe because of the \"coming out\" party. But wait, the friend is 12 and identifying as lesbian. The parent's objection seems to stem from discomfort with the celebration of a child's sexuality. However, they do support the friend and aren't telling their daughter to end the friendship. So maybe their main concern is about the appropriateness of the party rather than the friend's sexuality itself.\n\nBut the parent's reasoning about safety is a bit unclear. They mention separating their son when the daughter stays, which might be about privacy or appropriate supervision, but the friend's home isn't described as having similar issues. The parent might be conflating the \"coming out\" party as a threat to safety, which isn't necessarily the case. At 12, children are in middle school, and parents might have different comfort levels, but the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's identity, which is a positive thing. \n\nThe parent is being accused of intolerance, which is a serious accusation. However, the parent isn't opposing the friendship but the overnight stays. The key question is whether the parent's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or personal discomfort. The scenario doesn't provide evidence of any actual safety issues at the friend's home, like neglect or abuse. The parent's own actions (separating their son) are about their own home's safety protocols, not the friend's home's conditions.\n\nSo, the parent's decision seems to be based on personal discomfort with the \"coming out\" party rather than a real safety concern. This could be seen as making a judgment about the friend's family based on their celebration, which might not be justified. Supporting a child's friend's identity is important, and while parents can set boundaries, the reasoning here might not hold up as legitimate. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover based on those grounds.\n"
