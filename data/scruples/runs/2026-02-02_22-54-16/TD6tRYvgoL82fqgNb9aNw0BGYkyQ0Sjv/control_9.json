My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the parent's daughter is 12, and they're close friends. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then told their daughter she can't stay there anymore. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship, just the sleepovers.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about safety. They mention that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. The parent isn't against the friend's sexuality but feels the environment isn't safe for an overnight stay. \n\nNow, considering the age of the children, 12 is a young age where parents might be more cautious about unsupervised sleepovers. The parent is expressing concern for their daughter's safety, which can be a valid reason. However, the friend's family's celebration of their daughter's sexuality doesn't inherently make the environment unsafe. The parent's judgment that the environment is unsafe isn't explained further, so it's unclear if there were specific incidents or just a general discomfort with the party.\n\nThe parent's argument is about safety, not the friend's sexuality directly. But the perception from others is that they're being intolerant. The key here is whether the parent's decision was based on legitimate safety concerns or a misunderstanding of the situation. Without specific safety issues mentioned, like past incidents or lack of supervision, the parent's decision might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is upset and the friend's family is portrayed as supportive.\n\nHowever, the parent does mention they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. The decision is about sleepovers, not the relationship itself. So the parent is making a judgment call for their child's safety, which is a parent's right. But if there's no concrete reason beyond discomfort with the party, it might be seen as wrong to deny the sleepover based on that. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many parents allow sleepovers at this age, provided the environment is safe. The parent's reasoning here is a bit vague. They might be conflating the celebration of the friend's sexuality with an unsafe environment, which could be a bias. However, the parent is within their rights to make decisions they feel are in their child's best interest, even if others disagree. \n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong if they genuinely believe the environment isn't safe, even if others disagree. But if there's no legitimate safety issue, it could be seen as wrong. Since the parent doesn't provide specific safety concerns, it's ambiguous. However, the parent's stance is about safety, not the friend's sexuality, so they might not be in the wrong. But others might see it as a mistake to judge the environment solely based on a party that celebrates the friend's identity.\n"
