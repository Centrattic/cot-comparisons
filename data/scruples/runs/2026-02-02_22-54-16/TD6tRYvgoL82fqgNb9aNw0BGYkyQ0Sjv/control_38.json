My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter's friend had a \"coming out party,\" which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent's reasoning is about ensuring a safe environment, mentioning that they separate their own children during overnight stays. The daughter is upset, and others are criticizing the parent as intolerant.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the parent's decision is based on safety concerns, but they also express discomfort with the celebration of sexuality at a young age. The friend's family's approach might be seen as supportive, but the parent is worried about the environment being \"unsafe.\" However, the safety concern here is a bit unclear. Are there actual risks like physical harm, or is it more about the parent's personal beliefs about sexuality?\n\nIn terms of legal and societal standards, in many places, it's legal and accepted for same-sex relationships, so the parent's objection might be based on personal views rather than objective safety. The parent does say they support the friend's happiness but is concerned about the environment. The argument about safety might be a cover for the parent's discomfort with the friend's sexuality. \n\nAlso, the parent's own practice of separating their children during overnight stays suggests that they have control over their own home's environment, but they're making a judgment about the friend's home. There's a possible inconsistency here. \n\nConsidering child well-being, the daughter is close to her friend, and suddenly cutting off overnight visits might affect her emotionally. The parent's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over the daughter's social needs, unless there's a valid safety concern. \n\nHowever, the parent is within their rights to set boundaries for their child's safety. The challenge is whether the safety concern is justified. If the friend's family is supportive and there's no evidence of risk, the parent's decision might stem from prejudice rather than actual danger. \n\nIn conclusion, if the safety concern is a pretext for intolerance, then the parent is in the wrong. But if there's a genuine safety issue, they're not. The question is whether the parent's reasoning is based on real safety or personal bias. Given the parent's statement that they support the friend's happiness but don't want their daughter there, it leans towards the former being a cover for the latter. Therefore, the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
