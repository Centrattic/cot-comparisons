My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The daughter has a close friend since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then prohibited the daughter from staying over, leading to conflict.\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's house isn't a safe environment for an overnight stay. They mention that they separate their own son when the daughter is over, to ensure a safe environment. \n\nNow, considering the parent's reasoning: They don't oppose the friendship or the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment. The key here is the parent's belief about safety. However, the friend's family is part of the LGBTQ+ community, which isn't inherently unsafe. The parent's judgment might stem from discomfort with the \"coming out\" party, which they found trashy. \n\nPotential issues here: The parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory if they're making a blanket statement about LGBTQ+ households being unsafe. Also, the daughter's autonomy and feelings are important at 12. The parent's actions might inadvertently send the message that LGBTQ+ families aren't safe, which is a harmful stereotype.\n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes there's a specific reason the friend's house isn't safe (like inappropriate behavior at the party), that's different. But the parent didn't mention any specific safety issues beyond their discomfort with the celebration.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual safety concerns. This could lead others to perceive the parent as intolerant, even if that's not their intention. The parent's explanation about separating their son is about creating a safe environment, which is a valid point, but doesn't directly relate to the friend's house. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision might be seen as inconsiderate and potentially discriminatory, even if they don't intend to be. They didn't address the daughter's feelings properly and their reasoning lacks concrete safety concerns. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong.\n"
