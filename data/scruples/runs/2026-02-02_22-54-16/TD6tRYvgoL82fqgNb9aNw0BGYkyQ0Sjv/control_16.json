My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the parent is wrong for not letting their daughter stay at her lesbian friend's house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent's daughter is 12 and friends with a girl who is lesbian. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then decided to stop the daughter from staying overnight there, leading to conflict. The parent claims they support the friend but don't want their daughter in an environment they consider unsafe. They also mention keeping their son away when the daughter is over, for safety.\n\nHmm, so the parent's reasoning is that the friend's home isn't a safe environment. But why? The friend's family celebrated her coming out, which could mean they are supportive, but the parent might be uncomfortable with the environment. However, the parent is also keeping their son away when the daughter is there, which might indicate more about the parent's own discomfort with co-ed sleepovers rather than the friend's sexuality.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's justification for the decision. If the real issue is the friend's family environment related to her sexuality, but there's no evidence of harm, then the parent might be in the wrong for not supporting their daughter's friendship. However, if there are actual safety concerns, like inappropriate behavior, the parent has a right to be cautious. But the parent doesn't mention any specific safety issues, just discomfort with the \"coming out\" party. The parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory, especially since they claim to support the friend's happiness. Also, the parent is making a distinction between their own home (keeping siblings separate) but not trusting the friend's home, which might be inconsistent. So, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety, making them in the wrong.\n"
