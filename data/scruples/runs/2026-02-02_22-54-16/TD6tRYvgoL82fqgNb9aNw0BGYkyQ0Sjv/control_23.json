My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter has been close with her friend since kindergarten, and the friend's family recently had a \"coming out\" party for the daughter. The author thinks the party was inappropriate because the friend is 12 and celebrating her sexuality. The author is not opposing the friend's sexual orientation but is concerned about the \"safe environment\" when their son is at home during overnight stays.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's decision to prohibit overnight visits. The friend's family is being celebrated for their daughter's sexuality, which the author finds \"trashy.\" However, the author claims they support the friend and her happiness but don't want their son present when the daughter is over. The author's rationale is about providing a safe environment, possibly to avoid the son and daughter being alone together.\n\nNow, I need to assess if this is a case of the author being in the wrong. The daughter is 12, so she's a minor, and parents have the right to set boundaries. However, the friend's family's choices (like the coming out party) might be part of the context. The author is making a decision based on their family's comfort, not necessarily the friend's family's choices. They're not cutting off the friendship entirely but just the overnight stays.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The author's justification for the \"safe environment\" might be a bit of a red herring. They mention that when the daughter stays over, the son is elsewhere. That seems like a standard precaution for parents with children of the opposite sex. However, the daughter's friend is a girl, so the son being away to ensure a safe environment might be a way to avoid having a male child in the house when their daughter is visiting another girl's home. This could be seen as unnecessary or even as an overreaction, especially given that the daughter and her friend are both girls.\n\nThe author's main problem is the perception that they're being intolerant because they're opposing the celebration of a child's sexuality. The author clarifies they support the friend's daughter, but the action is still seen as unsupportive. The key here is whether the decision is based on genuine safety concerns or other factors. The author claims it's about safety, but the reasoning might not hold up, as the daughter and her friend are both female, so the presence of the son might not pose a risk. The author's son is a male child, so the scenario might be different if the friend's daughter were male, but in this case, it's a same-gender friendship. Therefore, the author's concern about a \"safe environment\" might be unfounded or based on gender stereotypes.\n\nAdditionally, the coming out party is a point of contention. At 12, it's a young age for such a celebration, but the author's daughter's friend is openly lesbian, which is their personal choice. The author's discomfort with the celebration might influence their decision, making it seem like they're against supporting the friend's identity, even if they claim otherwise. The community's reaction is that the author is being intolerant, which adds to the perception problem.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents can set boundaries for their children, but the reasoning here might be seen as discriminatory or based on misunderstanding. The author is not forbidding the friendship but the overnight visits, which could be a reasonable boundary, but the reasoning is questionable. The author might be conflating their discomfort with the friend's family's actions with a need to protect their daughter, even though the daughter's friend is the same gender.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision is based on their personal discomfort rather than a legitimate safety concern. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not allowing the overnight stay, especially if the concern is more about their own biases than actual risks.\n"
