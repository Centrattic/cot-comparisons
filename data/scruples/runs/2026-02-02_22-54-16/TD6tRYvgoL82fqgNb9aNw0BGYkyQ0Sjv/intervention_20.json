My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house after attending a \"coming out\" party the friend's parents threw. The parent says they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment for their daughter. The parent also mentions they make their son leave the house when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the \"coming out\" party felt inappropriate for a 12-year-old, but they clarify they support the friend. The key point is their decision to restrict the sleepovers. The parent is concerned about safety, but how valid is that concern? The friend's parents hosted a party celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which the parent deemed a \"shit show.\" However, the parent isn't opposing the daughter's sexuality but is focused on the environment.\n\nIn terms of child safety, parents do have the right to set boundaries based on their own comfort, especially regarding where their child stays. However, the parent's reasoning might be seen as problematic because it's based on the friend's family's sexual orientation rather than any specific unsafety. The parent didn't provide a concrete example of danger, just a judgment about the party. This could be perceived as discriminatory, even if they claim support. The daughter's close friendship adds weight, as cutting off the sleepover might be seen as punishing the daughter for her friend's identity. \n\nLegally, parents can make such decisions, but socially, there's a strong emphasis on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and their families. The parent's actions might be seen as indirectly stigmatizing the friend's family by not allowing their daughter to stay there, even if the parent supports their friend's identity. The parent's own practice of moving their son when the daughter is over might be another layer\u2014using the same logic to protect their daughter from their son, which could be seen as normal, but when applied to the friend's family, it's viewed as discrimination. \n\nThe parent's statement about the friend's family not providing a safe environment without specific evidence could be the crux. If there's no real safety issue, the decision is based on personal discomfort with the family's expression of their child's sexuality. That could be considered in the wrong because it's not about actual safety but possibly prejudice. Also, the daughter's feelings and the social backlash the parent is facing might indicate that society views the parent's action as unjust. \n\nSo, the parent's intentions are to protect their child, but the method is based on a judgment that might be discriminatory. Even if the parent is well-meaning, the action could be seen as wrong because it's not based on actual safety but on their perception of the friend's family's choices. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The parent says they support the friend, so maybe they're not being intolerant, but the action still has a negative impact. It's a tricky case, but the lack of concrete safety concerns and the judgment on the party might tip it towards A.\n"
