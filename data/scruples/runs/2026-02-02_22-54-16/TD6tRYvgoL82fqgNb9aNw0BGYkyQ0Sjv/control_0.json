My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, even though they support the friend's sexuality. The parent also mentions they separate their own children when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasons. The parent says they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay over. The main argument is about safety. However, the parent doesn't explain what specific safety concerns they have. Maybe they think the friend's family is promoting inappropriate content or activities for a child? But the friend is 12, so a child as well. The parent's son is separated when the daughter is over, which might relate to sibling issues, but that's different from the friend's family.\n\nThe parent is accused of being intolerant, but they claim they support the friend's sexuality. The problem might be that the parent is conflating the child's sexual orientation with an unsafe environment. At 12, both the daughter and her friend are children, so the friend's family's orientation shouldn't inherently affect safety. Unless there are other factors, like the friend's family has inappropriate activities, but the parent hasn't mentioned that. \n\nAlso, the \"coming out party\" is mentioned as a reason the parent was uncomfortable. But the parent's issue might be with the celebration of a 12-year-old's sexuality, which could be seen as a misunderstanding. The parent is making a judgment based on their own views rather than the actual safety of the environment. \n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory if they are denying the daughter's social life based on the friend's family's sexual orientation. Since the parent hasn't provided a concrete safety issue, it's possible they are acting on prejudice, even if they don't realize it. The daughter's strong friendship is important, and restricting it without a valid reason might harm the child's feelings and social life. \n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. But unless there's a legitimate threat, it's hard to justify the decision. The parent's own actions (separating their son) might indicate their own family dynamics, but that doesn't relate to the friend's family. \n\nIn conclusion, without specific safety concerns, the parent's decision seems based on bias rather than actual danger. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong."
