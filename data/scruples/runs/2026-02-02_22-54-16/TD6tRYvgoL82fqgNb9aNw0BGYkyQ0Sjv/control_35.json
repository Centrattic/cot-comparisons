My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her friend's house because the friend is a lesbian. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The daughter is 12, and her best friend is also 12. They're very close. The friend's family had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then decided their daughter shouldn't stay over anymore. People are calling the parent intolerant, but they claim they support the friend and just want to ensure a safe environment.\n\nSo, the parent's main argument is that the friend's house isn't a safe environment for their daughter to stay. But why? The parent mentions that when their daughter stays over, their son is elsewhere. The parent's reasoning here is about safety, but it's not clear how the friend's sexuality relates to safety. Maybe the parent is uncomfortable with the friend's family's celebration, but the parent says they support the friend. \n\nThere's a possible double standard here. The parent's son is sent away when the daughter stays over, but the parent is worried about the friend's house. The parent might be projecting their own discomfort onto the friend's house being unsafe. Also, the parent didn't explain their reasoning to the daughter's friend's parents, which could be a problem. \n\nThe coming out party itself might have been a stressor for the parent, but celebrating a child's identity isn't inherently harmful. The parent's action seems based on personal beliefs rather than actual safety concerns. If there's no evidence the friend's house is unsafe, the parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. The key is whether the reason is valid. If the parent is acting out of genuine safety concerns, that's one thing, but if it's based on prejudice, that's another. The parent claims support, but actions don't align. The daughter feels betrayed, which could impact her social and emotional well-being.\n\nI think the parent is in the wrong because they're using a vague \"safety\" excuse to avoid the friend's sexuality, which is a form of discrimination. The parent hasn't provided a concrete safety issue, just discomfort with the celebration. The daughter is being punished for the friend's identity, which isn't acceptable. So the answer is A.\n"
