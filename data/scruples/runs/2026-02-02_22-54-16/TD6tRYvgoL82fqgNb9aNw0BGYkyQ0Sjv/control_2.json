My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment for the daughter. They mention that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. The parent claims this is about providing a safe space, not about the friend's sexuality. However, the parent also criticizes the \"coming out\" party as a \"shit show,\" suggesting discomfort with the celebration of the child's sexuality.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's decision is based on actual safety concerns or underlying prejudice. The parent hasn't provided specific evidence of a safety issue at the friend's house, like bullying, inappropriate behavior, or any concrete danger. The only stated reason is about the friend's family not being a safe environment, which is vague. \n\nThe parent also mentions supporting the friend's happiness, but the action of restricting the friendship might contradict that support. The daughter is young, and sleepovers are common for her age. The parent's concern about their own son's presence doesn't directly relate to the friend's safety unless there's an implication of the son's presence being a risk, which isn't explained.\n\nIn most cases, unless there are documented safety issues, parents shouldn't deny a child's social interactions based on the family's sexual orientation. The parent's reaction to the coming out party as \"trashy\" could indicate a bias that's influencing their decision. Therefore, the parent's actions might be inconsiderate and could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim to support the friend.\n"
