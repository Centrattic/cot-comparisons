My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent's 12-year-old daughter has a best friend who is a lesbian. The friend's parents had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent then decided not to allow their daughter to stay the night at the friend's house. The daughter is upset, and others are criticizing the parent as intolerant and unsupportive. The parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about safety, mentioning that when the daughter stays over, they arrange for their son to be elsewhere for safety reasons.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong. They think the author isn't, but want my opinion. I need to evaluate the reasoning here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parent's stated reasons. They don't disapprove of the friend's sexuality but are worried about the environment being safe. However, the parent's justification for not allowing the stay is based on the \"coming out\" party. The parent found the celebration of a 12-year-old's sexuality as inappropriate. But wait, the term \"coming out\" usually refers to someone revealing their non-heterosexual identity. At 12, that might be a sensitive time, but is a party celebrating it considered a \"shit show\"? That could be seen as judgmental. The parent's discomfort might stem from their own biases, even if they claim support.\n\nThe parent mentions that they make arrangements for their son when the daughter stays over. So their reasoning is about safety, but the trigger was the friend's family's party. Is there a valid safety concern here? The parent hasn't stated any specific risks like drugs, unsafe practices, or other dangers. The concern seems to be about the celebration itself, which might not be a legitimate safety issue. Instead, it could be a moral or comfort issue.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, and friends of that age often have sleepovers. Denying a sleepover because of the friend's family's celebration could be seen as discriminatory if there's no other safety issue. The parent is differentiating between their son's situation and the friend's, which might imply a bias against the friend's family based on their sexuality. The parent claims they support the friend, but the action could be interpreted as not supporting the family, which might affect the daughter's friendship.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's own behavior (sending their son elsewhere) is about safety, but they don't mention that as a reason for the friend's house. Instead, they focus on the \"coming out\" party. This inconsistency might suggest that the real reason is not safety but discomfort with the celebration.\n\nIn legal and ethical terms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if the concern is based on stereotypes or prejudice rather than actual safety, it could be problematic. The parent's statement that the party was a \"shit show\" indicates a negative judgment, which may not align with supporting the friend's identity. It's possible the parent is conflating their own discomfort with the celebration as a safety issue, which is not a valid reason to restrict the child's social interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while parents have the right to make decisions for their children's safety, the parent's reasoning here seems based on personal discomfort rather than concrete safety concerns. This could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support for the friend. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
