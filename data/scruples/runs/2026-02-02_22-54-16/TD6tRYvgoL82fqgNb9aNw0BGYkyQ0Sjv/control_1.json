My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent is refusing to let their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her friend are very close, but the parent found the friend's family's \"coming out\" party inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent claims they don't want to end the friendship but are concerned about the \"safe environment.\" They also mention that they make their son leave the house when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend's sexuality but don't want their daughter to stay over. The key point here is the parent's concern about a \"safe environment.\" But what's the actual danger they're referring to? Since the friend is a lesbian, unless there's a specific risk (like the family has a history of dangerous behavior, which isn't mentioned), the parent's concern might be based on stereotypes or misconceptions about LGBTQ+ families. \n\nThe \"coming out\" party being a surprise and the parent calling it a \"shit show\" suggests that the parent is uncomfortable with the celebration of the friend's sexuality at a young age. This could indicate homophobia or discomfort with the friend's identity, even if the parent claims support. The parent's refusal to allow the sleepover might be based on prejudice rather than a legitimate safety issue. \n\nAlso, the parent's own practices, like making their son leave the house when the daughter is staying over, might be about their own comfort rather than the daughter's safety. They mention they trust their son but want to ensure a safe environment. It's possible that the parent is applying different standards here when it comes to the friend's family. \n\nThe daughter is 12, which is a time when kids often have sleepovers. The parent's decision is affecting the daughter's friendship without a clear, concrete reason beyond the friend's sexuality. The parent's justification for safety might not hold up if there's no evidence that the friend's family is unsafe. \n\nIn terms of support, the parent says they support the girl and hope she's happy, but their actions are causing the daughter to feel abandoned and the parent to be seen as intolerant. Even if the parent's intention is to protect, the approach may be discriminatory. \n\nSo putting it all together, the parent's actions seem more based on bias rather than a legitimate safety concern. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong.\n"
