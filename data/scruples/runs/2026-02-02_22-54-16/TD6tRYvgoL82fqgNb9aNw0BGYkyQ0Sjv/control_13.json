My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who forbade their daughter from staying overnight at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the parent's daughter is 12, and her friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party. The parent finds this inappropriate for a 12-year-old, calling it a \"shit show\" and \"trashy.\" They then decided not to let their daughter stay over, leading to backlash where others think the parent is intolerant. The parent claims they support the friend and her family but feel the friend's home isn't a safe environment for an overnight stay. The parent also mentions they keep their son away when their daughter is over, ensuring a safe environment.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reasoning: they're concerned about safety when their daughter is at the friend's house. However, the friend's family is lesbian, which the parent seems to equate with a lack of safety. The parent didn't mention any specific risks or issues at the friend's house, just the \"coming out\" party. But the parent's son is also kept away during overnight visits, which suggests that it's more about the parent's comfort with overnight visits rather than the friend's family's sexuality. \n\nThe key here is whether the parent's decision is based on valid safety concerns or prejudice. If the parent is acting out of genuine concern for their daughter's safety (like if there are specific risks at the friend's house), that's different. But the parent's reasoning seems to hinge on the friend's family being lesbian, which is a form of bias. Also, the parent's son is kept away during their daughter's visits, implying that the issue isn't the friend's family's sexuality but rather the parent's approach to co-ed sleepovers. However, the parent attributes the problem to the friend's family's environment, which is a red herring. The parent might be conflating their own discomfort with the family's openness about their sexuality with a lack of safety, which is a common form of homophobia or transphobia. \n\nIn many cases, parents might have different rules about sleepovers, but when those rules are based on the other family's sexual orientation without any actual evidence of risk, it can be seen as discriminatory. The parent claims to support the friend and her family, but the action of forbidding overnight visits could be seen as not supporting the daughter's friendship, especially if the daughter is close to the friend. The parent might be acting out of fear or misunderstanding, but the action is harmful to the daughter's relationship and could be perceived as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent feels that their daughter's safety is at risk during overnight stays, they can make that decision. But in this case, the parent's reasoning doesn't seem to be based on actual safety concerns related to the friend's family's sexuality. The \"coming out\" party might have been a trigger for the parent's discomfort, leading them to make a decision based on bias rather than objective safety. \n\nSo, the parent's actions might be rooted in prejudice, even if they don't realize it. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for making a decision based on the friend's family's sexual orientation without valid safety concerns, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the parent truly believes that the environment isn't safe (even if others disagree), they might not be in the wrong from a strict legal standpoint, but socially and ethically, it's problematic. The answer hinges on whether the parent's decision is based on actual safety or prejudice.\n"
