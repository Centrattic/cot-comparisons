My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The situation is that the daughter's friend had a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent doesn't want their daughter to stay over, but they clarify they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. They mention they rearrange their son's activities when the daughter stays over, saying it's about providing a safe environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They might be concerned about the appropriateness of the coming out party given the child's age. However, the parent's decision is based on the perception that the friend's family isn't safe, which seems to be linked to the daughter's sexual orientation. That could be problematic. Even if the parent's intention is to ensure safety, if the underlying reason is related to the friend's identity, it might be seen as discrimination or being unsupportive. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, so she's a child, and her parents have the right to make decisions about her safety. But the parent's explanation might be conflating the friend's sexual orientation with the safety of the environment, which could be a misunderstanding or prejudice. The parent's own actions (keeping their son away) show they adjust their home for their daughter's visits, so maybe they're uncomfortable with their son being in a similar situation? \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the parent genuinely believes the friend's house isn't safe, maybe there's a valid reason. But the coming out party being a \"shit show\" and the parent's reaction suggest that their discomfort is based on the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety concerns. That would be where the problem lies. \n\nSo, the parent's decision is about safety, but if the safety concerns are not justified and are rooted in the friend's identity, that's where they might be in the wrong. The daughter's right to her social life and the friend's family's right to their own environment. The parent's support of the friend's happiness might be genuine, but the action of not allowing the sleepover could be seen as undermining that support by associating it with the friend's sexuality. \n\nTherefore, the parent's reasoning might be based on a bias, making them at fault. Answer A.\n"
