My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate. The parent claims they're not against the friendship but are concerned about a safe environment for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They support the friend and her sexuality but feel the environment isn't safe. Their justification is about providing a safe space, similar to how they separate their son when the daughter stays over. But is the \"coming out\" party a valid reason? At 12, the term \"coming out\" might be more about the family's celebration rather than the girl's own decision. The parent's discomfort with the party could stem from personal views on when and how to address a child's sexuality.\n\nAlso, the parent hasn't outright forbidden the friendship but the overnight stay. They might be conflating their own discomfort with potential risks. The key here is whether the parent's decision is based on genuine safety concerns or personal biases. If the friend's house is otherwise safe, the parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory. However, as a parent, they do have the right to set boundaries based on their values, even if others disagree.\n\nBut the parent's reasoning might not hold up if there's no evidence that the friend's home is unsafe. The \"coming out\" party itself doesn't inherently make the environment unsafe. The parent's argument about separating siblings for safety could be a red herring if the friend's house isn't comparable. The community's reaction that the parent is an \"intolerant\" asshole suggests that the parent's stance is not widely accepted, which might indicate that they are in the wrong, especially if the decision is based on prejudice rather than actual safety issues.\n\nHowever, the parent does mention supporting the friend's happiness, which complicates things. They're not opposing the friendship but the overnight stay due to their own safety standards. The question is whether those standards are reasonable. If the parent's son is separated during visits, maybe the friend's house isn't the only issue. But the friend's sexuality is being used as a justification here. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision might be rooted in personal discomfort rather than actual safety, which could make them wrong. However, parental rights allow for such decisions based on their values. The line is blurry, but since the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely and is making a choice based on their own safety measures, it's a gray area. But considering the context of the \"coming out\" party and the parent's explanation, they might be seen as in the wrong for using that as a reason to deny the sleepover.\n"
