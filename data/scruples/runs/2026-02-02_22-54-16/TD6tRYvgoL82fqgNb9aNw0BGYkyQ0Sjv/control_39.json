My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay over her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has a close friendship with her best friend, and the friend's family had a surprise \"coming out\" party for her. The parent finds this inappropriate for a 12-year-old and now doesn't want their daughter to stay overnight. They claim they support the friend but feel the environment isn't safe.\n\nHmm. The parent mentions they take precautions at home by moving their son elsewhere when the daughter stays over. They're not terminating the friendship, just the overnight stays. But they're getting criticized as intolerant. So the key points here are about the parent's reasoning and whether their actions are justified.\n\nI should consider the parent's perspective. They might feel uncomfortable with the public celebration of the friend's sexuality, thinking it's premature for a 12-year-old. However, the friend is openly lesbian, and the family is being supportive. The parent's decision could be perceived as discriminatory, even if they claim support. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is concerned about safety. They mention providing a safe environment, but their own reasoning about the friend's family not being safe is unclear. Maybe they think the friend's house isn't safe because of the family's open LGBTQ+ environment? That seems odd. Or perhaps they're worried about their son's presence affecting their daughter, but they handle that by sending their son away when the daughter stays over. \n\nThe parent says they don't want to allow overnight stays, but the daughter still can be friends. The problem is whether this decision is based on genuine safety concerns or prejudice. The parent's justification for the friend's house not being safe isn't explained well, which makes it look like they're using a pretext to avoid supporting their daughter's friend. \n\nAlso, the parent is getting backlash for being intolerant. If the friend's family is supportive and the parent is the one cutting off access without a clear safety issue, that might be seen as wrong. 12 is a young age, but kids can form close friendships regardless of their parents' views. \n\nI need to check if the parent's actions are reasonable. If there's no actual danger, like substance abuse, neglect, or anything in the friend's home, then it's about the parent's discomfort with the friend's sexuality. In that case, the parent might be in the wrong for discriminating. However, if the parent has legitimate concerns, but the way they expressed it (calling the party a \"shit show\") is judgmental, that's another issue.\n\nThe parent claims to support the friend, but their actions contradict that. Not allowing the daughter to stay over could hurt the daughter's feelings and damage trust. The daughter's well-being and social life are important. Unless there's a real safety risk, the parent's decision might be unjustified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's reasoning doesn't hold up. They didn't provide valid safety concerns, just personal discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of their daughter's sexuality. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because their actions are based on prejudice and not genuine safety issues.\n"
