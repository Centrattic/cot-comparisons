My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The situation is a bit complex. The daughter's friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. They said the party felt \"trashy\" and are now restricting overnight stays. The daughter is upset, and others think the author is intolerant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. At 12, parents still have the authority to make decisions about their child's safety. The author isn't opposing the friend's sexuality, they just don't want their daughter to sleep over there. The friend's family is celebrating their daughter's coming out, which is a significant and positive event for the child. The author's reasoning is about safety, not the friend's family's sexual orientation. They mention that they also make arrangements for their son, so maybe their concern is about managing family dynamics when the daughter is over. \n\nBut is the author's reasoning valid? The \"coming out\" party itself might not be a safety issue. However, the parent's perception of safety could be influenced by their own discomfort or societal pressures, even if there's no actual danger. The daughter values the friendship, and the parent's decision might be seen as undermining the daughter's autonomy. \n\nThe key points are: the parent supports the friend and their family, isn't ending the friendship, but is concerned about the environment. The question is whether the parent's decision is justified. Legally, parents have the right to set boundaries, but socially, there's a push for supporting children's friendships, especially when the friend's family is LGBTQ+. The parent's reasoning isn't based on the friend's sexuality but on the party and the environment. \n\nHowever, the parent's initial reaction to the party as a \"shit show\" and feeling it's \"trashy\" for a 12-year-old might indicate personal bias. If the party was actually unsafe (like involving alcohol, adults not supervising, etc.), then the parent's concern would be valid. But since the parent just found it inappropriate, maybe their judgment is clouded by their own views. \n\nAlso, the daughter is close to this friend, so restricting the friendship could affect her emotionally. The parent might need to communicate better, perhaps setting boundaries without cutting off the friendship entirely. \n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is to keep their daughter safe, but their reasoning seems to stem from personal discomfort rather than actual safety concerns. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the parent's concern is legitimate, but if it's based on prejudice, then A. The parent's own actions (making their son leave) might be similar, so maybe they're being inconsistent. But the main issue is the overnight stay, not the celebration itself. The parent could be overstepping by not trusting the friend's family, even if they support the friend. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because they're making a judgment based on the party rather than actual safety, and the daughter's friendship is important. The answer is A.\n"
