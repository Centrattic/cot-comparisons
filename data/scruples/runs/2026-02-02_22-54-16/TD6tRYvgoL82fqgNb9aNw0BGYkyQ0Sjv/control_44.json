My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the daughter and her best friend are very close since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent then decided their daughter can't stay there. The parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment when their daughter stays over. They also mention they make arrangements for their son to be elsewhere when their daughter is at their house, which they say is about safety, not mistrust.\n\nNow, the parent is getting backlash for being intolerant. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me think about possible angles. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety and well-being. The parent is not forbidding the friendship but just the overnight stays. They might have reasons related to privacy, maturity level of the children, or the environment they observed at the friend's house. The \"coming out\" party was a trigger for their decision, but the parent still claims support for the friend's identity.\n\nHowever, there's a possible issue with how the parent expressed their concerns. They might not have discussed the specific safety concerns with the other family, leading to misunderstandings. The parent's reasoning about their own house's arrangements (moving their son) is about their own household's safety, but applying that same logic to the friend's house might not be directly comparable unless there are specific issues at the friend's house. Without clear evidence of a safety risk, the parent's decision could be seen as overprotective or based on prejudice, especially if the friend's family is supportive and the environment is safe.\n\nThe parent's statement about the \"coming out\" party being a \"shit show\" might imply discomfort with the friend's sexuality, which could be perceived as intolerance. Even if they support the friend, the way they reacted might not consider the daughter's emotional needs and the importance of her friendship. At 12, sleepovers are common, and denying it without a clear, communicated reason might harm the daughter's trust.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries they feel are in their child's best interest. If the parent genuinely feels the environment is unsafe, even if others don't see it that way, they might be justified. However, the lack of specific safety issues mentioned and the reaction to the party could suggest the parent is projecting their own discomfort rather than actual dangers.\n\nSo, balancing the right to parent and the potential for appearing intolerant. The answer hinges on whether the parent's concerns are legitimate. If there's no evidence of unsafe conditions beyond the parent's subjective discomfort with the party, then the parent might be in the wrong. But if they have valid, specific safety concerns, they might not be. Since the scenario doesn't mention any specific safety issues at the friend's house beyond the parent's personal feelings about the party, it's possible the parent's decision is based on prejudice or misunderstanding, making them in the wrong. However, the parent also mentions they are trying to provide a safe environment, which is a valid parental duty. \n\nI think the key here is whether the parent's actions are based on legitimate safety concerns or personal discomfort. Since the parent didn't specify any safety issues beyond their own feelings about the party, and given the age of the children, it's more likely they are overstepping, thus being in the wrong. So the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
