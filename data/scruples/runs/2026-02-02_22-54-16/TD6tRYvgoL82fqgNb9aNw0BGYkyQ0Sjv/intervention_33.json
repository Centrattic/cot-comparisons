My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to sleep over at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter. The parent found it inappropriate because the girl is only 12 and thought the celebration was trashy. The parent didn't want the daughter to stay overnight but clarified they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. The parent also mentions they ensure their own son isn't home when the daughter is there, to keep the environment safe.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's decision is based on the belief that the friend's home isn't a safe environment, possibly due to the party. But the parent is accused of being intolerant. The parent claims support for the friend and her family but is concerned about the party's nature.\n\nI need to consider if the parent's reasoning is valid. At 12, children are entering adolescence, but a coming out party for a 12-year-old might be considered unusual or premature. The parent's discomfort might stem from the idea that the family is emphasizing the child's sexuality at such a young age, which could be seen as pressuring or labeling the child. However, the parent's stated concern is about the environment's safety. The parent might be conflating their discomfort with actual safety issues. The friend's family might not have done anything wrong, but the parent's judgment about the party's appropriateness is a personal opinion. \n\nAlso, the parent's own actions (moving their son when the daughter is over) suggest they prioritize a safe environment. But the parent isn't explaining the specific safety concerns about the friend's house. The parent's reasoning might be based on personal beliefs rather than concrete safety issues. In that case, the parent could be seen as being intolerant, even if they claim support. \n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to make decisions they deem necessary for their child's well-being. If the parent genuinely believes the environment isn't safe, even if based on personal discomfort, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the \"safety\" is a justification for not supporting the daughter's friend due to her sexuality, that would be problematic. The line between genuine safety concerns and prejudice is thin here. \n\nThe parent's decision to not allow the sleepover might be seen as discriminatory if there's no actual safety issue, even if they claim support. The community's reaction is that the parent is intolerant, which suggests that the parent's reasoning isn't aligned with societal norms in this context. \n\nSo, the parent's argument relies on the \"safe environment\" excuse, but without specific details, it's hard to take their concern as valid. The parent might be using that as a cover for their discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of sexuality. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong because their decision appears to be based on prejudice rather than legitimate safety concerns.\n"
