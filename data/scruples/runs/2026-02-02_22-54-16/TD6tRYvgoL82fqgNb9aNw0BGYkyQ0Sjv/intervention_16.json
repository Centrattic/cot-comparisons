My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to provide a \"safe environment\" when their daughter is at their home, which involves making sure their son is elsewhere. They also mention disliking the \"coming out\" party, thinking it was inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They claim to support the friend, just don't want the daughter to stay overnight. The parent mentions safety concerns, possibly related to their own son's presence, but that's when the daughter is at their home, not the friend's. So maybe the parent is uncomfortable with their son being home when the daughter is there, which might relate to their own beliefs about same-sex relationships. However, the parent allows the daughter to visit the friend's house during the day but not for the night. That seems inconsistent unless there's a specific safety issue at the friend's home, which hasn't been clearly stated here.\n\nThe parent's main argument is about the environment being unsafe. But the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's coming out, which is a supportive gesture. The parent's discomfort might stem from their own views on LGBTQ+ issues. However, keeping children away from a friend just because of their sexuality could be seen as discriminatory, even if the parent claims to support them. The parent is enforcing a rule that could be perceived as based on the friend's orientation rather than any actual risk to the daughter.\n\nAlso, the parent's justification about making their son leave when the daughter is at their house implies a possible discomfort with same-sex relationships. This could lead to the daughter feeling that her friend's sexuality is something they should be cautious around, which might affect her perception of acceptance. Even if the parent doesn't say they're ending the friendship, the action of not allowing overnight visits could damage the friendship and make the daughter feel unsupported.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children, but those boundaries shouldn't be based on discriminatory reasons. The parent's actions here might be seen as violating the child's right to social interactions without discrimination. The daughter is in a sensitive age where friendships are crucial, and denying her the chance to stay overnight at a friend's house based on the friend's sexuality could be harmful.\n\nHowever, the parent might argue that they have the right to make decisions for their child's safety. But the key here is whether the safety concern is legitimate. If there's no actual harm or unsafe behavior from the friend's family, the parent's decision is more about personal discomfort rather than a real threat. In that case, the parent is in the wrong because they're denying the daughter social opportunities based on prejudice, not actual safety.\n"
