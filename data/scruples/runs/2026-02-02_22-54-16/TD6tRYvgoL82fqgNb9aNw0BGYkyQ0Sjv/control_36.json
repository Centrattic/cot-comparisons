My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the daughter's friend had a \"coming out\" party. The parent thought it was a \"shit show\" and didn't like celebrating a child's sexuality at 12. But they say they support the girl and just don't want their daughter to stay over. The parent also mentions they separate their son when the daughter stays over, to ensure a safe environment. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about the parent's reasoning. They claim it's about safety, not about the friend being lesbian. But the friend's family is lesbian, so maybe the parent is concerned about exposing their daughter to LGBTQ+ lifestyles or environments they don't approve of. However, the parent says they don't oppose the friendship.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if the reason is based on the friend's sexual orientation and not actual safety concerns, it could be discriminatory. The parent mentions they make their son leave when the daughter is over, which is about creating a safe environment. But the same logic could apply to the friend's house. If the friend's parents are LGBTQ+, maybe the parent is uncomfortable with that and using safety as an excuse.\n\nAlso, the parent's comment about the \"coming out\" party being trashy might indicate personal bias. Even if they support the friend, their reaction could imply a judgment about celebrating sexuality at a young age. This could be seen as intolerant, especially in a society that generally supports LGBTQ+ youth's right to express their identity.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't forbidding the friendship itself, just the sleepovers. They might be prioritizing their daughter's comfort and their own values over their daughter's social life. But if there's no actual unsafe situation at the friend's house, the parent's decision could be based on prejudice rather than genuine safety. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If they're using safety as a cover for disapproval of the friend's family's sexuality, then yes. But if there are legitimate safety concerns (like the friend's house isn't a safe environment regardless of the parents' sexual orientation), then maybe not. The problem is the parent hasn't provided evidence of actual safety issues, just their own discomfort. Therefore, the parent's reasoning might be discriminatory, making them in the wrong.\n"
