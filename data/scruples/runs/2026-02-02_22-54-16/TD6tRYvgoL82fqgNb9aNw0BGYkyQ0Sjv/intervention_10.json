My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is a parent who decided not to let their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her best friend have been close since kindergarten. The friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The author says they don't want the friend's house to be a safe environment for their daughter, but they clarify they support the friend's sexuality and aren't cutting off the friendship. The author also mentions they keep their son away during sleepovers for their daughter's safety, not because they don't trust him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is concerned about the environment at the friend's house. The coming out party might have involved themes or activities that the parent finds unsuitable for a child. However, the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which is a part of her identity. The parent's decision is based on their perception of safety, but their reasoning isn't entirely clear. They mention \"safe environment\" but don't specify what exactly is unsafe. It could be related to the party's content, like adult themes, or perhaps they just feel uncomfortable with the situation.\n\nThe parent claims to support the friend's daughter, so it's not an issue of intolerance. However, the coming out party for a 12-year-old might imply that the friend's parents are exposing their child to adult topics earlier than the author would prefer. The parent is making a choice based on their own comfort level with the environment, even if it's not based on any actual harm.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and parenting approaches. Some might argue that the author is overstepping by not allowing the sleepover, especially if the friend's family is supportive and the activities are age-appropriate. On the other hand, parents do have the right to make decisions based on their perception of what's safe for their child. The author mentions that they also separate their children for other sleepovers, indicating it's a general policy rather than a targeted action.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The author is denying a sleepover based on the friend's family's celebration of their daughter's sexuality. Even if the author supports the friend's identity, the coming out party might have involved elements that the author finds inappropriate. However, the friend's family is celebrating their child's identity, which is a positive thing. The author's decision could be seen as imposing their own values on the friend's family without considering the child's need for social connections.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter is 12, an age where social relationships are crucial. The parent's action is causing the daughter to hate them, which might have a negative impact on the child. The parent's reasoning about safety isn't concrete, so others might see it as an excuse to avoid a situation they feel uncomfortable with.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's activities. However, if the friend's family is not engaging in any harmful activities, the author's decision could be seen as discriminatory, even if not intended. The parent's justification for safety might not hold up if there's no evidence of actual risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions are based on personal discomfort rather than actual safety concerns, which could be seen as inconsiderate towards the daughter's friendship and the friend's family's values. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But if the parent genuinely believes their child is in an unsafe environment, even if others disagree, they might not be in the wrong. However, the lack of specific safety reasons and the daughter's age being 12 (where coming out parties aren't uncommon in some contexts) might tip the balance towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
