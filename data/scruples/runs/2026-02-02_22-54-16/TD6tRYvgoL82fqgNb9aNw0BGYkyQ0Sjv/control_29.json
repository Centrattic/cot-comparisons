My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent deciding not to allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent explains that they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's home isn't a safe environment for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They mention that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter, which they found inappropriate. They think it's too early to celebrate a child's sexuality and that the party was a \"shit show.\" The parent's main concern is safety, stating that when their daughter stays over, their son is elsewhere. They clarify that they don't want to end the friendship but feel the environment isn't safe.\n\nNow, the parent is being criticized as intolerant and unsupportive. The question is whether they're wrong. Let's break down the key points. The parent supports the friend, so it's not about the friend's sexuality. The issue is about the environment. The parent is prioritizing their daughter's safety, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the friend's family might argue that their home is safe and that the parent is overstepping.\n\nBut wait, what's the legal age for such decisions? In most places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's safety and associations. At 12, the child isn't old enough to make such decisions independently. The parent's reasoning is based on their judgment of the environment, not the friend's sexuality. However, the parent's daughter is upset, and others are criticizing the parent. But the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely; the daughter can still visit the friend during the day. The parent is focusing on overnight stays, which might be about managing potential risks, like inappropriate exposure or situations that a parent might want to avoid for a young child.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's family might feel discriminated against, even if the parent claims it's not about their sexuality. The parent's daughter's friend being lesbian might not affect the safety per se, but the parent's decision could be seen as not trusting the friend's family. However, the parent's main point is about the environment, not the family's sexual orientation. The parent also mentions they take precautions at home when their son is present, showing they're proactive about safety.\n\nAnother angle: celebrating a child's sexuality at 12 might be controversial. Some might argue it's premature, while others see it as supportive. The parent's discomfort with the party could be a contributing factor to their decision, but they're not the ones who organized it. The parent's stance is that the environment isn't safe for an overnight stay, which is a judgment call. As a parent, they have the right to set boundaries based on their assessment of risks.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents do have the authority to restrict their children's activities for safety reasons. The parent isn't forbidding the friendship but limiting specific aspects of it. So, unless there's evidence that the friend's home is unsafe (like actual risks such as substance abuse, neglect, etc.), the parent's decision might be seen as overprotective but not necessarily wrong. They\u2019re using their discretion to protect their daughter, which is a common parental role.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent is making a judgment based on stereotypes or misunderstanding the situation. If the friend's family is open about their sexuality in a way that's age-appropriate and the parent is concerned without valid reasons, it could be seen as discrimination. But the parent claims it's about safety, not the family's orientation.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision is based on their perception of safety, which is within their rights as a parent. Unless there's concrete evidence of danger, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
