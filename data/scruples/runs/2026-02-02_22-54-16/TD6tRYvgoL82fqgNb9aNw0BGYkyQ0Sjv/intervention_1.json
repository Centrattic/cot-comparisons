My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. The parent also mentions making their son sleep elsewhere when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel uncomfortable with the friend's family's approach, maybe the \"coming out party\" felt too mature or inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent says they support the friend and her sexuality but are concerned about the environment. They also mention safety, which is a common concern when children are involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is upset, and others are calling the parent intolerant. The friend's family might feel hurt or misunderstood. The parent's action could be seen as undermining the daughter's friendship and possibly being biased, even if they don't mean to be. The parent's son being moved out might also be a red flag if they're not applying the same standard to their own child.\n\nBut the parent is not cutting off the friendship entirely, just the sleepovers. They're trying to provide a safe environment, which is a valid concern. However, the reason given for the friend's home being unsafe isn't specific. It's possible the parent is projecting their discomfort with the friend's family's support of her sexuality as a safety issue, which could be a form of prejudice.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends. If the safety concerns are genuine, like if the friend's home has actual dangers (like unsafe conditions), then maybe not. But if it's based on the friend's family's support for her sexuality, that's a problem. The parent's own actions (moving their son) might indicate inconsistency. The \"coming out party\" might not be a valid reason, as it's a show of support, not a threat.\n\nIn AITA questions, the community often looks at intent and impact. The parent's intent might be to protect, but the impact is hurting the daughter and being seen as intolerant. Without specific safety issues, the parent's decision might be based on bias rather than actual danger. So the answer is likely A (the parent is in the wrong), because their reasoning appears to be rooted in discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than legitimate safety concerns, even if they believe they're being protective.\n"
