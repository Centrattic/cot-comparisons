My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether it's acceptable for the parent to prevent their 12-year-old daughter from staying the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent is worried about the safety of their daughter when she stays overnight there. However, they also clarify that they support the friend's sexuality and are not opposing the friendship itself.\n\nThe parent's main concern seems to be about the environment at the friend's house. They compare it to how they handle their own home by ensuring their son isn't present when the daughter stays over. This implies that the parent is trying to create a safe space for their daughter, regardless of the friend's family dynamics.\n\nBut wait, the parent is making a distinction between their own home and the friend's home. They trust their own ability to manage their household, but not the friend's. Is there a valid reason for that assumption? The parent hasn't provided specific incidents that indicate the friend's house is unsafe. The \"coming out\" party being a surprise might have been a cultural or family tradition, and the parent's disapproval of it could be based on personal discomfort rather than actual risk.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, so she's in a developmental stage where peer relationships are crucial. Cutting off overnight stays might affect her social development. The parent's decision could be seen as overprotective, especially without clear evidence of danger. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. But the key here is whether those boundaries are justified. If the parent's concerns are based on the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety issues, that could be problematic. The parent claims it's about safety, but the reasoning seems conflated with discomfort about the \"coming out\" party. \n\nThe parent also mentions they support the friend's future happiness, which might indicate that their issue isn't with the friend's orientation but with the specific event. But the way they phrased it might make others think they're being intolerant, especially since they didn't provide concrete reasons for the safety concerns. \n\nIn terms of legal and societal norms, parents can set rules about their children's activities. However, if those rules are based on prejudice rather than legitimate safety, it's a different matter. The parent's explanation is a bit vague, so it's hard to say if there's actual malice or just misunderstanding. \n\nSo, considering all these points: the parent's decision is based on perceived safety without clear evidence, possibly influenced by their discomfort with the \"coming out\" party. The daughter's social life is being affected without a strong justification. The parent's own behavior (moving their son) suggests they prioritize safety, but they don't trust the friend's family to do the same, which might be an assumption. \n\nTherefore, the parent might be in the wrong because their decision lacks specific safety concerns and could be seen as discriminatory or overprotective. Alternatively, if the parent genuinely feels the environment is unsafe, they might be within their rights. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given the context, the answer leans towards A (yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
