My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent mentions that their daughter is 12 and very close friends with her best friend. The friend's parents had a \"coming out\" party for the daughter, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then decided to stop allowing their daughter to stay overnight at her friend's house, leading to conflict. \n\nThe parent explains that their issue isn't with the friend's sexuality but with ensuring a safe environment. They mention that when their daughter stays overnight, they arrange for their son to be elsewhere, not out of distrust but for safety. \n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is about safety concerns, not the friend's sexual orientation. But how does that hold up? At 12, kids often have sleepovers, and the parent's decision seems to be based on their discomfort with the \"coming out\" party, which they found trashy. However, the parent claims it's not about intolerance but about safety.\n\nBut does the parent have valid reasons for safety? They don't provide specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe. The argument is that they can't guarantee a safe environment, but that's vague. Maybe they're projecting their discomfort onto the friend's home environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter. However, without specific safety concerns, it might come off as prejudiced, even if they don't intend it. The friend's family had a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate, but that's a personal choice of the friend's parents, not necessarily a safety issue for the daughter. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is a bit conflicting. They say they support the friend's happiness but are concerned about safety. If the friend's family is supportive and the environment is safe, then the parent's concern might be unfounded. The parent's action could be seen as not supporting their daughter's friendship, even if they think they're acting out of safety. \n\nIn terms of societal context, supporting a child's friendships, especially in middle school, is important. The parent's decision might be seen as overprotective or even discriminatory, even if they don't mean it to be. The daughter is likely feeling hurt because her parent is cutting off a close friend without clear justification. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's reasoning is based on a vague safety concern without concrete evidence, which might not be valid. Therefore, they could be in the wrong. But if the parent genuinely believes the environment is unsafe, even if others don't, it's a tough call. However, the lack of specific safety issues points more towards the parent's discomfort with the \"coming out\" party, which might not be a legitimate reason.\n"
