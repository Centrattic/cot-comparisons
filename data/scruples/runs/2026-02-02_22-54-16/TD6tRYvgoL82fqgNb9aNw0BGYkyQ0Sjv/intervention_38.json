My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who refused their 12-year-old daughter from staying overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but is concerned about the safety of their daughter during an overnight stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they don't want the friend's house to be a safe environment for their daughter. They also say they make sure their son isn't around when the friend is over. The parent isn't against the friendship or the friend's sexuality but is making a decision about overnight stays. \n\nThe daughter is 12, so in the US, that's a common age for such social activities, but parents have the right to set boundaries. However, the parent's argument about safety might be questionable. They didn't provide specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe, just their discomfort with the \"coming out\" party. The parent could be projecting their own discomfort onto a safety concern. Also, the daughter is upset and others think the parent is being intolerant. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to make decisions for their children's safety. But is the parent's reasoning valid here? If there's no concrete evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, just a subjective feeling, then the parent might be overstepping. The parent's own actions (making sure their son isn't around) might suggest that the real issue is discomfort with same-sex relationships, which could be a form of bias. \n\nSo, the parent's stated reason is safety, but the underlying issue might be intolerance, even if they claim to be supportive. The key is whether the safety concern is legitimate. Without specific safety issues, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice, making them the asshole. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the parent is in the wrong because their decision is likely rooted in intolerance rather than a valid safety concern.\n"
