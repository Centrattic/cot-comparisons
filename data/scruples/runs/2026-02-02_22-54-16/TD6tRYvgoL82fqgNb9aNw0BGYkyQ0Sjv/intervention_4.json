My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The author mentions that they support the friend and her sexuality, but they feel the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment for their daughter. They also mention that when the daughter is at their house, their son is elsewhere for safety.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The friend's family hosted a coming out party for their daughter, which the author found inappropriate. The author's reasoning is that the friend's family isn't safe, but the son is allowed to stay elsewhere. So, is the author being biased or is there a valid safety concern?\n\nThe author claims they support the friend and her family but are concerned about the environment. However, the coming out party was at the friend's house, and the author is now restricting the daughter's sleepovers there. The son's sleepovers are managed by the author's brother or friends, which might be a way to control safety. But if the author is okay with their son staying at other places, why not the daughter's friend's house? Maybe the author is uncomfortable with the friend's sexuality and is using \"safety\" as an excuse. That could be a form of discrimination. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, which is a young age, and the parent's role is to make decisions they believe are best for their child. But the parent's reasoning might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety risks. The friend's family might be as safe as any other, and the coming out party doesn't necessarily indicate a dangerous environment. The parent's actions could be seen as supporting the belief that LGBTQ+ spaces are unsafe, which isn't fair. \n\nOn the other hand, if there are legitimate safety concerns, like the environment is inappropriate for a 12-year-old, the parent might have a point. But the story doesn't mention any specific unsafe behavior beyond the coming out party. The parent is using a general feeling of the party being a \"shit show\" as the reason, which is more about judgment than safety. \n\nSo, the parent is probably in the wrong because they're making a decision based on the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety. Even if they support the friend, their action of not allowing the sleepover could be seen as discriminatory. The real issue is the parent's discomfort with the celebration of the friend's sexuality, which is not acceptable. The son's sleepovers being moved are for safety, but the daughter's is because of the friend's family's orientation, which is a different reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
