My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her friend's house after the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party. The parent thinks it's inappropriate because the kid is 12 and celebrating sexuality at that age feels trashy. The parent says they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay over there anymore. They also mention that when the daughter stays over, they make their son leave the house to ensure safety, not because they don't trust him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They don't feel the friend's house is a safe environment for their daughter. But why do they think that? The main reason given is the \"coming out\" party. The parent might be conflating the celebration of a friend's sexuality with something inappropriate for a 12-year-old. However, the friend is a lesbian, and the party is to support her identity. The parent's discomfort could stem from personal beliefs or societal norms, but at 12, kids might not be deeply into the complexities of sexuality yet, but some kids might explore their identity earlier.\n\nThe parent says they support the friend, so maybe they're not against the friend being gay, but the party itself made them uncomfortable. However, refusing to allow an overnights could be seen as discriminatory if the reason is solely based on the friend's sexuality. The parent's argument about safety is a bit confusing because they don't explain what makes the friend's home unsafe. They mention their own home's safety measures, which involve moving their son, but that's a different scenario. \n\nThe daughter is upset and others think the parent is intolerant. The parent claims they're not ending the friendship, just the sleepovers. But the daughter might feel like the friendship is being undermined. The key issue is whether the parent's decision is justified by actual safety concerns or based on personal discomfort with the friend's family's actions. If there's no concrete evidence that the friend's home is unsafe, the parent's reasoning might be biased or based on stereotypes. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety, but if those boundaries are based on prejudice, it's problematic. The parent's support of the friend's happiness but refusal to let their daughter stay over could be seen as contradictory. Also, the \"coming out\" party itself isn't inherently unsafe. The parent's justification for safety isn't clearly explained, so it's possible they're using that as an excuse for their discomfort. \n\nConsidering all that, the parent might be acting on personal bias rather than a real safety threat. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). However, if there's a legitimate safety reason, the parent isn't in the wrong. But since the parent hasn't provided any specific safety concerns beyond the party, it's more likely based on their discomfort, making them wrong.\n"
