My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the daughter and her friend are very close since kindergarten. The friend's family had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The author then stopped allowing their daughter to stay over. People are criticizing them as intolerant, but the author says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. The reasoning is about ensuring a safe environment, similar to when their son stays over, they have him elsewhere.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the age of the children and the author's concern about safety. The author isn't opposing the friend's sexuality but is worried about the appropriateness of a coming out party for a 12-year-old and the safety of their daughter staying over. However, same-sex relationships or identities in minors aren't inherently unsafe. The author's comparison to moving their son when others stay over might imply they're applying different standards. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions they ensure a safe environment regardless of the guest's gender, which they do by sending their son elsewhere. So maybe their concern isn't about the friend's sexuality but about the general safety of overnight stays. However, the coming out party might have made the author uncomfortable, leading to the decision. \n\nLegally and socially, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, the author's reasoning might be seen as conflating the friend's sexuality with the safety of the environment. It's possible that the author is using the coming out party as a justification for a decision based on other factors, like discomfort with a same-sex coming out party for a preteen. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust in the friend's family. The author might not trust the friend's parents to provide a safe environment, but they haven't provided specific reasons other than the coming out party. It's possible they're making an assumption based on the friend's sexual orientation rather than any concrete safety concerns. \n\nIn terms of supporting the daughter's friendship, the author might be misunderstanding the significance of the coming out party. For many, coming out is an important step, and a supportive family environment is crucial for a child's well-being. The author's reaction could be seen as not supporting the friend's family, even if they claim to support the friend. \n\nHowever, the author is not cutting off the friendship, just the overnight stays. They might have legitimate concerns about their daughter being in a house where such a party happened. But is that a valid reason? If the friend's family is supportive and the environment is safe, the coming out party alone shouldn't be a barrier. The author's decision might stem from personal discomfort rather than actual risk. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reasoning is questionable. They might be conflating the friend's sexuality with the safety of the environment, which isn't a valid connection. The decision could be seen as discriminatory, even if their intention is to protect their daughter. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
