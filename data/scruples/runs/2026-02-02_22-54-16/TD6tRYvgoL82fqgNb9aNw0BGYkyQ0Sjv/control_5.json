My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter and her best friend are very close since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the friend, which the author finds inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The author then told their daughter they don't want her to stay over anymore. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant. The parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's home isn't safe for their daughter to stay in, hence making their son leave the house when the daughter is over.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's reasoning for the decision, the daughter's age, the context of the party, and the parent's concern about a \"safe environment.\"\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend's sexuality but are worried about the safety of their daughter. However, the friend's family threw a coming out party, which the parent found trashy. The parent's own action is to prevent sleepovers at that house. The parent also mentions that they ensure their son isn't present when the daughter is over, which might be about avoiding co-ed situations or other safety concerns.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and child safety. At 12, kids are entering adolescence. Parents have different comfort levels regarding where their children stay. However, the reason given by the parent is about the \"safe environment\" at the friend's house. The parent doesn't specify what exactly is unsafe\u2014maybe the party's content, the family's handling of the situation, or other factors. But the parent's own son is sent away when the daughter is over, which might indicate a preference for same-gender environments, which could be a red flag if it's based on stereotypes or homophobia.\n\nThe parent is accused of being intolerant, but they claim they support the friend's sexuality. However, the act of not allowing the daughter to stay over might still be seen as discriminatory if the real issue is the friend's sexuality. The \"safe environment\" argument could be a cover for discomfort with the friend's family's open celebration of their child's sexuality. The parent might be conflating their own discomfort with the party as a lack of safety, which isn't necessarily valid. \n\nAlso, the parent didn't approach the situation by discussing with the friend's parents to address any actual safety concerns. Instead, they unilaterally decided, which might not be the best approach for a 12-year-old's social life. The daughter's reaction and the perception of others suggest that the parent's decision is seen as unsupportive.\n\nIn terms of the law, in most places, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety. However, the issue here is more about social tolerance and support. The parent's reasoning might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. The fact that the parent is sending their son away when the daughter is over could imply a double standard, possibly influenced by the parent's views on the friend's sexuality.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's decision could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they claim support for the friend. The lack of specific safety concerns and the potential for underlying bias might make the parent the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
