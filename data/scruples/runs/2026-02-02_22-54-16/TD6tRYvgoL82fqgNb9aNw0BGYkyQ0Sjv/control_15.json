My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did the wrong thing by not letting their daughter stay over her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter is 12 and very close to her best friend. The friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party, which the writer found inappropriate. They think that celebrating a child's sexuality at 12 is a \"shit show\" and \"trashy\". Then, the writer told their daughter she can't stay over anymore, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the writer's reasoning. They say they don't think the friend's house is safe for their daughter now. But why? They mention their own practice of making their son stay elsewhere when the daughter has overnight guests. So the writer is using safety as a reason, but maybe they're actually uncomfortable with the friend's sexuality?\n\nThe writer claims support for the friend, hoping she finds happiness, but the action seems contradictory. Not allowing the daughter to stay over could be seen as a form of exclusion or not supporting the friend's family. The writer says they didn't end the friendship, just the sleepovers. However, sleepovers are a significant part of the friendship for kids that age. \n\nAlso, the \"coming out\" party might have triggered the writer's discomfort. The term \"coming out\" usually applies to adults, but the friend is a child. The writer's reaction could stem from misunderstanding or prejudice, thinking that discussing sexuality at a young age is inappropriate. But the parents are celebrating their child's identity, which is a positive thing. \n\nIs the writer's decision based on genuine safety concerns or bias? The writer hasn't provided specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe, like unsafe conditions or behavior. The comparison to their own practice of moving their son suggests they have a policy about privacy, but maybe they apply it inconsistently. \n\nIn terms of supporting LGBTQ+ youth, being accepting is important. The writer's public stance is supportive, but the action of cutting off sleepovers could be seen as not fully supporting the friend's family. The daughter is upset, and others think the writer is intolerant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's reasoning seems more about personal discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than a legitimate safety issue. Therefore, the writer is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
