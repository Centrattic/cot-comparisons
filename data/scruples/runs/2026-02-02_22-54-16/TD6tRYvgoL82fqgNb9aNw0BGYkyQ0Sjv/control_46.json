My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent is getting criticized for being intolerant and unsupportive, but they claim they support the friend and just don't want to risk a \"safe environment\" for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the friend, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent is concerned about the safety of their daughter, not the son, so they make sure the son is elsewhere when the daughter is home. The parent says they trust the son but want to ensure a safe environment. \n\nBut wait, how does the friend's sexual orientation affect the safety? The parent is making a judgment based on the friend's sexuality, which might be discriminatory. The parent claims they support the friend and their family but is still restricting their daughter's sleepovers. The friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which is a positive thing. The parent might be conflating the friend's identity with some inherent risk, which isn't logical. \n\nAlso, the parent's own actions (making their son leave when their daughter is over) might not be relevant to the friend's family's situation. The parent's decision could be based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. The daughter is upset and everyone thinks the parent is being intolerant. The parent's justification for safety might be a cover for discomfort with the friend's sexuality. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to set boundaries, but if those boundaries are based on discriminatory beliefs, they might be in the wrong. The parent is not cutting off the friendship but just the sleepovers, which is a different issue. However, the parent's reasoning seems to stem from a lack of acceptance of the friend's sexuality, which is problematic. \n\nIn many places, it's considered wrong to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation, even if it's a minor. The parent's actions could be seen as teaching the daughter to be intolerant. The parent might need to address their own biases and recognize that the friend's family is just as capable of providing a safe environment as any other family. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's actions are based on prejudice against the friend's sexuality, which makes them wrong. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
