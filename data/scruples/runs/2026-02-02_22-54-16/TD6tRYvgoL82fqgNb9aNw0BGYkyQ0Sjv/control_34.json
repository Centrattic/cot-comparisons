My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if the parent is wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her friend are really close, kindergarten through now. The friend's family had a \"coming out\" party for the daughter. The parent thought it was inappropriate and now they're restricting overnight stays. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent says they support the friend and her family but don't want the daughter to stay over. The parent also mentions making their son leave the house when the daughter stays there to ensure a safe environment.\n\nHmm, so the parent's main reason is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. But they never specified what exactly is unsafe. The parent also mentions they do the same when the daughter is over by making their son leave. That seems like they're creating a safe environment in their own home. But the friend's family is being accused of not providing a safe environment. But the parent doesn't explain why. Maybe they think the environment is inappropriate because of the \"coming out\" party? The parent found the party trashy and thought celebrating a 12-year-old's sexuality was wrong. But the parent still supports the friend and her family.\n\nWait, the parent says they don't want to terminate the friendship. They just don't want the daughter to stay overnight. But other people are calling them intolerant. So the parent is in a tricky spot. The key issue here is whether the parent's decision is justified. If the parent has no specific reason other than disapproving of the friend's sexuality, then they might be in the wrong. But if there's a legitimate safety concern, maybe not. However, the parent hasn't provided any concrete safety issues\u2014they just say the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. The parent's own actions when their daughter is over (sending their son away) seem to be about ensuring privacy and maybe avoiding awkwardness, but that's their own choice. \n\nThe problem is that the parent is making a judgment about the friend's home safety based on the party they found inappropriate. But the party was a coming out party, which is a way to support the friend. The parent might be conflating their personal discomfort with the friend's family's expression of support with safety. If there's no actual evidence that the friend's home is unsafe, then the parent's decision could be based on prejudice or misunderstanding, which would make them wrong. On the other hand, if the parent genuinely believes that the environment is unsafe for their child, even if that belief is based on their values, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut since the parent acknowledges they support the friend and her family, maybe the real issue is their discomfort with the coming out aspect. They might be projecting their own feelings onto the safety of the environment. Also, the daughter is close friends with this person, so cutting off overnight visits could be seen as a punishment for the friend's sexuality, which would be discriminatory. The parent's reasoning seems to lack specific safety concerns, so it's possible that the parent is in the wrong by not allowing the daughter to stay over without a valid reason, especially if it's based on prejudice rather than actual danger.\n"
