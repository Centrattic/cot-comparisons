My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate. They don't want their daughter staying over because they think the environment isn't safe, even though they support the friend's sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they want to ensure a safe environment. But their reasoning is based on the friend's family's celebration of being lesbian. The parent also mentions they keep their son away when their daughter is over their house, implying they're okay with that arrangement. \n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's activities, especially regarding overnight stays. But the ethical question is whether their reasoning is valid. The parent is conflating the friend's family's celebration with a lack of safety. The daughter's friend is 12, so the party might have been a family event to support her. The parent's concern about safety isn't explained\u2014it's not clear why the friend's house would be unsafe. \n\nAlso, the parent's actions might be seen as discriminatory. They claim to support the friend but are making a decision based on her family's expression of support for her daughter's sexuality. This could be viewed as intolerance, even if the parent doesn't see it that way. The daughter is being punished for the friend's family's actions, which might not directly impact her safety. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to be cautious. But without concrete evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, it's more about the parent's discomfort with the family's celebration. So, the parent's decision could be seen as unjustified discrimination, making them in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
