My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has been friends with her best friend since kindergarten. The friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter, which the author found inappropriate. The author then told their daughter she can't stay over anymore, leading to backlash where people think they're intolerant. The author says they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's home isn't a safe environment for an overnight stay. The author also mentions they keep their son away when the daughter is over their house to ensure a safe environment.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. The main issue here is about parental decisions regarding their child's safety and social life. The author's reasoning is about safety, not the friend's sexuality. However, the timing after the coming out party might be where the problem lies. The author's daughter is 12, which is a young age, and parents often have concerns about where their children are. The author isn't cutting off the friendship entirely, just the overnight stays. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author's decision is justified. The author's stated reason is the friend's home not being safe. However, the coming out party might have triggered this decision. There's a possibility that the author's discomfort with the celebration of a child's sexuality is influencing their judgment, even if they claim support. The friend's family might be supportive and safe, so the author's refusal could be based on personal bias rather than actual safety concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the author genuinely believes the environment isn't safe, they might not be in the wrong. However, the lack of specific safety issues mentioned (like any incidents or reasons why the environment is unsafe) could suggest that the decision is more about personal discomfort with the coming out party rather than legitimate safety. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, and parents might have different views on when to allow overnight stays. The author's reasoning about their son being away when the daughter is over might relate to sibling dynamics, but that's separate from the friend's family's practices. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, being a parent who doesn't allow a child's friend over because of their sexuality could be seen as discriminatory, but the author claims it's about safety. The challenge is determining if the safety concern is valid. Without concrete examples, it's hard to judge. However, the timing after the coming out party might imply that the author is conflating support for the friend with the celebration. \n\nIn conclusion, it's possible the author is being overly cautious or allowing their personal discomfort to affect their judgment, which could make them the asshole. But if they genuinely believe the environment isn't safe, they might not be wrong. However, since there's no evidence provided for the unsafe environment, the decision could be based on prejudice, which would make the author wrong.\n"
