My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is about safety, specifically mentioning that when their daughter stays over, the son is elsewhere. They support the friend but feel the friend's environment isn't safe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about co-ed sleeping arrangements, even if the friend's family is supportive of their daughter's friend. But the daughter's friend is a girl, so the friend's house might have other children or siblings? Wait, the parent says they move their son when the daughter is over, implying they have a son. So maybe the friend's house has boys? The parent didn't specify, but their reasoning is that the friend's environment can't guarantee safety. However, the daughter's friend is 12 and lesbian, so the friend's parents might be in a same-sex relationship. The parent might be uncomfortable with that, but they claim they support the friend.\n\nBut the parent's justification is about safety. However, the friend's house is the one with a same-sex parent, so maybe the parent is conflating their own discomfort with the friend's family structure with the safety of their daughter. The parent's own house has a son, so they manage that by sending him away. If the friend's house has a similar setup (maybe a same-sex parent and another parent, or other siblings), the parent might be making a biased judgment. The parent could be projecting their own discomfort with the friend's family's sexuality onto the safety aspect, which is a common issue with homophobia or transphobia.\n\nAlso, the parent's daughter is 12, and the friend's \"coming out\" party was thrown by her parents. The parent thinks it's a \"shit show\" and questions celebrating a child's sexuality. That suggests the parent might have conservative views on sexuality, which could influence their decision. The parent claims they support the friend, but their actions are limiting the daughter's social life based on the friend's family's orientation.\n\nLegally, parents can set boundaries for their children's social interactions, but the reasoning here might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. If there's no evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, then the parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory. The parent is not opposing the friendship itself, but the environment, which might be a cover for their own biases. The daughter's right to maintain a friendship and the friend's family's right to live openly might be more important than the parent's disapproval. So the parent is likely in the wrong here.\n"
