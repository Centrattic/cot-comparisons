My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's main reasons are that they didn't like the \"coming out\" party which they thought was inappropriate for a 12-year-old and they're concerned about safety, even though they mention they don't trust their son but keep him elsewhere when the friend is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent and societal norms. In many places, 12 is very young for any kind of sexual activity, so the \"coming out\" party might be about the friend being gay, but the parent is upset about celebrating sexuality at such a young age. However, being lesbian isn't something that requires a party in itself\u2014it's about identity, not an action. The parent's reaction could be seen as misunderstanding the friend's experience, which might make them seem unsupportive.\n\nThe parent says they support the friend's happiness but don't want the daughter to stay over. They mention safety concerns but don't specify what's unsafe. That's a bit vague. Maybe the parent is using safety as a reason but the real issue is discomfort with the friend's sexuality. If the parent is okay with the friendship but not the sleepovers, that could be a problem. They might be overstepping by not trusting the friend's parents, especially if there's no concrete reason for that distrust.\n\nAlso, the daughter's age is important. At 12, parents have a lot of control, but cutting off a best friend might affect her emotionally. The parent should consider the daughter's feelings and maybe find a middle ground, like allowing visits but not overnight stays, or discussing their concerns with the friend's parents. The fact that the parent didn't provide specific safety issues but just a general discomfort might lead others to think they're being biased. \n\nSo, the parent's actions could be seen as not supporting their daughter's close friend, which might hurt the daughter. However, the parent's intention to create a safe environment is understandable, but their reasoning might not be valid. The answer might hinge on whether the safety concern is legitimate or a cover for homophobia. The parent claims not to be intolerant, but their actions might contradict that. The key is whether the parent's decision is based on real safety issues or personal discomfort. Since there's no specific incident mentioned, it's likely the latter, making the parent in the wrong.\n"
