My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent supports the friend but feels the environment isn't safe for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, same-sex relationships are legal and protected, so discrimination based on sexual orientation is not acceptable. However, the parent isn't necessarily opposing the friend's sexuality but is concerned about the party. The parent mentions not trusting the friend's home as a safe environment. But the parent doesn't elaborate on specific safety concerns, like abuse or neglect. Instead, they focus on the coming out party.\n\nThe parent's reasoning might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual safety issues. Forcing the daughter to stay away from her friend could be seen as undermining the child's autonomy and potentially isolating her. However, the parent is within their rights to set boundaries for their child's safety. But if there's no evidence of danger, it's more about the parent's values conflicting with the friend's family. The parent also mentions their own practices, like making their son leave when the daughter stays over, which might indicate a different standard for their own family but not necessarily the friend's.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's decision is based on genuine safety concerns or personal bias. If there are no actual safety risks, then the parent's decision might be discriminatory. On the other hand, parents do have the right to make decisions they believe protect their children, even if they're criticized for it. However, the parent's statement about the party being a \"shit show\" and \"trashy\" shows a negative judgment towards the celebration of the friend's identity, which could be seen as intolerant.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting a child's friend's identity is important for the child's emotional well-being. The parent claims to support the friend's happiness but is restricting their daughter's friendship. This might be seen as not fully supporting the friend's family. The daughter's feelings are also a factor\u2014being cut off from a close friend can affect her social development.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might not be in the wrong legally, but socially and emotionally, they could be harming their daughter and the friend's family. The answer might depend on the specific reasons for the safety concerns. But since the parent didn't provide concrete safety issues beyond personal discomfort with the party, it's more about personal bias. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for making a judgment based on the friend's sexuality and not allowing the friendship to continue without a valid safety reason.\n"
