My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the parent's main reason is that they think the friend's house isn't a safe environment. They mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. They clarify they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the \"coming out\" party being inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nHmm. The parent's explanation about safety seems a bit odd. They don't provide specific reasons why the friend's house isn't safe. Maybe they're using safety as an excuse? Because the daughter is allowed to visit during the day but not stay over. The parent also says they support the friend's happiness but don't trust the environment when it's just the two kids.\n\nThe daughter is 12, so in some places, parents might be cautious about overnight visits, especially if they're not familiar with the other home. But the parent's reasoning here might come off as judgmental. They mention the coming out party felt \"trashy,\" which could imply they're uncomfortable with the friend's sexuality, even if they say they support her. That might be the real issue.\n\nAlso, the parent is making a distinction based on the friend's sexuality, even though they claim it's not about that. If they had the same concerns without the friend being LGBTQ+, would they have the same issue? Maybe not. The parent is using safety as a justification, but there's no evidence provided. So others might see this as an overreaction or a way to avoid supporting their daughter's friend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of their daughter's feelings and possibly biased against the friend's sexuality, even if they claim not to be. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
