My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to provide a safe environment when their son is around, but they mentioned they do that at their own house by sending their son elsewhere. The parent supports the friend but feels the friend's home isn't safe for an overnight stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age here. In most places, 12 is a minor, so parental discretion is usually allowed. However, the parent's justification is about safety. The friend's family is celebrating their daughter's coming out, which the parent finds inappropriate. But the parent isn't cutting off the friendship; they just don't want overnights. The parent also mentions they take similar precautions at home by sending their son away when the daughter has friends over. \n\nNow, the parent's concern might be about other people's perceptions. They feel judged as intolerant, but they claim to support the friend's sexuality. The main issue seems to be about safety, but the parent hasn't provided specific reasons why the friend's home is unsafe. It's possible the parent is making an assumption based on the friend's sexuality, which could be discriminatory. However, if there are other factors (like other children in the house, etc.), but the parent hasn't mentioned them. \n\nIf the parent is basing their decision solely on the friend's sexuality without any concrete safety concerns, that could be a problem. But if they have genuine safety measures they're upholding, like separating siblings, it's about their own standards. The key is whether the decision is based on prejudice or legitimate safety. The parent's own actions (sending their son away at their home) might be consistent, but the friend's family might not do the same, leading to the parent's decision. \n\nHowever, the friend is 12, so the parent's control over their daughter's activities is within their rights. But if the decision is perceived as discriminatory, even if it's not legally wrong, it might be considered morally wrong. The parent's reasoning is a bit conflicting: supporting the friend's sexuality but not allowing overnights. \n\nIn conclusion, without clear safety issues, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice, making them in the wrong. But if they have valid safety protocols, maybe not. However, the parent hasn't given specific reasons beyond their own comfort, which could be subjective. So the answer is likely A, the parent is in the wrong because the decision seems discriminatory without concrete safety concerns.\n"
