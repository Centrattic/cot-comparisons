My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. They're saying they don't trust the friend's house to be a safe environment for an overnight stay, but they still support the friend's sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They're concerned about the \"coming out\" party being a bad idea for a 12-year-old. However, supporting a child's identity is different from celebrating it. Maybe the party was more of a family event, but the parent might not understand the significance or the context. The parent also mentions safety, comparing it to how they arrange for their son to stay elsewhere when the daughter is over. That part about their son is interesting because it's about creating a safe environment for their daughter, so why the discrepancy here?\n\nThe parent claims they didn't terminate the friendship. But the daughter is now upset because she's not allowed to stay over. The parent's support seems conditional on the environment, not the friend's sexuality. But the parent's explanation might be perceived as discriminatory, even if that's not their intention. The key issue here is whether the parent's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or if it's a subtle form of bias.\n\nAlso, considering that the daughter is 12, parents have some discretion regarding their children's activities. However, denying an overnight stay solely based on the friend's family's sexual orientation could be seen as discriminatory. The parent's reasoning about the party being a \"shit show\" might indicate discomfort with the friend's identity, leading to an overreaction. The safety concern is vague\u2014what exactly makes the friend's house unsafe? If the parent can't specify, it might be a proxy for other biases.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, in many places, discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited. Even if not legally, socially, supporting a child's friend while making exceptions based on their family's identity could be seen as wrong. The parent's actions might harm the daughter's feelings and the friendship, even if their intent was to create a safe space. The comparison to how they handle their son's presence isn't directly relevant here, as the situations are different.\n\nSo, the parent's decision could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory, even if they claim support for the friend. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because their reasoning lacks specific safety concerns and seems to stem from discomfort with the friend's sexuality.\n"
