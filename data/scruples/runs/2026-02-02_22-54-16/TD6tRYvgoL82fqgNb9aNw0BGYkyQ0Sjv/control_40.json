My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has a close friend since kindergarten, and they're best friends. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the friend. The parent found this inappropriate and decided to stop the overnight stays. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but feels the friend's house isn't a safe environment now. They also mention making sure their son stays elsewhere when the daughter stays overnight, which they do for safety.\n\nHmm. So the parent's reasoning is about safety. But is there a legitimate reason here? The friend is 12, so their parents might be celebrating their daughter's coming out. The parent might be uncomfortable with the celebration's tone or the idea of a child's sexuality at such a young age. But is that a valid reason to cut off the friendship?\n\nThe parent says they don't want to terminate the friendship, just the overnight stays. But the daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. But the parent claims it's about safety. However, there's no mention of any actual unsafe incidents. The parent might be projecting their discomfort onto the environment. Also, the parent's own precautions (moving their son) might be similar to the friend's house situation if they're worried about same-sex interactions.\n\nLegally and socially, parents have the right to set boundaries, but if they're making decisions based on prejudice rather than genuine safety concerns, that's problematic. The parent claims support but their actions could be seen as discriminatory if there's no real safety issue. Unless there's a specific risk, the decision could be based on the parent's personal beliefs about sexuality, which isn't a valid reason to restrict a child's social life. So the parent might be in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
