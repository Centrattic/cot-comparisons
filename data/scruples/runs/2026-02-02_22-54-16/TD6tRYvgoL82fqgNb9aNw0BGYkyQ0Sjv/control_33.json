My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not letting their daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for her 12-year-old daughter, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but feels the environment is unsafe for their daughter when she stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend's happiness but are concerned about safety. The parent also mentions they make their son leave when the daughter is over, which is to ensure a safe environment. So they're applying similar logic but only in one direction. That might be a point of criticism. The parent is okay with their son being away when their daughter is at their house, but not the other way around. That could be seen as inconsistent. \n\nAlso, the parent is making a judgment about the friend's home environment based on the coming out party. At 12 years old, a coming out party could be a big event for the family to show support. But the parent is worried about the environment being \"trashy.\" That term is pretty judgmental. The parent might be overreacting to the celebration, assuming it's inappropriate without knowing the specifics. They might not have discussed their concerns with the friend's parents, which could be a way to address safety issues without cutting off the friendship.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's feelings. She's in a very close friendship, and the parent's decision is causing her to hate them. The parent claims they aren't against the friendship, but the action of not allowing sleepovers is affecting that bond. The parent might be prioritizing their own discomfort over their daughter's emotional well-being.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern about safety is valid. Parents do worry about their kids' safety when they stay over friends' houses. But the parent's reasoning seems more about the friend's family's lifestyle rather than specific safety issues. If there were actual safety concerns, like inappropriate content or behavior at the party, that's different. But the parent's issue is more about the celebration of sexuality, which could be a personal bias rather than a genuine threat.\n\nSo, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice or misunderstanding rather than actual safety. They're not allowing the sleepover due to the friend's sexual orientation, which is a form of discrimination. Supporting someone's identity doesn't mean you have to endorse all aspects of their environment, but making decisions based on stereotypes is problematic. The parent might be in the wrong for letting their own discomfort affect their daughter's friendship without addressing the safety concerns through open communication with the other family.\n"
