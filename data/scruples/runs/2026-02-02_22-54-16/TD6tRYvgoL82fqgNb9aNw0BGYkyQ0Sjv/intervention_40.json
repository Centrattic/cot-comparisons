My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The scenario is that the daughter and her best friend are 12 years old and very close. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate, leading them to decide against overnight stays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention that the party seemed \"trashy\" and that they don't trust the friend's house as a safe environment for their daughter. They also clarify that they support the friend's sexuality and aren't ending the friendship, just the overnight stays. The key here is the author's justification for their decision, which is based on safety concerns, not hostility towards the friend's sexuality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. It's important to note that the friend is 12 years old, so the \"coming out\" party might be more about the parents showing support rather than the child identifying as lesbian. However, the parent's reaction could be seen as judgmental, especially if the friend's family is LGBTQ+ and the celebration is a positive expression of support. The parent's decision to restrict the daughter's visits might be perceived as not accepting the friend's family, which could affect the daughter's feelings and social life.\n\nThe parent's argument about safety is crucial. They mention that when the daughter stays over, they ensure their son is elsewhere. This suggests that the parent is concerned about privacy or other safety issues. However, the parent doesn't provide specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe, which might lead others to question the validity of that claim. Without concrete evidence, the decision could be seen as an overreaction or based on prejudice, even if that's not the intention.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's age. At 12, children are forming strong friendships, and limiting their social interactions can have emotional impacts. The parent's decision might be causing the daughter to feel isolated or misunderstood, which could damage the parent-child relationship. The parent's stated support for the friend's happiness contrasts with their actions, which might confuse the daughter.\n\nLegal and societal norms also come into play. Parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety, but public perception might judge them harshly if the reasons aren't clear. The parent's explanation that they don't want to terminate the friendship but just the overnight stays is a point in their favor, showing they aren't against the friendship per se.\n\nIn summary, the parent's actions are based on a safety concern, but the lack of specific details about the unsafe environment might lead others to view the decision as prejudiced. The parent's support for the friend's well-being is stated, but actions can speak louder than words. The complexity here is balancing a parent's duty to protect their child with the need to support the child's social and emotional needs, as well as respecting the friend's family.\n"
