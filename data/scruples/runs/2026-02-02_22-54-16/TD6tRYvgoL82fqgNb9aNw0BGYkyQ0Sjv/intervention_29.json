My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay over her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning involves the friend's family environment not being safe, but they mention they do similar things for their own son. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the parent says they support the friend's sexuality, so that's a positive point. But the main issue is the \"safe environment.\" The parent mentions that when their daughter stays over, they make their son stay elsewhere. So they're applying a similar rule at home. But why is the friend's house suddenly unsafe? Maybe the parent feels uncomfortable because of the \"coming out\" party, thinking it's inappropriate for a 12-year-old. But is that a valid reason to restrict the friendship?\n\nAlso, the parent didn't mention any specific safety concerns about the friend's household. It's possible they're making a judgment based on the party's celebration of sexuality, which might be a personal discomfort rather than an actual risk. That could be seen as discriminatory, especially if there's no evidence of the friend's family being unsafe. The parent is separating their own child to ensure a safe environment but not considering the friend's home as equally safe. That inconsistency might be the issue.\n\nLegally, as long as the friend's parents are providing a safe environment, the parent can't unilaterally decide based on sexuality. Socially, supporting a child's friendships includes respecting their friends' families unless there's a proven safety issue. The parent's actions might be perceived as intolerant, even if their intentions are to create a safe space for their daughter. So while the parent might have concerns, acting on assumptions without evidence could be wrong.\n"
