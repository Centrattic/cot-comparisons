My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who said their daughter can't stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter, which they found inappropriate. They also say they want to ensure a safe environment for their daughter and that they separate their son when she's over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They claim support for the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the party. The parent's main point is about safety, not the friend's orientation. However, the parent's statement about the party being a \"shit show\" might imply a judgment on the celebration of the friend's identity, which could be seen as discriminatory, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe parent's decision to not allow the sleepover could be viewed as a safety measure, but they haven't provided specific reasons why the friend's home is unsafe. It's possible they're projecting their discomfort with the party onto the friend's home environment. Since the daughter is 12, parental decisions are usually based on their perception of safety. But if the parent's reasoning is based on stigma or misunderstanding around the friend's sexuality, that's where they might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they take steps to ensure their own home is safe by sending their son away. If they're doing that, they might be more protective, but that doesn't necessarily justify their decision regarding the friend's home. The key is whether the friend's home is actually unsafe, which the parent hasn't specified. Without concrete evidence, the parent's decision might stem from bias rather than actual risk.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if those boundaries are based on prejudice, they can be problematic. The parent claims support for the friend's happiness but seems uncomfortable with the celebration of her identity, which might not align with true support.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning might be more about their own discomfort with the \"coming out\" party than the friend's sexuality itself. However, the way they expressed it could be seen as dismissive or judgmental. The answer hinges on whether the parent's concerns are valid or if they're using safety as a cover for intolerance.\n"
