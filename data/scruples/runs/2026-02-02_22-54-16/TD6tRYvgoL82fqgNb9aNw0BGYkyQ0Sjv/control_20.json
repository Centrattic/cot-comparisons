My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The key points here are the parent's reasoning and the potential impact on the daughter and the friend's family.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter's friend. The parent finds this inappropriate, calling it a \"shit show\" and questioning why a child's sexuality is being celebrated. The parent then decided to stop overnight stays at the friend's house, leading to the daughter's resentment and others labeling the parent as intolerant.\n\nThe parent claims they still support the friend and hope she finds happiness. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, they ensure their son is elsewhere, not out of distrust but safety. The parent's main argument is about the environment not being safe for their daughter. \n\nNow, considering the age of the children, 12 is a young age, and parental decisions about safety are often based on their judgment. However, the parent's reasoning here might be problematic. The \"coming out\" party might be a sensitive event, but is it a reason to restrict the friendship? The parent is making a judgment based on their perception of the event rather than any actual danger. The parent mentions not trusting the friend's family's environment, but doesn't specify any concrete safety concerns\u2014like unsafe practices, neglect, or something specific. Instead, they focus on the celebration of the daughter's sexuality, which could be seen as a judgment against the friend's family's approach to their child's identity.\n\nThe parent's concern might stem from personal discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety. The parent's own actions (ensuring their son is away when the daughter stays over) show that they prioritize creating a safe space for their daughter, but they're not applying the same logic here. They might be projecting their own values onto the situation, possibly violating the daughter's right to choose her friends and social environment, especially as the daughter is entering her teenage years.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting a child's friend who is LGBTQ+ is generally seen as positive. The parent's decision could be perceived as discriminatory, even if they claim support. The daughter's emotional well-being and the impact of the parent's decision on her friendships are significant factors. The parent's justification might not hold up if there are no actual safety issues, just personal discomfort or misunderstanding of the friend's family's actions.\n\nThe parent's argument that they \"don't want to expose their daughter to a certain environment\" could be considered a form of imposing their values, which might not be the child's responsibility. The daughter's right to form friendships and experience different family dynamics is important for her social development. The parent's actions might prevent the daughter from understanding and accepting diverse lifestyles, which is a counter to what is typically considered supportive parenting.\n\nIn conclusion, while parents have the right to make decisions based on their judgment of their child's safety, the lack of concrete safety concerns in this scenario and the potential for the parent's own biases to influence the decision suggest that the parent might be in the wrong. The decision could harm the daughter's relationship with her friend and be seen as discriminatory, even if the parent claims to support the friend.\n"
