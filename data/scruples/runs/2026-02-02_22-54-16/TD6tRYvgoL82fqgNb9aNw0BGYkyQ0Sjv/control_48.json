My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who's denying their 12-year-old daughter from staying over at her best friend's house because the friend is part of a lesbian family. The friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter and her friend are very close since kindergarten. The friend's family had a coming out party, which the author found trashy. The author doesn't want the daughter to stay over, but supports the friend's sexuality in general. The author also mentions keeping their son away when the daughter is over, for safety, which might relate to gender segregation or personal comfort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal and general societal perspective, in many places, it's considered important to support children's friendships, especially if they're close. The coming out party itself isn't illegal, but the parent's reaction might be seen as discriminatory. The parent is making a decision based on the friend's family's sexual orientation, which could be seen as prejudice, even if they claim support. \n\nHowever, the parent mentions \"safe environment,\" which could imply concerns about the other family's environment. But the daughter is 12, and the parent is making a judgment about safety based on the celebration of the friend's identity. This could be overstepping, as the parent might be projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. \n\nThe parent also says they don't want the daughter to stay over, but the friend's family isn't mentioned to have any other issues. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant. The parent's reasoning might not hold up if there's no actual danger. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. But if the safety concern is based on prejudice rather than actual risk, then it's problematic. The parent's justification about safety might be a cover for disapproval of the friend's family's sexuality. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're denying the friendship based on the family's sexual orientation and a coming out party, which is a personal choice and not inherently unsafe. The parent's actions may be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
