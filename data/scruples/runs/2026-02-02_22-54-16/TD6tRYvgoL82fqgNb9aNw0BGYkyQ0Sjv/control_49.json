My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding not to allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The key points here are the parent's reasoning and the context provided.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent is concerned about the environment being unsafe, even though they clarify they're not opposing the friend's sexuality. The parent also mentions taking precautions at their own home by keeping the son away during overnight stays, which suggests they have some safety measures in place. \n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legal age for certain activities isn't an issue here since the children are 12. However, parental discretion plays a big role. The parent is not forbidding the friendship but the overnight stay. The parent's concern might be about the environment's appropriateness for a child's age, especially if the party was seen as overly adult or if there were activities that a 12-year-old shouldn't be involved in.\n\nBut then again, the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which is a personal choice. The parent might be conflating support for the friend's identity with an environment that's unsuitable for a child. The parent's reasoning about safety is vague\u2014what exactly makes the environment unsafe isn't clear. If there's no concrete evidence of danger, it could be seen as the parent imposing their own discomfort onto their daughter's social life.\n\nAlso, considering child welfare, friends over the same age often have sleepovers, which are common. The parent's decision could be seen as isolating the daughter unnecessarily, especially since the daughter is upset and others are criticizing the parent. The parent might be projecting their own feelings about the friend's sexuality onto the situation, even though they claim to support the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to make decisions they believe are in their child's best interest. If the parent genuinely feels the environment isn't safe, even if others disagree, they might not be in the wrong. However, without clear evidence of danger beyond the party, it's more about personal values rather than actual safety.\n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong because the decision is based on personal discomfort rather than a real safety issue, and it's affecting the daughter's social life without a valid reason. The answer would be A.\n"
