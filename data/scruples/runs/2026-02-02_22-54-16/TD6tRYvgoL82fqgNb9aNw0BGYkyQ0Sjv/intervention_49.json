My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is about ensuring a safe environment, referencing that they separate their children when they have overnight guests. The daughter's friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points here. The parent's stance is that they support the friend's sexuality but feel the friend's home isn't safe for an overnight stay. They mention they do the same with their son, keeping him away when others stay over. So, the parent isn't opposing the friendship but wants to manage the environment.\n\nNow, considering the parent's concern about safety. Safety can be subjective. If the parent believes that the friend's house isn't suitable for an overnight stay, maybe due to other factors (like the presence of other people, activities they don't agree with, or just personal comfort), they might be acting on that belief. However, the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party. While the parent finds it \"trashy,\" it's a celebration of identity, which is a positive thing. The parent's judgment here could be based on personal discomfort rather than actual safety issues.\n\nThe parent mentions they don't want to be seen as intolerant, but their actions could be perceived as such. Supporting someone's identity means respecting their choices, including their family's expression of that identity. By denying the sleepover, the parent might be sending a message that the friend's family isn't acceptable, which could hurt the daughter's feelings and strain the friendship. \n\nAlso, the parent's justification about providing a safe environment is a bit conflicting. They mention separating their son during sleepovers, implying that their own home is safe, but they don't apply the same logic to the friend's home. If the friend's home isn't inherently unsafe, the parent's decision could be based on prejudice against the friend's sexuality, even if they think they're being supportive.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, the daughter might feel her parent is being unfair, especially if the sleepover was important for her friendship. The parent's actions might undermine the daughter's trust and make her feel that her friend's family isn't valued. It's possible the parent didn't communicate the reasons clearly, leading the daughter to feel rejected.\n\nIn terms of societal views, promoting inclusivity and supporting friends of different backgrounds is generally encouraged. The parent's stance might be seen as discriminatory, even if their intention was to provide a safe space. The key question here is whether the safety concerns are legitimate or based on personal bias. If the friend's home is safe in other aspects, the parent's decision could be unjustified.\n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. The problem is if those boundaries are based on prejudice rather than actual risks. Since the parent didn't provide specific safety concerns (like the presence of substances or inappropriate activities), the decision might stem from disapproval of the friend's family's expression, which is a form of intolerance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent might believe they're acting in their child's best interest, the decision to deny the sleepover appears to be influenced by discomfort with the friend's sexuality and the friend's family's celebration, rather than genuine safety issues. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not supporting their daughter's friendship and sending a message of intolerance, even if their intention wasn't malicious.\n"
