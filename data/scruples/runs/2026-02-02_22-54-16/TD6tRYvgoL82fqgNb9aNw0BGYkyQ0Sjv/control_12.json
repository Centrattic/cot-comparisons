My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who prohibited their 12-year-old daughter from staying overnight at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, looking at the parent's reasoning: they think the friend's house isn't a safe environment for their daughter. They mention that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son isn't home. The parent isn't opposing the friend's sexuality but is concerned about safety. \n\nBut wait, the friend is 12 too, right? The parent is worried about the environment at the friend's home, possibly due to the \"coming out party\" which they found inappropriate. The parent might feel that the atmosphere is not suitable for their daughter's safety, but is that a valid reason? \n\nNow, the daughter is close to her friend, and the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely. They just don't want the overnight stays. The parent's stance is about providing a safe environment, referencing their own actions when the daughter is over. \n\nHowever, the child is 12, and parents do have the right to set boundaries regarding their children's safety. But the parent's reasoning might be based on personal discomfort with the friend's sexuality or the party, which could be a bias. \n\nThe key here is whether the parent's decision is based on genuine safety concerns or prejudice. The parent says they support the friend's happiness but still don't trust the environment. If the friend's parents are supportive and the home is safe, the parent's objection might be unfounded. \n\nAlso, the parent's own action of keeping their son away when the daughter is over suggests they are concerned about privacy for the daughter, not the son. But the issue here is the friend's home. \n\nI think the parent's decision is based on potential bias rather than concrete safety issues. The parent isn't providing specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe beyond the party. So, the parent might be in the wrong by denying the daughter's wishes without valid cause, which could be seen as discriminatory or unsupportive, even if they claim otherwise.\n"
