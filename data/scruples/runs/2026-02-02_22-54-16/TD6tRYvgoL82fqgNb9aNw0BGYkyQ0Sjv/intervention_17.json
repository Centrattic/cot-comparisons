My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who wrote this is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the daughter and her friend are best friends since kindergarten and are inseparable. The parents threw a \"coming out\" party for the friend, which the author found inappropriate because the girl is only 12. The parent then decided not to let their daughter stay over anymore, leading to the daughter hating the parent and others calling them intolerant. The parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the safety of their son when the daughter is over.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's reasoning. They don't oppose the friendship but are worried about their son's safety when the daughter is at the friend's house. They mention that when the daughter is over their house, they make sure the son is elsewhere. So the parent is trying to create a safe environment, not because of the friend's sexuality but possibly because they know the daughter is a girl and want to avoid any potential awkward situations with their son, maybe to prevent any possible inappropriate interactions, or just to respect their son's privacy. But the parent didn't explain this reasoning to others, so people are misunderstanding them as being against the friendship or the friend's sexuality.\n\nBut wait, the friend is a girl, so the daughter is staying over at a girl's house. The parent is male with a son. The parent's son is in the same house when the daughter is over, but the parent keeps the son away when the daughter is at their house. The parent is doing this for the daughter's safety? Or maybe they're trying to avoid any potential situations where the son might be in the same house as the daughter during sleepovers, perhaps to avoid possible molestation or just to maintain privacy. But the parent's friend's house has a daughter staying over with her parents, so maybe the parent is uncomfortable with the idea of their son being in the same house as the friend's daughter? But the friend is a girl, so the parent's son and the friend's daughter are both kids. Maybe the parent is overcautious.\n\nBut the problem here is the perception. The parent is being accused of being intolerant because they stopped the sleepovers after the coming out party. However, the parent clarifies that their support isn't about the friend's sexuality but about safety. But since the friend is a girl, the parent is making a decision based on their son's presence. That seems a bit odd because if the friend's parents have a daughter, then the parent's son would be with the friend's daughter as well. Unless the parent is concerned about same-sex interactions between their son and the friend's daughter, but that's not clear. The parent hasn't explained this reasoning to others, leading people to think it's about the friend's sexuality.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is about safety, but their actions might be misinterpreted. Are they in the wrong? If their reason is genuinely about safety and not about the friend's sexuality, then maybe not. However, the parent is making a decision that affects the daughter's friendship without explaining the real reason. The daughter is 12, so she's in middle school, and parents do have the right to set boundaries. But the parent's explanation isn't clear. The parent says they don't want the friend's house to be a safe environment, but the friend's house is with the friend's parents, so unless there's something else unsafe there, the parent's reasoning is unclear. The parent mentions the coming out party as a trigger, but that's the child's personal choice, and the parent's issue is with celebrating a child's sexuality. \n\nSo, the parent is being judged harshly but claims they're not against the friendship. The real issue is about safety. However, if the friend's house isn't inherently unsafe, then the parent's decision might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual danger. The parent might be in the wrong if their concerns are unfounded or based on prejudice. But if their concerns are genuine (like the son's behavior or something else), they might not be in the wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The parent didn't provide enough information to the public, so the judgment is unfair, but their reasoning might still be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's reasoning is about safety, but the way they handled it might be wrong because they didn't communicate their actual concerns, leading others to think they're intolerant. But if their concerns are genuine and unrelated to the friend's sexuality, they might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that they're making a decision based on their son's presence when the daughter is at the friend's house might be misguided, as the friend's house has the friend's parents present. Maybe the parent is being overprotective, but not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
