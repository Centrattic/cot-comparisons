My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their daughter stay at her friend's house after the friend's family threw a \"coming out party.\" The daughter is 12, and the friend is also 12 and identifies as lesbian.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the party felt inappropriate. They supported the friend but thought celebrating a 12-year-old's sexuality was a \"shit show.\" Then, they decided their daughter can't stay overnight there anymore. The friend's family is now seen as not providing a safe environment because they might have other kids over (the author's son is kept away when the daughter stays at their house).\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's reasoning. They claim they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay overnight because of safety concerns. But their son is kept away when the daughter stays at their house. So they're applying the same logic there. However, the difference is the friend's family is a same-sex couple.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is being biased or applying different standards based on the friend's family structure. The author says they don't want the friend's family to have a safe environment for their daughter, which might be a red flag. If the author is worried about other children being present, maybe the real issue is the presence of the friend's parents' same-sex relationship, which the author finds uncomfortable. But the author claims they just want a safe environment for their daughter.\n\nIn many places, same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a safe environment as any other family. The author's decision might be based on prejudice under the guise of safety. If the author is making a distinction without a valid reason related to safety, then it's discriminatory. However, if they have specific safety concerns (like the friend's parents are inappropriate, have other kids over, etc.), but since they don't mention that, it's unclear. The fact that they apply the same rule to their son when the daughter is over suggests the problem is the friend's family structure.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because they're applying different standards based on the friend's family being a same-sex couple, which is not a valid reason for denying the daughter to stay over.\n"
