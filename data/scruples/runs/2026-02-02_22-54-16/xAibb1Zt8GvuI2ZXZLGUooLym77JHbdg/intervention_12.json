They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their dog was attacked by a neighbor's dog.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the user's small dog. The first time, the user pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog was on top of their dog, so the user kicked it to get it off and then threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor only said sorry but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again.\n\nThe user's main concern is whether their reaction was justified. They feel they might have overreacted but are unsure. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, protecting one's property (including pets) is generally allowed, but the method used matters. Kicking a dog could be seen as excessive force depending on the circumstances. However, the neighbor's dog was attacking their own pet, which could be a legitimate threat to the user's animal's safety. The user's response was to stop the immediate danger. \n\nThe neighbor's lack of action\u2014like not securing their dog\u2014might contribute to the problem. If the neighbor didn't take responsibility, the user might feel justified in taking defensive measures. However, threatening to kill the dog might cross a line, even if it's in self-defense for their pet.\n\nEmotionally, the user was shaken and acted out of fear for their dog's life. The neighbor's apathy could have escalated the situation. But the user's actions, especially the threat, could lead to legal issues. However, considering the dog's aggressive behavior and the neighbor's inaction, the user's response might be seen as a necessary defense.\n\nBalancing these factors, while the user might have acted in self-defense, the specific actions (kicking the dog and making threats) could be seen as over the line. But if the dog was actively attacking their pet, it's a gray area. The answer depends on the jurisdiction, but generally, protecting one's pet from an imminent threat is a valid reason. However, the method and threats could be problematic. But since the user was defending their dog, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
