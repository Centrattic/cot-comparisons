They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about their dog being attacked by a neighbor's dog, and the writer threatened to call animal control or kill the dog after the second incident. They also told the neighbor to do something about trespassing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbor's dog, a large mix, jumped the wall twice and attacked the writer's smaller dog. The first time, the writer tried to pull the dog off. The second time, when the dog had their dog's neck, the writer kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatened the neighbor about the dog and trespassing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, the owner is responsible for their dog's behavior. If the dog is a threat, the owner should take measures like leashing it. The writer acted to protect their own dog, which could be seen as justifiable self-defense for the pet. However, threatening to kill the dog might be problematic. While defending one's pet is understandable, using lethal force could be over the line unless there's immediate danger again.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also an issue. They didn't take steps to control their dog, which was dangerous. But the writer's response after the second attack\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014might be considered excessive. Kicking an animal is not a typical method of defense and could be seen as cruel. The threat of killing the dog might be taken seriously, so the writer could face legal trouble for that.\n\nIn terms of the trespassing, if the neighbor's dog is entering the writer's yard without being controlled, the neighbor is at fault for not keeping their pet contained. The writer's right to protect their property is valid, but the way they communicated the threat could be an issue. Confronting the neighbor in a calm manner and discussing solutions might be more appropriate than aggressive language.\n\nSo, the writer's actions in physically intervening to protect their dog are understandable, but the method (kicking) and the threats (kill the dog, do something about trespassing) could be considered overreacting. The neighbor is definitely in the wrong for not taking responsibility, but the writer's response might lead to their own culpability. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats and the way they handled it, but I need to check if self-defense for the pet justifies it. However, threatening to kill is not a legal defense in most cases. So the correct choice is probably A.\n"
