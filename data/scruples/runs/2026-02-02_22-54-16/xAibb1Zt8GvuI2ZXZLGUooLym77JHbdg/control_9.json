They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own.\n\nThe context is that the writer has a small dog, and the neighbor's larger dog jumped the wall twice, attacking. The first time, they managed to pull the dog off. The second time, the dog got the writer's dog by the neck, and the writer kicked the neighbor's dog. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The writer then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are self-defense of their pet and the neighbor's responsibility. In many places, laws allow for protecting your pets from immediate danger. If a dog is attacking another dog, taking action to stop it, even if it causes injury, might be justified. However, threatening to kill someone's pet could be problematic. While the neighbor's dog is a menace, the writer's threat of violence might cross a legal or ethical line. \n\nBut there's also the neighbor's apathy. The neighbor didn't take measures to control their dog, which is their responsibility. The writer escalating to a threat after the dog attacked twice might be seen as self-defense, but the specific action of kicking the dog and then threatening to kill it could be where things get tricky. \n\nIn terms of the writer's actions, the kicking might be justified in the moment to stop an attack. However, the subsequent threats might be seen as over the top. Depending on local laws, threatening to kill someone else's pet could be a criminal threat or harassment. The neighbor's failure to secure their dog is also a factor, but the writer's response includes threats that go beyond immediate self-defense.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? On one hand, protecting their dog is understandable. On the other, the threats could be seen as excessive. The answer might hinge on whether the threats are considered within the bounds of self-defense or if they cross into threatening behavior. Given that the writer is threatening to kill the dog, which is someone else's property, that could be where they go wrong, even if the initial action was defensive. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem, but the writer's response might still be in the wrong because of the threats.\n"
