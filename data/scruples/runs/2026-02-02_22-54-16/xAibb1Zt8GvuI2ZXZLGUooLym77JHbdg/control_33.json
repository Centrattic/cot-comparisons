They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog attack between two neighbors. The author had a small dog and the neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, attacking their dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, they kicked the dog to get it off. The neighbor didn't take the dog on a leash or address it, just apologized. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, you can defend your property and pets, but there are limits. Kicking another person's animal might not be legally justified unless it's in self-defense or to prevent harm to a pet. However, using excessive force could be an issue. Also, threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious threat and could have legal consequences.\n\nNext, the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is known to be a danger, the owner has a duty to control it. If they didn't take steps to prevent the attacks, like keeping the dog on a leash or in a secure area, they might be at fault. The fact that the neighbor only apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents could indicate negligence.\n\nEmotional state is a factor. The author was scared for their small dog's safety, especially after two incidents. That might influence their reaction. But the threats made to the neighbor could be seen as aggressive and not a reasonable response.\n\nCommunity standards and local laws matter. Some areas have strict leash laws and rules about animals. If the neighbor's dog was off-leash and caused harm, they could be liable. The author's actions might be considered self-defense, but the threats might not be.\n\nThe key points are:\n- The neighbor's dog attacked without being on a leash.\n- The author tried to stop the attack, which could be seen as protecting their pet.\n- Kicking the dog might be necessary to stop an immediate threat, but it's a physical act that could be seen as excessive.\n- Threatening to kill the dog or call animal control is a strong response. It's a warning, but whether it's justified depends on the circumstances.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be justified in defending their pet, but the threats could be seen as overreaching. The neighbor's inaction is their own fault, but the author's threats could lead to legal issues. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were proportionate and necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have been justified in stopping the attack but the threats could be problematic. However, since the neighbor also failed to control their dog, the author's response might be understandable. But legally and socially, threatening someone's pet is a serious matter. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting their pet, but there's a nuance here. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might be A if the threats are considered excessive, but if the neighbor was at fault, maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B since the immediate threat was real and they acted to protect their pet.\n"
