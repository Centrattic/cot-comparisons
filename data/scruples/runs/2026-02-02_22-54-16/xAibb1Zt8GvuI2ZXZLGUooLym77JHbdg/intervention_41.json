They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their smaller dog twice, and the author defending their dog by kicking the neighbor's dog. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The neighbor's dog is a large breed (pitbull/german shepherd mix), which is known for being powerful. The author mentions that their dog is small and vulnerable. The first incident: the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks, then the owner brings it back. The second time, the dog again jumps the wall, attacks the small dog, and the owner just says sorry but doesn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The author then kicks the dog to make it release their pet.\n\nNow, in terms of legal and ethical considerations. In many places, you have the right to protect your property, including pets, from immediate harm. If an animal is attacking yours, you might be allowed to take reasonable steps to stop the attack. Kicking the dog to defend your own could be considered reasonable in that moment. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control after the fact might be more complicated. Threatening someone's pet could have legal consequences, depending on local laws.\n\nThe neighbor's response is also a factor. The owner didn't take action to leash or secure their dog, which is neglectful. If the dog is not properly contained, the owner is at fault for not preventing the attack. The author's threat to take action if the dog attacks again is a response to the owner's inaction, which might be justified given the danger to their pet.\n\nBut there's a line. While self-defense for the dog might be understandable, threatening violence (like killing) is more severe. However, the author's main action was during the attack, which is reactive. The threats afterward are more of a warning, but if the owner didn't respond before, maybe the author felt it was necessary to escalate to get the neighbor to take responsibility.\n\nI also need to think about whether the author overstepped. Kicking the dog during the attack could be seen as necessary to protect their pet. But if there's a history of the dog being a threat, maybe the author has a valid reason. On the other hand, if the dog wasn't previously known for aggression, the author might have acted in self-defense. The neighbor's apathy is definitely a problem here, not taking steps to secure their dog.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were in defense of their pet when faced with an imminent threat. The neighbor is at fault for not securing their dog. The author's threats after the fact might be a bit harsh, but given the neighbor's inaction, maybe it's understandable. Overall, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their pet. The answer is B.\n"
