They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their neighbor's dog attacking their own dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and chased the author's dog. The author pulled it off and shut the door. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time getting the author's dog by the neck. The author kicked the dog twice and threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take any action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a small dog that's vulnerable. The neighbor's dog is a big mix that could potentially be dangerous. The first attack was a surprise, and the author had to act quickly to protect their pet. The second attack happened the next day, and the neighbor didn't seem to take it seriously, just apologizing without addressing the dog's behavior. The author's reaction was to kick the dog to get it off and then make a threat about future actions.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, I know that in many places, you can act to protect your property (which includes pets) from immediate harm. So if the neighbor's dog is attacking, the author has a right to intervene. However, using force like kicking could be seen differently. If the dog was in the act of attacking, then self-defense or defense of property might justify kicking it. But if the force was excessive beyond what's necessary, that could be an issue.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is another point. If the owner isn't controlling their dog, especially a large one, they might be at fault for not keeping it on a leash or properly trained. The author's threat to call animal control or kill the dog is a strong response, but considering the neighbor's previous apathy, maybe the author felt they had no other choice. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog might be crossing a line, even if the dog is dangerous. There might be legal consequences for harming someone else's property, even if it's in defense.\n\nEmotionally, the author is shaken, and their reaction is understandable given the repeated attacks. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The key points are: protecting their dog from immediate danger (which is reasonable), using force that might be excessive (kicking twice hard enough to make the dog let go), and making threats that could be seen as violent or overzealous.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't just harm another person's animal unless it's in the act of causing harm. So if the dog was attacking, the author had a right to defend their pet. However, the kicking might be more than necessary if the dog could have been repelled with less force. Also, the threat to kill or harm the dog in the future could be problematic if it's not done through proper channels like animal control.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is also a factor. They should have controlled their dog, especially after the first incident. Their lack of action could mean they're the ones at fault, but the author's response might still be considered reasonable given the circumstances. However, the author's threats might escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for protecting their dog, but their method of using force and making threats could be seen as overreaching. It's a tough call, but the main issue is whether the author's actions were proportionate and legally justified. Since the dog was attacking, the initial force to stop the attack is probably okay. The threats, however, might be unwise and could lead to legal issues, but not necessarily make the author an asshole. The neighbor's inaction is definitely a problem, but the author's response is somewhat understandable given the risk to their own pet.\n"
