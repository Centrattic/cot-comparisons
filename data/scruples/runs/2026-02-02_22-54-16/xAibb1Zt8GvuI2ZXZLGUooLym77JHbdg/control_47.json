They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting their neighbor's dog after two incidents. Let me read through the context again to make sure I get the details right.\n\nThe person lives next to a new family with a big dog, a pitbull/german shepard mix. The writer has a small dog and was worried because the neighbor's dog could hurt theirs. The first time, the dog jumped the wall and attacked, the writer tried to pull it off. The neighbor came over and took the dog back. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time getting the writer's dog's neck. The writer kicked the dog to make it let go, then threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. Now the writer is unsure if they overreacted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the neighbor's dog is a large breed that's known to be used for guarding. The writer has a small dog that's vulnerable. The first attack: the writer intervened to protect their dog. The neighbor didn't seem to take it seriously. Then the second attack, the writer kicks the dog. The neighbor apologizes but doesn't take action. The writer threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again, and to act if the neighbor's dog trespasses.\n\nNow, considering the laws and societal norms: In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or pets. The writer's dog is at risk of serious harm. Kicking the dog might be seen as a necessary action to prevent injury to their own pet. However, the act of kicking a dog, even in the heat of the moment, could be seen as animal cruelty if done with malice. But the context is self-defense of their own animal.\n\nThe neighbor's negligence is also a factor. If the dog has a history of aggression and the owner isn't taking steps to control it (leashing, training, etc.), they could be at fault for not preventing the incidents. The writer's threats (calling animal control or killing the dog) might be strong, but given the circumstances, it's understandable that they'd be protective. However, threatening to kill another person's animal could be legally problematic, depending on local laws. But if the dog is a repeated danger, some jurisdictions might support such actions as protecting one's pets.\n\nThe key points here are: the writer acted to protect their own dog, the neighbor's dog is out of control, the neighbor isn't addressing the problem, and the writer's response was in the immediate moment to stop an attack. The writer's threats might be seen as justified if the neighbor is negligent, but using physical force on another's dog could be a gray area. However, in many places, you can use necessary force to protect your own animals from an immediate threat.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect their pet from an aggressive dog. The neighbor's inaction is a problem, but the writer's actions were in response to imminent danger. The answer might be B (the writer is not in the wrong), but I need to check if any laws or typical Reddit opinions on similar situations lean one way. On Reddit, similar stories often result in the person defending their pet being seen as justified, especially if they didn't harm the other dog beyond what's necessary. Kicking might be a bit harsh, but given the situation, it might be excused as a reaction. The threats could be seen as over the line, but the overall situation is about protecting a vulnerable pet from a dangerous dog.\n"
