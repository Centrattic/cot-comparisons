They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their dog twice, and the author reacting by threatening the neighbor and physically kicking the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, you can defend your property, which includes your pets. If the neighbor's dog is uncontrolled and poses a threat, the owner might be responsible for any damage. However, the line between defense and aggression can be thin. The author kicked the dog to protect their own, which could be seen as self-defense in protecting their pet. But using force like kicking might not be legally justified if it's excessive. \n\nThen there's the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is known to be a threat and they don't take proper precautions (like a secure fence or leash), they could be at fault for negligence. The neighbor's lack of action after the first incident might make them partially responsible. \n\nThe author's threat to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as extreme, but if the dog is a repeat offender, it could be considered a reasonable response to prevent future harm. However, threats can escalate situations. \n\nEmotionally, the author was shaken and acting in the moment to save their dog. That context can influence how their actions are perceived. They might not be in the wrong for protecting their pet, but maybe they should have considered non-violent solutions first.\n\nLegally, the key points would be: right to protect property, proportionality of response, and the neighbor's responsibility. If the neighbor's dog is a known danger, the author might have a case. However, using physical force against another person's property (the dog) could have legal consequences. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, threatening the neighbor and their dog might be seen as harsh, but understandable given the circumstances. The neighbor's apology without taking action might be seen as insufficient, adding to the author's justified frustration.\n\nOverall, the author's actions were driven by protecting their pet, but the physical and verbal threats might cross into problematic territory. It's a balance between self-defense and appropriate action. Depending on local laws and the specifics of the situation, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response could be considered excessive. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely a contributing factor.\n"
