They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's go through the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're the asshole for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard and attacked their smaller dog. The context is that they have a small dog, and their new neighbors got a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked their dog. The first time, the user pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the user's dog by the neck, so the user kicked it to get it off. Then they threatened to kill the dog or call animal control if it happened again. The neighbor just apologized but didn't take action to prevent it. Now the user is wondering if they overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here: protecting one's own pet from an imminent threat, the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog, and the user's response. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about pets attacking others. If a dog is uncontrolled and attacks someone or another animal, the owner can be held responsible. However, the user's actions of kicking the dog could be seen as self-defense on behalf of their pet. If the dog was in the process of attacking and the user intervened to stop the attack, that might be justified. But the threats to kill the dog or call animal control might be on the line. \n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a problem. If their dog has a history of aggression and they don't control it, that's their fault. The user's response might be a reaction to the neighbor's negligence. However, threatening to kill the dog could be seen as excessive, even if motivated by fear. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? On one hand, they were protecting their pet. On the other, using physical force and making threats. It depends on local laws and how the situation is perceived. If the user's actions were necessary to prevent harm to their dog, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But the threats might be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are better ways to handle it, like immediately involving authorities or getting the neighbor to properly restrain their dog. The user's reaction could be seen as justified in the moment, but the threats might be over the line. \n\nI think the user isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their pet from a life-threatening situation. However, their response could have been more measured. So the answer might be B, but I'm not 100% sure. But according to the options given (A for yes, B for no), the user is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
