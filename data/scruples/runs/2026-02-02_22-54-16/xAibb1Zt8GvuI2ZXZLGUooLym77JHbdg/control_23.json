They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two neighbors with dogs. The author's smaller dog was attacked twice by the neighbor's larger dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the second time, they kicked it to get it off. They also threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, people have the right to protect their property and pets. If someone's pet is in immediate danger, using reasonable force to protect it might be justified. However, the line between defense and excessive force can be thin. Kicking a dog could be seen as excessive, depending on the circumstances. Also, threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious matter and could have legal consequences.\n\nThe neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, which indicates that the owner might not have controlled the dog adequately. The neighbor's apathy in the first incident is concerning because they didn't take steps to prevent the second attack. But the author's response of threatening to kill the dog might escalate tensions and could be seen as aggressive.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the author might be within their rights to protect their own dog, but using force like kicking could be considered animal cruelty if it causes harm to the neighbor's dog. Also, making threats to kill someone's pet is not advisable and could lead to legal issues even if the dog attacked first.\n\nEthically, while the author's concern for their own dog is understandable, the response might be seen as disproportionate. Threatening to kill the dog without allowing the neighbor a chance to address the issue properly could be considered overreacting. The author should consider reporting the incident to authorities or using a mediator rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe neighbor might be at fault for not controlling their dog and not taking steps to prevent such incidents, but the author's response could also be problematic. The key points are the methods used to protect the dog and the nature of the threats made. If the author's actions were necessary to prevent harm, that's one side, but if they used excessive force or made illegal threats, that's another.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements where the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the author's use of force and threats might place them in the wrong as well. However, given the context of protecting a pet from immediate danger, the author might be in a more justified position. But the specific response of kicking and threats could be problematic. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being entirely at fault, but with some responsibility for the approach taken.\n"

  "answer": "B",
  "full_response": "The author's actions to protect their dog from imminent harm are understandable, but their response involved physical force (kicking the dog) and threats (calling animal control or killing it), which could cross legal and ethical boundaries. While the neighbor bears responsibility for the uncontrolled dog, the author's use of excessive force and hostile threats may be seen as disproportionate and escalatory. However, given the immediate threat to their pet, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The situation is nuanced, but the threats and physical retaliation could be problematic. \n\n**B**",
