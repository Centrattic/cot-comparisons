They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The author's dog was attacked by the neighbor's dog, which is a pitbull/german shepard mix. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and chased the author's dog. The author tried to intervene but the neighbor just took their dog back. Then the next day, the same thing happened, and the neighbor's dog had the author's dog by the neck. The author kicked the dog twice to get it off, and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are self-defense, property rights, and how to handle an aggressive animal. The author's primary concern is protecting their own dog, which is reasonable. The neighbor's dog is large and potentially dangerous, and the neighbor didn't seem to take the threat seriously, just apologizing without taking action like leashing the dog. \n\nThe author's actions in kicking the dog were to prevent harm to their own pet. Physical intervention to stop an attack can be justified, especially when the animal is on their property. However, the author also made threats to kill the dog or call animal control, which might be considered excessive. But given the urgency of protecting their own dog, it's understandable. The neighbor's inaction and the dog's repeated aggressive behavior probably contributed to the author's actions.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can take reasonable actions to protect your property and animals. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be considered reasonable. The threats, though, could be problematic, but the context is understandable due to the fear and anger from the situation. The neighbor's failure to control their dog is a significant factor here. So overall, the author's actions were likely in self-defense to protect their pet, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
