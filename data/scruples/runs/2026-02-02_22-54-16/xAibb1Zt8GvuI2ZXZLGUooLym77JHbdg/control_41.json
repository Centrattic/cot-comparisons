They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about two neighbors with dogs. The writer has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a big pitbull/german shepherd mix. The big dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the small dog. The first time, the writer pulls the dog off. The second time, when the big dog gets the small one by the neck, the writer kicks it to save their dog. Then the neighbor just says sorry but doesn't take action. The writer threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: self-defense of their pet, the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog, and the writer's response. The writer's actions were to protect their own dog from immediate harm. Kicking the dog to stop an attack could be seen as necessary in the moment. The neighbor's apathy is a problem because they didn't take steps to prevent the dog from causing harm again. The writer's threats might be strong, but given the situation, they might be justified in feeling that they have no other recourse if the neighbor isn't acting. The question is whether the writer is the asshole. \n\nIn many places, laws allow for reasonable actions to protect property and pets. The writer's actions to prevent their dog from being attacked could be considered reasonable. The neighbor's failure to control their dog is on them. The threats might be harsh, but given the neighbor's inaction, the writer might feel it's necessary to take a stand. So, the answer is probably B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
