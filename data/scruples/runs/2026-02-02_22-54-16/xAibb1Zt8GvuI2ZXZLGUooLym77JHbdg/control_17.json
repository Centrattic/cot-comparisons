They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The context is that the author has a small dog, and the neighbor's larger dog twice jumped the wall to attack. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the next day, they kicked the dog to make it let go. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the neighbor's dog is a large breed that could potentially harm the smaller dog. The dog jumped the wall twice, each time attacking the author's dog. The first time, the author physically intervened to stop the attack. The second time, they kicked the dog harder when it wouldn't let go. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the immediate action of kicking the dog. In terms of self-defense for pets, people often take measures to protect their animals. However, using force that causes harm to another person's dog could be legally questionable. The author's actions might be considered excessive. For example, kicking a dog that's attacking their pet could be seen as necessary to protect their own property and animal, but if it results in injury to the neighbor's dog, there might be legal repercussions. \n\nThen there's the threat of killing the dog or calling animal control. Threats can be legally problematic, depending on the jurisdiction. If the author made a threat that could be perceived as harassment or as a criminal threat, that could be an issue. However, the neighbor's inaction might be a factor here. If the neighbor isn't taking steps to secure their dog, the author might feel justified in taking stronger measures, but the methods and threats could still be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor allowed their dog to jump the fence and attack another dog twice. If they didn't take action after the first incident, they're neglecting their duty as a pet owner. The author might feel justified in protecting their dog, but the force used and the threats could cross a line.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals. Kicking the dog when it was attacking might be considered reasonable, but the follow-up threats might not be. However, if the neighbor's dog is a known danger and they haven't taken steps to prevent it, the author might have a case for self-defense.\n\nEmotionally, the author was shaken and acting in the moment. That can sometimes lead to overreactions, but the neighbor's inaction could be a contributing factor. The author's main goal was to protect their own pet, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of community standards, people might have different opinions. Some would say the author was within their rights to protect their dog, while others might see the kicking and threats as excessive. The neighbor's failure to act also plays a role in whether the author's response is justified.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as a reasonable response to protect their pet, especially given the neighbor's lack of action. However, the threats and the method of using force could be points where the author is in the wrong. But since the neighbor is also at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate and necessary. Kicking the dog to stop an attack could be seen as necessary, but the threats might not be. However, the neighbor's inaction is a significant part of the problem here. It's possible that the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their pet, but their approach might have been too aggressive, especially with the threats. But given the context, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
