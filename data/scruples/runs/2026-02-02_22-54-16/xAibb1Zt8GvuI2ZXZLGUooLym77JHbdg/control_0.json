They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their neighbor's dog jumping over the wall and attacking their smaller dog. The author kicked the dog to get it off their own pet. They also threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around self-defense for pets. In many places, you can take reasonable action to protect your animals from immediate danger. If the neighbor's dog was attacking, kicking it to stop the attack might be seen as necessary. But there's a line between defending your pet and being overly aggressive. The key here is whether the author's response was proportional to the threat.\n\nThe neighbor didn't do anything to prevent the dog from attacking again, which is a problem. If the dog is a known danger, the owner is responsible. The author might feel they had to take matters into their own hands because the owner wasn't doing their job. But threatening to kill the dog or using force might be crossing a line legally or socially.\n\nAlso, the author's threats to the neighbor could be an issue. Making threats, even in the heat of the moment, might not be the best approach. However, the neighbor's inaction is part of the problem. The author might feel justified in protecting their pet, especially if previous attempts to communicate with the neighbor failed.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, using force to defend your pet is usually allowed if it's immediate and necessary. However, threatening to kill someone's dog could lead to legal trouble unless you have a restraining order or legal justification. The author might have overstepped by making such a threat, even if done out of fear and frustration.\n\nIn terms of community norms, threatening to kill someone's pet is rarely acceptable. It's possible the author is within their rights to defend their dog but the way they communicated their response could be problematic. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor here, but the author's actions might not be entirely their fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of defending their pet, but the threats could be an issue. It's a bit of a grey area. However, since they were protecting their pet from an immediate threat, their actions might be considered reasonable. The neighbor's lack of action is definitely part of the problem too. But the final answer depends on whether the author's actions were proportionate and if they followed proper procedures, like contacting authorities first.\n"
