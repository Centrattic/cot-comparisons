They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped over the fence and attacked their own dog. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor got a large pitbull/german shepard mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the fence twice, attacking the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled it off. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so they kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nIn terms of self-defense for pets: In many jurisdictions, you have the right to protect your property and animals. If the neighbor's dog is uncontrolled and attacking, it's reasonable to take action to stop it. The author's actions to kick the dog to save their own might be justified. However, using excessive force could be an issue. Kicking it hard enough to make it let go might be necessary in the moment, but if it caused serious harm, that's a different story. The neighbor's dog was trespassing and attacking, so the author might have a valid reason to act.\n\nThe threats mentioned: The author threatened to kill the dog if it happened again. That's a strong statement. Depending on local laws, making threats about killing someone's property (even animals) might have legal implications. However, if the dog is a danger to their small dog, the author might feel justified. Still, threatening to kill could be seen as over the line, even if their intent was to protect their pet.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility: The neighbor got a large dog without considering the neighborhood, and it's clear the dog isn't properly controlled. They didn't take steps after the first incident, which is negligent. The neighbor's apathy is definitely an issue. But the author's response in threatening and using force might be seen as necessary given the circumstances.\n\nLegal perspective: In some places, you can use reasonable force to protect your animals. If the author's actions were reasonable to stop the attack, they might be within their rights. However, threatening to kill someone's dog could be problematic. The author might be advised to contact animal control or take legal steps rather than making threats.\n\nEmotional state: The author was clearly shaken and acted out of fear for their small dog's safety. That can be a mitigating factor in understanding their actions, but it doesn't necessarily excuse them if the force was excessive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions to protect their dog were likely justified, especially since the neighbor's dog was uncontrolled. However, the threats made after the incident could be seen as over the top, even if motivated by fear. They might not be in the wrong for the initial actions but the threats could land them in trouble. The neighbor is definitely at fault for not controlling their dog, but the author's response has elements that could be questioned.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. If the force used was reasonable to stop an immediate threat, then no. However, the threats might be a problem. But since the user is asking for a yes or no based on whether the author is in the wrong, I have to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that the main action was to protect their dog and the threats were a response to negligence, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
