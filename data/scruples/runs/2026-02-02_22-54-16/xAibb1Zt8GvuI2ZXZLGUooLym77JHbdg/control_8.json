They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to kill their neighbor's dog after two incidents where the dog attacked their own dog. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The neighbor's dog is a pitbull/german shepard mix, which is big and maybe aggressive. The author has a small dog that could be in danger. The first time, the dog jumped the wall and attacked, then the neighbor just took it back without doing anything. The second time, the dog again attacked, and the author kicked it to save their dog. Then they threatened the neighbor with calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. In many places, you have a right to protect your property and pets. If the dog is a threat, using reasonable force to protect your own animal might be justified. However, threatening to kill someone's pet could be problematic. But if the neighbor wasn't taking any action to control their dog, maybe the author felt they had no choice.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's reaction was just an apology without taking any steps to prevent future attacks. So the author might feel they had to take matters into their own hands. However, the threat to kill could be seen as excessive, even if the dog is dangerous. Maybe the author should have tried contacting the neighbor more formally, or animal control, instead of making threats.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on local laws, but generally, using force to defend your pet can be acceptable, especially if the other dog is a known threat. However, the threat to kill might cross a line unless there's imminent danger. So maybe the answer is that the author is not the asshole because they were protecting their pet, but the neighbor is for not controlling their dog. However, the author's response might be a bit extreme. But given the context, it's a tough call.\n\nLooking at similar cases, people often justify self-defense with pets. The author did try to stop the attack, so their actions in defense might be acceptable. The neighbor's apathy is definitely a problem. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
