They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong after their dog got attacked by a neighbor's dog. The main points are that the neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked their smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off. The second time, they kicked the neighbor's dog twice when it had their dog by the neck. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, self-defense for pets. People often protect their animals, so the author's actions might be seen as defending their dog. However, using physical force by kicking the neighbor's dog might be an issue. Kicking could be considered excessive, especially if it caused harm. But the dog was attacking their pet, so maybe it's justified as a defensive action. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThen there's the threat to kill the dog or call animal control. Threats can be legally problematic, depending on the jurisdiction. But in terms of moral culpability, if the neighbor isn't doing anything, the author might feel justified in escalating. However, the threat could be seen as aggressive and not the best way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a point. They said sorry but didn't take steps to prevent future incidents. That might shift some blame to the neighbor for not controlling their dog. The author's ultimatum could be justified given the neighbor's lack of action.\n\nBut the physical act of kicking the dog. Legally, if the dog was trespassing and attacking, the homeowner might have the right to defend their property and pets. However, the force used might be excessive. Kicking could lead to injury, which might not be necessary if the author had other options, like using a barrier or calling authorities immediately.\n\nThe author did try to stop the dog the first time and then escalated after the second incident. The neighbor's failure to address the problem is definitely a factor. So maybe the author's actions are understandable given the circumstances, but the threat might be crossing a line, even if the neighbor was apathetic.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the author's actions were in defense of their pet, and the neighbor's neglect is a problem. The kicking might be justified in the heat of the moment, but the threats are more questionable. However, the neighbor's inaction makes the author's response more understandable. It's possible the author isn't the asshole here, but there are elements of overreaction in the form of the threats. But maybe in the context of the neighbor's failure, it's justified. So overall, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's some nuance.\n"
