They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors and their dogs. The author has a small dog and the new neighbor has a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the author's dog. The author kicked the dog to protect their own pet. Now they're feeling guilty and wondering if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was trying to protect their small dog from a larger, potentially aggressive dog. The neighbor didn't seem to take the issue seriously, even after two incidents. The author felt threatened and acted to defend their pet. \n\nIn many places, laws regarding animal attacks can vary, but generally, if an animal is attacking another animal, the owner might be responsible. The author's actions were in defense of their own pet. However, using physical force like kicking could be seen as excessive. But considering the immediate danger, some might argue it was necessary. \n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a factor. If the owner isn't controlling their dog properly, that's a problem. The author's threats after the second incident might be seen as justified given the lack of response from the neighbor. However, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic legally, but maybe in the heat of the moment, it's understandable.\n\nI should check if there are specific laws about defending against animal attacks. In some jurisdictions, you might be allowed to take reasonable steps to protect your property (including pets) from an immediate threat. Kicking to stop an attack might be within that range. But threatening to kill could have legal consequences, depending on local laws. However, the story is from the author's perspective, and they might not know the exact legal terms. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's dog repeatedly trespassed, which is another issue. The author's warning to the neighbor about trespassing is valid. But the main issue is the dog attacks. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were in response to a direct threat to their pet. The neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The author might have used reasonable force in the moment. The threats after could be seen as excessive, but given the circumstances, maybe not. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. Kicking to stop an attack might be seen as necessary. However, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the neighbor's dog was the aggressor and the author acted to protect their pet, the author is likely not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
