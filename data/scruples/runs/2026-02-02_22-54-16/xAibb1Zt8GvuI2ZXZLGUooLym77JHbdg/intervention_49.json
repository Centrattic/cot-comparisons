They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for defending their dog. The situation involves two dogs, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix jumping over a wall and attacking a smaller dog. The author kicked the dog to protect their own pet and threatened to kill it again if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog has already attacked twice, and the owners didn't take action. The author felt their dog was in danger of being killed. In self-defense situations, people often act to protect their property or pets. But in some places, the law might consider using force against another person's property, even an animal, as illegal. However, if the dog was trespassing and attacking, the laws might vary by location. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can't just harm or kill someone else's animal without justification. For example, some states allow defending your pet if there's an immediate threat. But threatening to kill might be problematic. The author did mention they told the neighbor they'd call animal control, which is a legal step. However, threatening to kill might be seen as a serious threat, which could have legal consequences. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's apathy is a factor. If the owners didn't take steps to control their dog, they might be at fault for not keeping it contained. But the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014could be seen as excessive. Depending on the region, reasonable force to prevent harm to one's pet might be allowed, but the author's response might be considered aggressive. \n\nThe key points are: the dog's behavior was uncontrolled, the owners didn't act, the author's actions were in defense of their pet. However, using physical force and threats might cross a line. So, the answer isn't straightforward. But given that the author acted to protect their own pet from an immediate threat and the neighbor was negligent, the author might not be in the wrong. However, their method of response (kicking and threats) could be questioned. It's a bit of a gray area. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the immediate danger to their dog, the answer might lean towards B (No). But if the law sees it as excessive, maybe A. However, in many cases, defending against an attack is justified.\n"
