They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog from the neighbor jumping into their yard and attacking their smaller dog. The writer kicked the dog when it was attacking their pet and then threatened the neighbor to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if your dog is in immediate danger, you might have the right to defend it. However, kicking the dog might be an issue. Depending on laws, using force to protect your property or animals is allowed, but excessive force could be a problem. The writer tried to pull the dog off first, then kicked when that didn't work. The second time, the dog was biting their dog's neck, so the situation was more urgent. But kicking might still be considered excessive. \n\nThen there's the threat to kill the dog if needed. Threats of violence might be legally problematic, even if made in a moment of anger. It could be seen as menacing or threatening another person. \n\nThe neighbor's response is also a factor. If the neighbor was apathetic and didn't take steps to control their dog, they might be at fault for not securing their pet. However, the writer's response could be seen as aggressive. Threatening to kill the dog might not be justified, even if the neighbor wasn't proactive enough. \n\nEmotional state matters too. The writer was clearly shaken and acting in defense of their pet. But does that justify their actions? It's a balance between self-defense and overreaction. \n\nIn terms of community norms, using physical force against another person's animal and making threats might not be acceptable, even if the motivation is protecting their pet. There might be proper channels to address this, like contacting the neighbor, then animal control, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, the writer might have a valid concern about their dog's safety, but their actions\u2014especially the kicking and threats\u2014could be seen as over the line. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem, but the writer's reaction might be the immediate issue here. \n\nI think the answer could be nuanced, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), because of the physical violence and threats, even if the situation was urgent. However, if the dog was in the act of attacking, maybe the response is justified. But kicking a dog that's on someone's property might not be the best approach. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a strong statement, which could be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author was protecting their pet and had no other option, hence B (No). But depending on the laws and the context, it's a toss-up. Given that the neighbor is responsible for their dog, not acting appropriately, but the author's actions might be seen as self-defense. However, the way they responded could still be considered excessive. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can't just harm or threaten to kill an animal unless it's in the act of attacking you or your property, but the specifics matter. If the dog was trespassing and attacking, maybe the author is within their rights. But kicking might still be an issue. The threats of violence could be problematic, regardless of the situation. \n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards A (Yes), the author is in the wrong due to the use of violence and threats, even if the situation was stressful. Proper steps would be to try to prevent the dog from escaping again, perhaps using barriers, and contacting authorities or the neighbor more effectively. The immediate reaction might not be the best approach legally or socially.\n"
