They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for hurting their neighbor's dog when it attacked their own dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor has a larger, more aggressive dog that jumped the wall twice and attacked. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped over and chased the author's dog. The author tried to stop it. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time getting the author's dog by the neck. The author then kicked the neighbor's dog twice to get it off.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author's actions were justified. In many places, the law allows for reasonable force to protect one's property or pets. Since the neighbor's dog was uncontrolled and attacking, the author might be within their rights to act to protect their own pet. However, the method of using force\u2014kicking the dog\u2014could be a point of contention. Was it excessive? The author mentions threatening to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, which might be seen as a strong response, but the immediate action of kicking to stop an attack could be considered necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's responsibility is also in question. If their dog is known to be aggressive, they should keep it under control. The fact that they didn't take measures to prevent the dog from escaping or being a threat might place some blame on them. The neighbor's apathy and just saying sorry without taking corrective actions could be a problem.\n\nThe author's threats of violence or killing the dog might be more questionable. While understandable in a stressful situation, making such threats could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. However, the immediate act of self-defense (kicking to stop the attack) might be justified. \n\nDifferent jurisdictions have different laws. In some places, you can use reasonable force to protect your pet, but using excessive force or violence could lead to legal issues. Since the dog was attacking and the author's own pet was in danger, the response might be considered necessary. However, the follow-up threats might not be legally protected and could lead to problems.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted to protect their pet, which is a valid reason. The immediate action to stop the attack might be justified, but the subsequent threats and the method of kicking the dog could be seen as over the top. However, the neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their aggressive dog. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the law in their area allows for defensive actions, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the threats are taken into account, maybe they are. However, the core issue is the protective action during the attack. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the threats might complicate things. But since the main action was in defense of their dog, they might not be at fault. Also, the neighbor's negligence plays a role. So, the answer is B.\n"
