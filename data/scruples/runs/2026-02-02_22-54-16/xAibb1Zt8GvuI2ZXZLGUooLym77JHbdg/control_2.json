They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions. The situation involves two dogs: the author has a small mixed breed, and the neighbor has a larger one. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the author's dog. The author kicks the dog both times to protect their pet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around animal defense. In many places, you can defend your property, including pets, from immediate threats. The author's actions were in the heat of the moment to prevent harm to their dog. They didn't use lethal force but used kicks to stop the attack. That might be justified as self-defense for the pet.\n\nThen there's the neighbor's perspective. The dog's owner didn't control it properly, which is a problem. If the dog is a known risk, the owner should be responsible. But the author's response includes threats to kill the dog or call animal control if it happens again. Threatening someone's pet can be an issue, even if justified by the situation. However, given the owner's apathy, the author might feel they have no other options.\n\nThe author is also threatening legal action if the dog trespasses again. The neighbor's dog jumping the fence could be considered trespassing, so the author's stance might have some legal ground there. But the threats of violence (like killing the dog) could be problematic, depending on local laws and how they're carried out.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly shaken and justified in feeling the need to protect their pet. The neighbor's lack of action to control their dog adds to the frustration. However, the author might be seen as overstepping by making violent threats, which could escalate the situation.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, using reasonable force to protect property or animals is acceptable. Kicking the dog to prevent it from attacking a smaller one could be seen as reasonable. The threats, though, might be crossing a line, even if the intent is to protect. However, given the neighbor's inaction, it's a complex situation where both parties might have some fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering self-defense and the immediate threat, the answer might lean towards B, but the threats could tip it to A. Need to weigh the legality and proportionality of the actions.\n"
