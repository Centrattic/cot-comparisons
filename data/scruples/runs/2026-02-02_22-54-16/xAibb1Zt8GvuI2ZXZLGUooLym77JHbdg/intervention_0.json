They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that attacked their own dog. The situation involves two dogs: the neighbor's large mix (Beef Boy) and the author's small dog. The author describes two incidents where the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and attacked their dog. In the second incident, the author kicked the dog to stop it from attacking. Now, the author is questioning if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and common practices regarding protecting pets. In many places, there are laws that allow for the defense of one's property or animals when necessary. However, the method used to protect the pet is important. Kicking a dog might be seen as excessive force depending on the circumstances. If the dog was actively attacking the author's pet, using force to stop the attack could be justified, but the level of force matters. Kicking could potentially cause harm or even kill the dog, which might cross a line.\n\nNext, the neighbor's responsibility. The neighbor's dog was uncontrolled, jumping the wall and attacking. The neighbor's failure to leashed or properly contain the dog could be a point against them. However, the neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. That apathy might be part of the problem.\n\nThe author's threat to \"kill it\" or call animal control if the dog acted up again is a key point. Threats can escalate situations. While understandable given the fear for their pet's safety, making such threats could be seen as extreme, especially if the neighbor didn't take them seriously. However, the author's main action was in defending their dog, which is a strong consideration.\n\nI should also consider if there are any specific dog laws in the area mentioned. The author mentions they live in a safer area, which might imply that the neighbor's large dog is unexpected. But without knowing the local laws, it's hard to say. However, in many jurisdictions, the owner is responsible for their dog's actions, especially if it's a known aggressive dog.\n\nThe author's actions were reactive in the moment. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be seen as a reasonable defense to protect their own pet, especially if they felt immediate danger. However, the aftermath\u2014threatening to kill the dog or call animal control\u2014could be problematic. But given the context of trying to prevent future attacks, some might see this as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, using physical force on another person's property (the neighbor's dog) could be considered trespassing or causing damage to property, which might make the author legally liable. But if the dog was in the act of attacking their own pet, self-defense for the pet is a defense.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's actions during the attack might be defensible, but the threats afterward could be seen as overreaching. However, considering the neighbor's lack of action, the author might feel justified. The main question is whether the force used was excessive. Kicking a dog that's attacking your pet could be seen as a reasonable response if it's the only way to stop the attack immediately. But if there were other options (like using a stick or calling for help), that might be a different scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's immediate actions to protect their dog might be understandable and not in the wrong, especially given the neighbor's apathy. However, the threats could be seen as harsh, but the overall situation might be more the neighbor's fault for not controlling their dog. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
