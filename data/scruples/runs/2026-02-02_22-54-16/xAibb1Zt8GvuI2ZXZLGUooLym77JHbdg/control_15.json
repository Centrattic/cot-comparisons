They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hitting their neighbor's dog. First, the context: the neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to separate them. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked the dog to free their pet.\n\nSo, the key points here are self-defense of their own pet. In many places, laws allow for the protection of property and animals. The author's actions seem to be in defense of their dog. However, using force, especially kicking the dog, might be seen as aggressive. But considering the immediate threat to their small dog, which could have been seriously injured or killed, the response might be justified.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they didn't take steps to control their dog, maybe they're partially at fault. The author's threats to call animal control or kill the dog could be problematic if they went too far, but given the circumstances, their fear is understandable.\n\nLegally, defending one's property (which includes a pet) from an immediate threat might be considered reasonable. However, the use of force must be proportionate. Kicking the dog twice might be seen as necessary to stop the attack. The author's communication with the neighbor about future actions might be a bit aggressive, but it's a reaction to repeated incidents.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). Their actions were in defense of their pet, and the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog plays a role. The author's response seems reasonable given the threat.\n"
