They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two dogs, one from the neighbor's which is a bigger mix, and the author's smaller dog. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The author kicked the dog when it was attacking their pet and then threatened the neighbor if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you're allowed to protect your property, which includes pets. So if the neighbor's dog is attacking the author's dog, taking action to stop it might be justified. However, using physical force like kicking could be a problem. If the dog was in the neighbor's yard or on their property, the author might not have a right to harm it. But in this case, the dog jumped the wall into the author's yard, which is their property. So maybe the author has the right to defend their dog on their own property.\n\nBut then there's the method used. Kicking the dog might be considered excessive force or animal cruelty, especially if the dog wasn't a threat to the person. The neighbor's dog was attacking the author's dog, so the intent was to protect their own pet. However, if the author harmed the neighbor's dog, even in defense of their own, there could be legal consequences. The neighbor might claim that the author injured their pet without justification.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility is a factor. They have a dog that's prone to attacking others' pets. If they didn't take measures like keeping it leashed or secured, they might be at fault. The author's threats of calling animal control or killing the dog if it happens again could be seen as overreacting, but given the circumstances, it might be understandable.\n\nThe key points here are property rights, the right to protect one's property (pets), the proportionality of the force used, and the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog. If the author's actions were necessary to prevent harm to their own dog, they might not be in the wrong. However, the method of using force and threats could complicate things. It's a balance between self-defense (for the pet) and potential legal issues regarding the neighbor's property.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property. Kicking the dog might be considered reasonable in the heat of the moment to stop an attack. But if the author caused serious harm to the neighbor's dog, that could be a problem. Also, threatening to kill the dog might be seen as excessive, even if the neighbor was negligent.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's main concern was protecting their own dog. The neighbor's failure to control their dog is a significant point. The author's actions were in response to an immediate threat. However, the method of response (kicking) and the threats made could be seen as oversteps. But depending on the circumstances and local laws, the author might still be in the right to protect their pet. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the neighbor is at fault for their dog's actions and not taking responsibility.\n"
