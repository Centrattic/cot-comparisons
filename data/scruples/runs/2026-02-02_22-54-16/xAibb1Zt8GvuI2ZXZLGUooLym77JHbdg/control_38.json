They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's dog jumping into their yard and attacking their small dog. The author kicked the dog to protect theirs and threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The neighbor's dog is a large, aggressive mix that jumped the wall twice. The first time, the author tried to separate them. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so they kicked it to save theirs. The neighbor apologized but didn't take steps to prevent it from happening again.\n\nNow, the author's actions: using force to protect their pet. Kicking the dog to make it release their own dog. Threatening to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor is criticized for being apathetic.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or pets. Kicking the dog to prevent harm to their own dog might be considered reasonable. Threatening to kill the dog, however, could be seen as excessive or threatening. But if the dog is a known danger, there might be justification.\n\nEthically, the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The author's threat of killing the dog if it attacks again might be harsh, but given the circumstances, some might understand the frustration. The key points are the neighbor's failure to secure their dog and the immediate threat to a small pet. The author's actions were defensive. However, the threat to kill might be a point against them. But overall, the neighbor's negligence is more at fault.\n\nSo, the author is probably not in the wrong. They protected their pet from immediate danger. The neighbor is the asshole for not taking responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
