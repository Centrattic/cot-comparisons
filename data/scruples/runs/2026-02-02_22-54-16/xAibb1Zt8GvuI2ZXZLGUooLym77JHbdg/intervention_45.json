They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's large dog jumping into their backyard and attacking their small dog twice. The author kicked the dog when it was attacking their pet and threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a mix of a pitbull and German Shepherd, which is a big breed. The first time, the dog jumped the wall and chased the Chihuahua/Miniature Pinscher mix. The author tried to intervene but couldn't stop it. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time with its mouth around the small dog's neck. The author kicked it to get it to let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't seem to take action beyond that.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, you have a right to defend your property and pets. If a dog is attacking yours, it's reasonable to take action to protect them. Kicking another person's dog in defense could be justified if it's necessary to prevent harm. However, the severity of the action matters. Kicking the dog once or twice to stop the attack might be seen as reasonable, but if it caused unnecessary harm, that's different. Here, the author says they kicked it and then harder when it didn't let go, so it might be within self-defense.\n\nEthically, the neighbor's responsibility is also a factor. If the neighbor knew their dog was aggressive and didn't take steps to control it, they're at fault. The author's threats might be understandable given the stress of the situation. The neighbor's apathy in not addressing the issue could shift blame away from the author.\n\nHowever, the author's threats of \"kill it\" might be seen as extreme. While understandable in anger, such a statement could be problematic if they later act on it. But given the circumstances, it's a reaction to a clear threat to their pet. The neighbor's failure to secure their dog also plays a role here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted to protect their pet when the neighbor didn't control their dog. The actions taken were in response to an immediate threat. The neighbor's lack of action makes the author's response more justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
