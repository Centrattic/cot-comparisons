They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The context is that their neighbor got a big dog, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix, which attacked their small dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and chased their dog, and the neighbor just took the dog back without addressing the issue. The second time, the dog attacked again, and the person kicked the dog to make it let go. They also threatened the neighbor about future actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Self-defense for pets is a tricky area. In many places, you can protect your property or family, but using force on an animal might have legal consequences. Kicking the dog could be considered animal cruelty, even if it was to protect their own pet. Also, threatening to call animal control or kill the dog could be seen as aggression.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's dog was a danger to their small dog, and the neighbor seemed apathetic. The author acted to prevent harm to their pet. However, the method they used (kicking) and the threats might be problematic. The neighbor's responsibility is to control their dog, especially since it's a larger breed that could be dangerous. If the dog is not properly contained, the owner could be liable, but the author's response might still be seen as excessive.\n\nLegally, using force to protect property might be allowed, but intentionally harming another person's animal could be an issue. The author might have had the right to protect their dog, but the physical retaliation could be crossing a line. Also, threatening the neighbor's dog could be seen as a threat to someone else's property, which might not be wise.\n\nEmotionally, the author was scared and acting out of fear for their pet's safety. That's understandable, but the actions taken might be legally questionable. The neighbor's apathy is a problem, but the author's response of threatening to kill the dog or involving animal control could have been handled differently, perhaps by contacting authorities themselves first.\n\nSo, weighing it out, the author might not be in the wrong morally because they were protecting their pet, but legally or socially, their actions could be seen as over the line. However, the question is about whether they're the asshole, which is more about social judgment. In AITA terms, if the neighbor is negligent and the author acted out of fear, the author might not be the asshole. But the way they handled it (threats and physical violence to the dog) could make them the AITA. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a chance of A depending on the perspective.\n"
