They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation involves two scenarios where the neighbor's large dog (Beef Boy) attacked their small dog.\n\nFirst, in the first incident, Beef Boy jumps the wall and attacks the author's dog. The author pulls the dog off. Then, the next day, the same thing happens. This time, the author kicks Beef Boy twice to get him off. The neighbor only says sorry but doesn't take action like putting a leash on the dog or training it. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again, and also threatens the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, you have a duty to protect your property and pets. If a neighbor's dog is causing harm, taking reasonable action to protect your own property (which includes pets) is justified. However, using violence like kicking could be a problem. If the dog was attacking the author's pet, self-defense might be a factor here, but the specifics depend on local laws. In some areas, you might be allowed to use reasonable force to protect your pets. However, threatening to kill the dog might cross a line unless you have prior notice from authorities or the dog is known to be dangerous.\n\nEthically, the author's actions were driven by fear and a desire to protect their small dog. The neighbor's inaction in controlling their aggressive dog could be seen as negligent. The author's threats might be seen as justified if the neighbor isn't addressing the problem. However, the use of physical force (kicking) could be considered excessive. The neighbor's lack of action is also a factor here; if they didn't take steps to prevent future incidents, the responsibility isn't solely on the author.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author's actions were in response to an immediate threat to their pet. The threats might be harsh, but the underlying cause is the neighbor's failure to control their dog. The author is protecting their own property, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
