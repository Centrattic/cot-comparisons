They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dog attack from the neighbor's large dog, and the author defending their small dog by kicking the neighbor's dog when it attacked again. The neighbor didn't do anything to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and ethical standards regarding animal interactions. In many places, you have the right to protect your own property, which can include pets. If an animal is attacking yours, some level of defense might be justified. However, the method used (kicking the dog) could be a point of contention. Was it necessary? The author says they kicked the dog once, then again harder. If the dog was actively attacking and posing a threat to their pet, self-defense could be a factor. But the threat level matters. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's role is important. If they knew their dog was a repeat offender and didn't take steps to control it, like keeping it on a leash or in a fenced area, they might be at fault. The author's threat to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again might be seen as excessive, but given the circumstances, it's understandable if they feel their pet's life is in danger. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, using force to protect your animals is allowed, but the force must be reasonable. Kicking the dog could be considered reasonable if it was an immediate threat. However, threatening to kill the dog might be a legal issue unless there's a specific law allowing that. The neighbor's apathy is concerning because they didn't take steps to prevent future incidents, which could make them partially responsible.\n\nEthically, the author's actions are driven by protecting their pet, which is a strong motive. The neighbor's lack of action could mean they're neglecting their responsibility as a pet owner. However, the author's physical retaliation and threats might be seen as over the line, depending on cultural norms and local laws. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is trying to protect their pet from a dangerous dog. The neighbor didn't act responsibly. The author's actions might be justified in protecting their own animal, but the method and threats could be seen as overreacting. However, given the immediate threat, kicking the dog to stop an attack could be reasonable. The final answer might hinge on whether the force was necessary and proportionate. Since the dog was attacking their pet, using force to stop it is defensible. The threats might be problematic, but the main issue is the neighbor's negligence. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
