They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting their neighbor's dog that jumped into their backyard. The key points here are about self-defense for pets and the neighbor's responsibility.\n\nFirst, the neighbor got a large dog, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix, which is a breed often associated with being protective or aggressive. The writer mentions their own small dog could be in danger. The first time the dog jumped the wall, the writer tried to pull it off. The next day, the dog attacked again, even getting the mouth around their small dog's neck. The writer then kicked the dog to make it let go.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer's actions were justified. In many places, the law allows for reasonable force to protect one's property or animals. Since the neighbor's dog was attacking without warning and in a dangerous way, using force to stop it might be considered reasonable. However, the threat to kill the dog is a line that could be problematic. While threatening to call animal control is a valid step, threatening to kill could be seen as excessive or threatening violence, which might not be legally protected. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor; they didn't take steps to control their dog properly. The writer probably felt their small dog was in immediate danger, so acting to stop the attack makes sense. But the threat to kill might be where they cross into being in the wrong. So the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because of the threat, even if the initial action was justified. Alternatively, if the threat was just a reaction to protect their pet and the neighbor was negligent, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a bit of a gray area, but the threat to kill might be the key point here.\n"
