They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. From the context provided, the author's dog was attacked by the neighbor's larger dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and chased the author's dog. The second time, the neighbor's dog got on the author's dog and bit its neck. The author kicked the dog to make it let go and then threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overreacted. Let me break down the factors. The author was protecting their own dog from what they perceived as a life-threatening attack. The neighbor's dog is a large breed that could indeed cause serious harm to a smaller dog. The author's actions were immediate and in response to an ongoing attack. The neighbor's response was dismissive, not taking steps to secure their dog. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, defending one's property and pets is generally acceptable, especially when there's a threat of harm. However, the method used (kicking) might be seen as excessive, although in the heat of the moment, it might be considered a reasonable reaction to stop the attack. The threats made afterward, however, could be problematic. Threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious statement and might be seen as crossing a line, even if justified by the circumstances. \n\nThe neighbor's lack of responsibility in securing their dog is a significant point. If the neighbor didn't take measures to prevent the dog from escaping, they might share some responsibility. But the author's threats could still be seen as an overreaction, depending on local laws and societal norms. In some places, using lethal force to protect property (even a pet) might not be justified unless there's an immediate threat. However, the author was trying to protect their pet from a real threat, so their actions could be seen as defensive.\n\nBalancing both sides, the author's intent was to protect their dog, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog contributes to the problem. However, the threats made by the author, while understandable, might be considered extreme. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The immediate action to stop the attack might be justified, but the threats could be seen as crossing a line. But given the context of the neighbor's apathy and the danger posed, the author's actions might be understandable. I think the answer hinges on whether the threats are considered disproportionate. Maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's some nuance here.\n"
