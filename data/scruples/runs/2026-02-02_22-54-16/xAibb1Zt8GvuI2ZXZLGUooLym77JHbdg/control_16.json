They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after their actions towards the neighbor's dog. The situation involves two dogs, one of which jumped the wall twice and attacked the other. The author kicked the dog in self-defense and threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's dog attacked the other dog twice without being leashed. The author was protecting their own pet, which is a valid concern since the dog could have been harmed. The author's actions to stop the attack\u2014kicking the dog\u2014seem like a direct response to immediate danger. In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals. Kicking might be considered reasonable in that moment to prevent injury.\n\nHowever, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be crossing a line. Even though the neighbor was apologetic but didn't take action, the author's threats could be seen as excessive. Legally, there's usually a process for handling such incidents, like reporting to authorities instead of taking matters into one's own hands. Also, trespassing laws might apply if the dog entered the property, but the author's threat to act against the neighbor for trespassing could be problematic, especially if not done through proper channels.\n\nEmotionally, the author was clearly upset, which can cloud judgment. But the key factors are the necessity of their actions and whether they were proportionate. The kicks were in response to an active attack, which might be justified. However, the threats afterward might not be legally or socially acceptable. The neighbor's inaction is also a point\u2014maybe they didn't take the issue seriously, but the author's response should still be measured.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are specific laws about protecting pets from attacks. If the neighbor's dog isn't properly leashed, the owner could be liable. The author might have the right to defend their pet, but the method and subsequent threats need to be considered. Kicking a dog could be considered animal cruelty if not necessary, but if it was to stop a life-threatening attack, it might be justified.\n\nOverall, the author's actions during the attack might be seen as self-defense, but the threats afterward are likely where they go wrong. Threats to kill someone's pet or take vigilante action aren't advisable and could lead to legal issues. The neighbor's apathy is a problem, but the author should handle it through proper means like speaking to them again, contacting local authorities, or following community guidelines instead of making threats.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is partially in the wrong for the threats but not for the immediate action. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall, considering both actions and threats, the answer might be A, but I need to check if the initial action is justified. If the kicks were necessary to stop the attack, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the threats are definitely an issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the threats make them the asshole. In the context of the situation, the author's threats might be seen as excessive, so the answer is A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
