They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard and attacked their own dog. The author kicked the neighbor's dog twice when it was attacking their small dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large mix that jumped the wall twice and attacked the smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to intervene without violence. The second time, when the dog was on the author's dog's neck, the author kicked the dog to stop it. The neighbor seemed apologetic but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense and protecting property. In many jurisdictions, you can defend your property, including pets, from immediate threats. Since the dog was attacking the author's dog, the response might be seen as necessary to prevent harm. However, the use of force needs to be reasonable. Kicking the dog might be seen as a reasonable action in the moment to stop the attack, especially since it was in self-defense of their own pet.\n\nThe neighbor's inaction is also a factor. If the neighbor wasn't taking steps to control their dog, the author might feel justified in taking matters into their own hands. The threat to call animal control or take extreme measures could be seen as a warning, which is common in such situations to prevent future incidents.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the method used. Kicking a dog, even in defense, could be considered excessive depending on the circumstances. But given the urgency and the immediate danger to their pet, it's debatable. The author also made it clear they would act if the dog endangered their pet again, which is understandable for safety.\n\nIn terms of the neighbor's apathy, they might be in the wrong for not taking responsibility. The author's actions might be a justified response to the neighbor's negligence.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were in defense of their property and pet. The response was a direct reaction to an ongoing attack. Unless there were laws against such actions in their area, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The neighbor's failure to control their dog plays a significant role here.\n"
