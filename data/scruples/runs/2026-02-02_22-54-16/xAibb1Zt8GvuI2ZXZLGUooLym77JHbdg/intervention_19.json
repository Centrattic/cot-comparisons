They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a small dog, and the neighbor's large dog keeps jumping over the wall to attack it. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off, and the neighbor came over to get their dog. The second time, the dog got my dog by the neck, so the author kicked the dog twice to make it release. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and also mentioned trespassing.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: protecting one's own dog from a potentially dangerous situation. The neighbor's dog is aggressive and uncontrolled, leading to two incidents where it attacks. The author acted to defend their pet, using physical force when necessary. Then the neighbor's response was just an apology without taking any concrete steps to prevent future incidents.\n\nLegally, I think if someone's pet is attacking another, you might have a duty to protect your own. Using reasonable force to protect an animal could be justified. Kicking the dog to stop it from choking the other dog might be considered a reasonable action in self-defense for the pet. However, the threats of killing the dog or calling animal control could be problematic. Threats to kill might escalate the situation, even if made in a moment of panic or fear. But given the context of the dog's behavior, the author might be within their rights to take such measures if the neighbor doesn't act responsibly.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they're not doing anything to secure their dog, like keeping it on a leash or mending the fence, their negligence contributes to the problem. The author's actions seem driven by fear for their dog's safety, which is understandable. The threat to kill the dog is harsh, but if it's meant as a warning to prevent future attacks, maybe it's a proportionate response to the neighbor's inaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were likely in self-defense for their pet, and the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
