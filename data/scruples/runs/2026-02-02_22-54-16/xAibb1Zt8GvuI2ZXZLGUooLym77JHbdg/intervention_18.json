They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their actions towards their neighbor's dog. The situation involves two dogs, one from the author and one from the neighbor. The neighbor's dog, Beef Boy, jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The author intervened both times, and on the second occasion, they kicked the dog to get it off their own dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had concerns about their small dog being vulnerable. The neighbor's dog was a larger breed, which is a red flag. The first incident was the dog jumping the wall and going after the smaller one. The author stopped it, but the neighbor didn't take action. The second time, the dog attacked again, and the author had to kick it. The neighbor's response was just an apology, no action to prevent future incidents.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can defend your property and pets if they're in immediate danger. The author's actions were to protect their own dog from a life-threatening situation. Kicking the dog might be seen as a reasonable force at the moment to prevent harm. However, there's a line between self-defense and excessive force. The author did try to get the dog off without causing serious harm, which might support their side.\n\nEmotionally, the author was scared and reacting in the moment. The neighbor's lack of action is also a point. They should have kept their dog under control, maybe with a leash or a secure fence. The author's threats afterward (calling animal control or killing the dog) might be extreme, but given the repeated incidents, it's understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they used proportional force to protect their pet immediately, they might not be. But if they threatened to kill the dog, that's another issue. However, the threats came after the fact, maybe as a warning. The neighbor's negligence in not controlling their dog could shift some responsibility away from the author.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the immediate danger to their dog, the neighbor's inaction, and the author's intent to protect, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are protection of property/pets and the neighbor's failure to prevent the attacks. The author's actions were in response to a direct threat, so they're justified.\n"
