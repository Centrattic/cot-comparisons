They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation involving their dog and a neighbor's dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a small dog, a mix of Chihuahua and Miniature Pinscher, which is small and vulnerable. The new neighbor next door got a large, beefy mix of a Pitbull and German Shepherd. The neighbor's dog, called Beef Boy, jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the second time, when the dog was attacking again, the author kicked it. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (option A) or not (option B). \n\nLet me break down the key points. The neighbor's dog attacked the author's dog twice. The first time, the author intervened physically to stop the attack. The second time, when the dog was on the author's property and attacking again, the author kicked it. The neighbor didn't take steps to prevent this, just apologized each time. The author then made threats of calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in many places, you have the right to protect your property and pets. If the neighbor's dog is a danger, the owner is responsible for ensuring their dog is controlled. The author's actions to stop the attack could be seen as necessary self-defense for their pet. However, using violence (kicking) might be seen as excessive, but given the immediate threat to their small dog, it could be justified. The threats made afterward are more problematic. Threatening to kill someone's pet is a serious matter and could be illegal or at least unethical. However, the neighbor's inaction and the dog's repeated trespassing into the yard might mitigate the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is also a factor. If the dog is a known aggressive animal, the owner should have taken precautions like a leash or muzzle. The neighbor's apology without action suggests negligence. In this case, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the threats, even if understandable in the heat of the moment, might still be considered over the line. The author could have opted to involve authorities instead of making direct threats.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author acted in defense of their pet but escalated the situation with threats. The neighbor failed to control their dog. The author's actions to kick the dog might be justified as self-defense, but the threats could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the context of the neighbor's inaction and the dog's aggression, the author's actions could be seen as justified, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the threats themselves are a red flag. Yet, considering the situation, the author's intent was to protect their pet, which is a powerful justification.\n"
