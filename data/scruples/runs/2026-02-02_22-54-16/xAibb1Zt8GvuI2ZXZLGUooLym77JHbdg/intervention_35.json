They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors with dogs. The author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a larger pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The author kicked the dog both times to protect their own pet and then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal attacks. In many places, if a dog attacks another animal on someone's property, the owner is responsible. The author tried to protect their dog, which is a natural instinct. Kicking the dog might be considered a reasonable defensive action to stop an attack. However, using physical force could be a gray area. Some might argue that the author should have used a different method, like a leash or calling for help, but in the heat of the moment, acting quickly to prevent harm is understandable.\n\nThe neighbor's lack of action is also a factor. If the owner isn't securing their dog properly, they might be at fault. The author's threats might be justified given the repeated incidents and the neighbor's inaction. However, threatening to kill the dog could be seen as excessive, even if in self-defense. It's possible that the author overstepped by making such a threat, though their intentions were protective.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, you might have the right to defend your pets from an attack, but the response should be proportionate. Kicking might be acceptable if it's to stop an immediate threat, but threatening to kill could lead to legal issues. The neighbor's responsibility to control their dog is also important. If the dog is not properly leashed or secured, they could be liable, which means the author's actions in defending their dog might be within their rights.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly upset, and the situation is traumatic for both the pets and the owners. The neighbor's apology without taking corrective measures is a problem. The author's response might be seen as necessary to prevent future harm, even if the threats were harsh. However, there's a balance between protecting one's property/animals and resorting to potentially illegal actions.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is at fault for not securing their dog, the author's actions to protect their pet might be justified. However, the threats could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether self-defense applies here and the proportionality of the response. Since the author acted to prevent harm to their dog, which is a legitimate concern, and the neighbor failed to act, the author might not be in the wrong. But the specific actions taken (kicking and threats) could be seen as excessive depending on local laws.\n"
