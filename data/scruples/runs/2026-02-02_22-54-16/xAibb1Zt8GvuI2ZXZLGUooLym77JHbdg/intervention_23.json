They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the author responding by kicking the other dog and threatening to kill it or call animal control if it happens again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice to attack. The first time, they pulled the dog off, and the second time, they kicked it to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again. The author feels justified in their reaction because their dog's safety was at risk, especially since the neighbor didn't address the issue.\n\nNow, considering the laws and societal norms in the US (assuming the context is US-based), self-defense for pets can be a gray area. Generally, you can defend your property, which includes pets, but the level of force used matters. Kicking a dog in the heat of the moment might be considered excessive, but given the immediate threat to a small animal, some might see it as necessary to prevent harm. However, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic, even if it's a warning. Threats can sometimes be considered a criminal act, depending on jurisdiction. Also, the neighbor's lack of action is concerning; they should be responsible for their dog, especially if it's a known issue.\n\nThe author's main defense is protecting their pet. If the neighbor's dog is not properly contained, it's the neighbor's responsibility. But the author's response of using physical force and making threats might cross a line. However, given the urgency to save their dog, the reaction might be seen as understandable, even if not entirely appropriate.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, using force to protect a pet is sometimes allowed, but it's case-specific. The threat to kill the dog could lead to charges like harassment or criminal threats. However, the immediate threat might mitigate that. The key here is the proportionality of the response. Kicking the dog might be seen as reasonable to stop an attack, but the threats afterward might not be. The neighbor's inaction is also a problem, as they should have prevented the dog from escaping again.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong for acting to protect their pet, especially given the neighbor's negligence. However, the threats and possible excessive force could be seen as crossing a line. But given the high emotional context and the immediate danger to their small dog, the community might be more forgiving. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with some caveats about the threats and the need for legal action instead of taking matters into own hands.\n"
