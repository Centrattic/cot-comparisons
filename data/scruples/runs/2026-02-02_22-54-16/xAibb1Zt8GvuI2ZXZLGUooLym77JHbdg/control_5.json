They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their yard. \n\nFirst, the context: the author has a small dog, and their neighbor got a large, potentially aggressive pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, and the neighbor didn't take action. The second time, the dog was about to kill the author's dog, so the author kicked it to save their pet. Then they threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author was in the wrong. The key points are self-defense for their dog and the neighbor's responsibility. The author acted to protect their own pet from an immediate threat. Kicking the dog was a direct response to an attack. However, threatening to kill the neighbor's dog might be legally and ethically problematic. In many places, you can't take lethal action against someone else's property without legal consequences, even in defense of your own property. Also, the neighbor's apathy is an issue; they didn't take steps to control their dog, which is their responsibility.\n\nBut the author's actions to stop the immediate danger (kicking the dog) might be seen as justified under self-defense for their pet. However, the threats afterward could be considered threats of violence, which are not acceptable. The author should have considered legal means like calling animal control or contacting authorities instead of threatening the neighbor's dog.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions crossed the line from defense to aggression. The kicking could be justified as necessary to stop an attack, but the threats are problematic. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong. If the law considers defending one's property (the dog) as justifiable, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the threats might make them in the wrong. But the initial action was a reaction to an attack. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, using force to protect property can be allowed, but lethal force is usually for personal protection. Since the author didn't kill the dog but kicked it, maybe that's within reasonable defense. The neighbor's negligence is also a factor here. So the author's actions might not be in the wrong for defending their dog, but the threats are. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nGiven that the author's primary goal was to protect their own dog from imminent harm, their actions during the attack might be justified. The threats, though, are problematic. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for hurting the dog. Since the dog was attacking, the author's intervention could be seen as self-defense. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) for the action of kicking the dog, but the threats are a separate issue. The question focuses on the act of hurting the dog, not the threats. So the answer is B.\n"
