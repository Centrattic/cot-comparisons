They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two neighbors, one with a small dog and the other with a larger dog that jumped the wall and attacked. The author kicked the larger dog twice to save their own, and then threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. The author's dog was attacked by the neighbor's dog twice. During the second incident, the author kicked the dog to stop the attack. The neighbor didn't seem to take responsibility, just said sorry.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, protecting one's own property (in this case, the dog) is a common consideration. However, the method used to protect it might be questioned. Kicking a dog could be seen as excessive force, depending on the circumstances. If the dog was actively attacking and there was no other way to stop it, some might argue it's necessary. But others might say that using a weapon or calling for help would be better than using physical force that could harm the dog.\n\nThen there's the threat part. Threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as overreacting, even if the dog is a threat. However, given that the neighbor didn't take steps to prevent future incidents, the author might feel justified in trying to ensure their own dog's safety.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can't harm someone else's property (the dog) even in self-defense without some form of legal process. So the author might be liable if they injured the dog. But if it was in defense of their own dog, maybe there's some protection there. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they knew the dog was a threat and didn't control it, they could be at fault. The author might feel justified in standing up for themselves, especially after two incidents.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is proportionality of response. Kicking the dog hard enough to make it let go might be seen as reasonable to prevent harm to their own dog. However, the threat to kill the dog is more problematic. Threatening violence might be crossing a line, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were in the immediate moment of danger. Reacting in the heat of the moment can sometimes be considered a mitigating factor. However, threatening to kill the dog later is a separate issue. It's not just about self-defense during the attack but also about the threats made afterward.\n\nIn terms of community norms, people usually try to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. The neighbor's lack of action might be a problem, but the author's response might still be seen as over the top, especially the threat to kill. People might expect the author to try other methods first, like talking to the neighbor more formally, involving authorities, or using legal channels.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The immediate action to stop the attack might be justified, but the threats afterward could make the author at fault. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The answer would depend on whether the threats and the force used were excessive. Since the author did take action to protect their dog, but also made threats, there's a balance. The user might be leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were protecting their pet, but others might say the threats make them the asshole. It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering that the neighbor didn't act responsibly, the author's actions might be more understandable. However, the method of response (kicking and threatening) could be seen as crossing a line. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the threats and possible excessive force, but others might say B. Alternatively, maybe it's a split, but according to the options, it's either A or B. Given that the author took direct action in the moment, maybe B is the answer. But the threats are a problem. Hmm.\n"
