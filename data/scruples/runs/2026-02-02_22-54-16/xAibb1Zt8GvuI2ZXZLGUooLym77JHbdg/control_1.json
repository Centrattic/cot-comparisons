They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So the author is the one who kicked the neighbor's dog to protect their own small dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the neighbor's dog is a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The author has a small dog which the neighbor's dog attacked twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and attacked, so the author pulled the dog off. The next day, the same dog attacked again, bit their dog's neck, and the author kicked the neighbor's dog to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are self-defense of the pet and the neighbor's responsibility. In many places, if an animal is attacking your pet, you can act to protect your own animal. However, the method used (kicking the dog) might be a factor. Kicking could be considered excessive, but if the dog was actively attacking and the owner didn't have a leash, maybe the author had no other option. Also, threatening to kill the dog might be an issue, depending on local laws and what's considered reasonable action. The neighbor's lack of action (not leashing the dog, not training it) could contribute to the situation. \n\nBut the author's actions were in defense of their own pet, which is a valid concern. However, the threat to kill might be seen as over the top, even if the neighbor was negligent. The author might be justified in protecting their pet, but the specific actions (kicking and threatening to kill) could be seen as excessive or aggressive. Also, the neighbor's inaction is part of the problem, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of any wrongdoing. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are laws about how to handle animal conflicts. For example, if the author used reasonable force to protect their pet, it's acceptable. Kicking might be considered reasonable if it's the only way to stop the attack, but maybe there's a line between defensive action and causing unnecessary harm. The threat to kill the dog could be problematic because it involves premeditated harm beyond what's necessary for defense. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were in defense of their pet, which is understandable, but the method and the threats might cross into being inappropriate. It's a bit of a balance between justifiable self-defense and overreacting. Since the author took action to protect their animal and the neighbor was negligent, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But the kick and threats could be seen as the problem. However, given that the neighbor didn't take responsibility, maybe the author's actions are more understandable. I think the answer is B (No), because the author was protecting their own pet from a dangerous dog that the neighbor failed to control. But there's a nuance here where the method and threats might be questionable. However, the main issue is the neighbor's negligence, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
