They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has a small dog, and their neighbor got a large pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the person's dog. The first time, the person pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the person's dog by the neck, so the person kicked it twice to make it let go. They then threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action. The person is now questioning if they overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the person's actions were justified. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Self-defense for the pet**: When an animal is being attacked, especially a small dog by a larger one, the owner might feel compelled to act quickly. Kicking the dog to prevent harm to their pet could be seen as an immediate response to protect their animal. However, the use of force here is a key point. Was kicking the dog necessary and proportionate?\n\n2. **Threats made to the neighbor**: The person told the neighbor that if the dog attacked again, they'd call animal control or kill it. Also, they threatened the neighbor if the dog trespassed again. Threats of violence or harm, even in the context of protecting a pet, can be legally problematic. Depending on local laws, making threats against someone's property or person could be considered a civil or even criminal issue.\n\n3. **Neighbor's responsibility**: The neighbor's dog is a known threat, and they didn't take steps to control it, like keeping it on a leash or ensuring the fence was secure. Their apathy is a problem because they should be responsible for their dog's actions. However, the person's response to that apathy is what's in question.\n\n4. **Legal implications**: In many jurisdictions, if a dog attacks another animal on your property, you may have the right to defend your pet. However, using physical force that harms the other dog could lead to liability issues. The person's threat to kill the dog might be seen as over the line, especially if they don't involve authorities first.\n\n5. **Emotional state**: The person was shaken up and acted in the heat of the moment. While understandable, emotions can cloud judgment, and actions taken in panic or fear might not be the most prudent legally or ethically.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the person's immediate action to protect their dog by kicking the attacking dog might be seen as a reasonable defensive action in the moment. However, the subsequent threats to the neighbor\u2014especially the threat to kill the dog\u2014could be problematic. Threats can be considered as harassment or even criminal threats, depending on the local laws. Additionally, the person didn't involve animal control or legal authorities immediately, which is a proper channel for such issues.\n\nThe neighbor's lack of responsibility is definitely part of the problem, but the person's response crosses into threatening behavior, which is a red flag. Even if the neighbor was at fault, the person's threats might not be justified and could lead to legal trouble for them as well. So, while the initial act of defending the dog might be understandable, the threats and aggressive posturing might place the person in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the threats made, even though the initial action to protect the dog was reactive. The threats could be seen as disproportionate and legally risky, making the person the asshole in this scenario.\n"
