They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their neighbor's dog. The situation involves two dogs, one from the neighbor's house that jumps the wall and attacks the author's smaller dog. The author ends up kicking the neighbor's dog twice to get it off their dog. They also threaten to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again, and mention doing something if the neighbor trespasses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects here. In many jurisdictions, there are laws about protecting pets from harm. If a dog is attacking another animal, the owner has a duty to control their pet. The neighbor's dog is clearly a danger since it's a large breed that's twice attacked and attempted to kill the smaller dog. The author acted in what they perceive as self-defense for their pet. \n\nHowever, the author used force against the neighbor's dog. Kicking the dog could be seen as excessive or even illegal, depending on local laws. Owners are usually supposed to protect their pets but not harm others' animals in the process. If the author's actions caused injury to the neighbor's dog, they might be liable for damages. Also, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic, as it might be considered a criminal threat or endangering another's property.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's inaction is concerning. If they knew their dog was dangerous and didn't take steps to control it (like keeping it on a leash or properly contained), they might be at fault. The neighbor's response of just apologizing without taking corrective measures shows negligence.\n\nEthically, the author's main motive is protecting their pet, which is understandable. But the method used\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014could be seen as over the top. There might be more appropriate steps, like calling animal control themselves, documenting the incidents, or confronting the neighbor with a call to action beyond just threats.\n\nSo, the key points are: the neighbor's dog is dangerous and their owner is negligent; the author acted to protect their pet but used potentially illegal force and threats. The balance here is between the right to protect one's property (the dog) and the means taken to do so. Depending on the laws, the author might be in the wrong for using force and threats, even if their intention was good. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor, but the question is specifically about the author's actions.\n"
