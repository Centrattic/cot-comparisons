They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs, one from the writer's home and one from the neighbor's. The neighbor's dog is a large mix that jumped the wall and attacked the writer's smaller dog. The writer kicked the dog to stop it, and then threatened the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The writer's dog is much smaller, so the risk of serious harm is real. The neighbor's dog attacked twice, and the owner didn't take preventive measures. The writer tried to protect their dog, which is a natural instinct. Kicking the dog might be seen as a last resort when other methods failed. However, using physical force on another person's animal could be legally questionable. Then there's the threat to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. That's pretty serious. Threats can be legally problematic, depending on the jurisdiction. Also, trespassing by the dog might be a factor, but the neighbor's responsibility to control their dog is key here. The neighbor's apathy is an issue because they didn't address the dog's behavior after the first incident. So, the writer was protecting their property (their dog) from a threat. But the methods used\u2014kicking and making threats\u2014might be where the line is crossed. However, given the immediate danger, self-defense for the pet could justify the action. The neighbor's lack of action might also contribute to the situation. It's a bit of a gray area. In some places, you have the right to defend your property, but the method of defense needs to be proportional. Kicking a large dog might be excessive, but if it was the only way to stop it, maybe not. The threats, though, could be an issue. Overall, the writer might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their dog, but there are elements that could be seen as overreacting. However, considering the neighbor's negligence, the writer's actions might be justified. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
