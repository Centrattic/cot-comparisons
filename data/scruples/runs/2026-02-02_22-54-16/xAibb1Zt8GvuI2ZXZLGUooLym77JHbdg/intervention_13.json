They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog repeatedly attacking their small dog, and the author taking action by kicking the dog and threatening the neighbor.\n\nFirst, the author's actions are in response to immediate threats to their pet. The first incident had the neighbor's dog jumping the wall and attacking, which the author had to physically intervene to stop. The second time was even more dire, with the dog's mouth around the small dog's neck. The author's fear for their pet's safety is understandable. They kicked the dog to save their own, which is a defensive action to prevent harm.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can defend your property, including pets, from immediate threats. However, the line between defense and assault can be thin. Kicking the dog might be considered excessive force, especially if it injured the dog. The author also threatened to kill or call animal control, which could be problematic if not done through proper channels.\n\nThe neighbor's response was apathetic, not addressing the dog's behavior. This lack of responsibility might place some blame on them for not properly controlling their pet. But the author's threats and physical actions could also be seen as overreacting, depending on local laws. If the author had called the authorities or taken legal steps instead of using physical force, it might have been a more appropriate response.\n\nThe key points are the immediate danger to the pet, the proportionality of the response, and the neighbor's failure to secure their dog. The author's actions were driven by fear and a desire to protect their pet, which is a strong defense, but the method used might be legally questionable. However, given the context of protecting a small dog from a much larger, aggressive dog, many might empathize with the author's actions, even if they technically overstepped.\n"
