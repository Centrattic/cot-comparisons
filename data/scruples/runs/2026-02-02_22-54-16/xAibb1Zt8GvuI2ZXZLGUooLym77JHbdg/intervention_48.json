They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their smaller dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks, and the AITA pulls it off. The next day, the dog attacks again, and the AITA kicks it to get it off their dog. They then threaten the neighbor to either control their dog or face consequences like calling animal control or killing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and societal norms. In many places, you have the right to protect your property and pets from harm. If a dog is attacking another, it's understandable to intervene. However, the method used matters. Kicking the attacking dog might be seen as a reasonable defensive action to stop an attack, but it's important to check if that's legally acceptable. Some jurisdictions might have specific laws about using force against animals.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is another angle. They have a large dog that's uncontrolled and allowed to trespass, leading to attacks. The neighbor's apathy and lack of action (like not leashing the dog or training it) could make them at fault. The AITA's threats might be justified if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, but threatening to kill the dog could push things into a gray area. However, if the dog is a known danger, the AITA might have a valid reason.\n\nEmotional state is also a factor. The AITA was clearly shaken and acting to protect their pet. While the threats might come off as harsh, the underlying issue is the neighbor's negligence. The AITA's actions were in defense of their dog, which could be seen as reasonable.\n\nPotential issues: The kicking might be seen as excessive if the dog stopped attacking. But since the dog had the smaller dog by the neck, using force to separate them seems necessary. The threats could be problematic, but if the neighbor continues to neglect their dog, the AITA might feel those threats are necessary for future prevention.\n\nIn summary, the AITA's actions were in self-defense and protecting their pet, which is generally not in the wrong. The neighbor's negligence is the bigger issue here. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
