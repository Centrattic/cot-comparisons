They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two neighbors and their dogs.\n\nFirst, the author has a small dog, and the neighbor got a large, possibly aggressive breed. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked it to make it let go and then threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nNow, considering the laws and common practices. In many places, dog owners are responsible for their pets' behavior. If a dog is a danger to others, the owner should control it, maybe with a leash or fence. The neighbor's dog repeatedly jumped the wall, which is a sign of poor containment. That's on the neighbor for not securing their dog properly.\n\nThe author's actions: the first time, trying to intervene. The second time, using force to protect their dog. Kicking the dog might be a bit aggressive, but in a moment of panic to save a small dog from a large one, it might be understandable. The threats after could be seen as harsh, but given the neighbor's inaction, the author felt justified in defending their pet.\n\nSo, the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog. The author's actions were in self-defense for their dog. Even though the threats were strong, the situation was escalating. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
