They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their neighbor's dog jumping into their yard and attacking their smaller dog twice. The author defends their dog by kicking the bigger dog and threatening to call animal control or kill it if it happens again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent it from happening again. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if others agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The neighbor's dog was aggressive and uncontrolled, leading to two attacks. The author's main concern is protecting their small dog from a potentially fatal attack. When the dog attacked the second time, the author kicked it to make it release their dog. Kicking might be considered excessive force, but the intent was to prevent harm to their pet. \n\nNext, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control if the behavior continues. Threats can be problematic, especially if they involve violence. However, given the dog's aggression and the neighbor's lack of action, the author might feel justified in trying to prevent future attacks. The neighbor's apathy is a factor here\u2014since they didn't do anything to restrain the dog, the author might feel compelled to take matters into their own hands.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play. In many places, you can take reasonable steps to protect your property (including pets) from immediate threats. Kicking the dog could be seen as a defensive action. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog might not be legally sound unless there's a specific law allowing that. The neighbor could potentially have legal recourse if the author's actions caused harm to their dog, or if the threats are considered intimidation.\n\nEmotionally, the author was clearly shaken and protective. The neighbor's response was inadequate, which might have escalated the situation. The key factors are the proportionality of the response and the immediate threat. Kicking the dog to stop an attack could be justified self-defense for their pet. However, the threats made afterward could be seen as overreaching, even if the intent was to prevent future incidents.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's a concept of \"imminent threat\" where you can act to stop an immediate danger. The author's actions during the attack were in response to that. The threats afterward might be considered harassment if they're not legal and not directed at the neighbor directly. But the neighbor did apologize, so maybe there's room for negotiation.\n\nAnother angle is the neighbor's responsibility. If the dog is a known danger and they're not controlling it, they might be liable. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort. However, the method of dealing with it (kicking and threats) might not be the best approach, even if the intent is good.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The immediate defensive actions during the attack might be justified, but the threats afterward could be problematic. The author's motivation is to protect their pet, which is understandable. Whether they're in the wrong would depend on local laws and the specifics of how the threats were made. Since the user is asking for a general assessment without legal specifics, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong for defending their pet, but the threats could be an issue. However, given the neighbor's inaction and the dog's aggression, the author's reaction might be seen as reasonable in the context of protecting their own animal.\n"
