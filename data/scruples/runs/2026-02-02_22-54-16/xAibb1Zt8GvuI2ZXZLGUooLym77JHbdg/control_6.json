They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog from the neighbor's house jumping the wall and attacking their dog. The author then kicks the dog to defend their own pet and threatens the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality and morality of the author's actions. In many places, there are laws regarding the defense of property and animals. If the neighbor's dog is uncontrolled and poses a threat, the owner is responsible. The author's action of kicking the dog to save their own might be considered a reasonable act of defense, especially since the attacking dog was in the process of harming their pet. However, using physical force could be a point of contention. Was there a proportionate response here? Kicking the dog might be seen as excessive if there were other ways to intervene, like using an object to separate them.\n\nThen there's the threat part. Threatening to kill the dog or call animal control is a strong response. Depending on local laws, threatening someone else's property (the dog) could be problematic. But if the dog is a known danger, the author might feel justified in holding the neighbor accountable. The neighbor's apathy is another factor; if they're not taking responsibility for their dog's behavior, the author might feel compelled to take matters into their own hands.\n\nBut where does the line get drawn? The author did act to prevent harm to their pet, which is a valid concern. However, the method of defense (kicking the dog) and the subsequent threats might be seen as over the top. The neighbor might have legal recourse if the author's actions caused injury to their dog, especially if it was done in a non-justifiable manner. On the other hand, the neighbor's failure to control their dog is a significant issue. In many jurisdictions, dog owners are liable for their pets' actions, especially if the dog is a known aggressive breed.\n\nThe author's response could be considered self-defense in protecting their property (their dog). However, the use of force must be proportionate. Kicking a dog that's attacking another pet might be necessary to stop the immediate threat, but it's a gray area. The threat of killing the dog might be illegal in some places unless the dog is a declared dangerous animal. The author's intent was to prevent future attacks, which is understandable, but the method of communication (threatening the neighbor) is likely to escalate the situation.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be justified in protecting their own dog, but the specific methods (kicking the dog and making threats) could be problematic. The neighbor's lack of responsibility is also a key factor. However, the line between defense and overreaction is thin here. Depending on local laws, the author might have some legal standing, but the way they handled it could still be seen as the wrong approach.\n"
