They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two neighbors: the author has a small dog, and the new neighbor has a large pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the author's dog. The first time, the author pulls the dog off, but the next day, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks it to make it let go. The author then threatens the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happens again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the neighbor's dog is uncontrolled, attacks the author's dog twice, and the neighbor is apathetic. The author's actions were to protect their own dog. Now, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, in terms of self-defense for pets. In many places, you have the right to protect your property, which includes your pets. If a dog is attacking yours, taking action to stop it might be justified. However, the method used (kicking) could be a factor. Kicking could be considered excessive force if the dog wasn't a danger to the author, but since it was attacking the dog, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's responsibility is a factor. If they didn't secure their dog properly, they might be at fault. The author's threats (calling animal control or killing the dog) might be seen as excessive, but given the danger to their own pet, it could be understandable. However, threatening to kill might be crossing a line, even if the intent is to prevent future attacks.\n\nSo, considering the options: the author's actions were in self-defense for their dog, but the threats might be too harsh. However, the neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog is a big part of the problem. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted to protect their animal. But maybe the threats are over the top.\n\nHmm. I think the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the immediate actions were to stop an attack, but the threats might be an issue. However, in these kinds of situations, people are often advised to contact local authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands. But given the urgency, maybe the author wasn't wrong. Still, the question is about being in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is the asshole. The neighbor is likely at fault for not controlling the dog. The author's actions to protect their own dog could be justified, even if the threats are a bit extreme. So the answer is B.\n"
