They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives next to a new family who got a large dog, a pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The author has a small dog and is concerned about safety. The dog from the neighbor's house jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the author's dog by the neck, so the author kicked it hard to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent it from happening again. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nIn many places, laws regarding animals and property are clear. If the neighbor's dog is a threat, the owner is responsible for containing it. If the dog is off-leash and trespassing, the owner could be at fault for not controlling their pet. The author's actions were in defense of their own pet. Kicking the dog to protect their own animal might be justified as a last resort when trying to prevent harm. However, physically harming someone else's property (the dog) can be legally problematic. Depending on local laws, the author might be liable for damaging the neighbor's dog. But if the dog was attacking their own pet, self-defense for the animal could be a factor.\n\nLegally, the neighbor's dog jumping the fence and attacking could be considered a trespassing and a threat. The neighbor's inaction after the first incident is concerning. The author's response to protect their pet is understandable, but threatening to kill the dog might be excessive. However, in some jurisdictions, if an animal is a known danger, the owner might have the right to take action. But this varies a lot by location.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly upset and scared for their small dog. The neighbor's apathy after the first incident likely contributed to the author feeling the need to take more drastic measures the second time. The neighbor's failure to secure their dog and prevent it from attacking could be seen as negligent.\n\nHowever, using physical force against another person's dog, even in defense, might not be legally or ethically justified. The author could have tried other methods first, like using a barrier, calling the neighbor, or contacting authorities. Kicking the dog could be seen as excessive, even if it was to save their own pet. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a serious threat and could have legal repercussions.\n\nBut given that the neighbor didn't take responsibility, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to negligence. The key here is whether the author overstepped in their response. The author's intent was to protect their dog, which is a strong justification. However, the method used (kicking) and the threats made might be considered over the top. There's also the issue of trespassing if the neighbor's dog was on the author's property, which could complicate things.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is negligent for not controlling their dog, the author's actions could be seen as justified in self-defense for their pet. However, the threats and physical harm to the dog might make the author at least partially responsible. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to protect their animal, though the method could be questioned.\n"
