They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. Let me break down the context and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's dog is a large breed mix, and the writer has a small dog. The dog from the neighbor's side jumped the wall twice, attacking the writer's small dog. The first time, the writer tried to pull it off. The second time, the dog got a hold of the small dog's neck, so the writer kicked it hard enough to make it let go. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about the dog trespassing.\n\nNow, the key points here. The writer acted in defense of their own dog's life. The neighbor's dog posed a clear threat, especially since it's a large breed that could severely injure a small dog. The writer's actions were immediate and in response to an ongoing attack. Kicking the dog to save their own pet could be seen as a reasonable self-defense measure for the pet. However, the threat to kill the dog might be more questionable. Threats can escalate situations, but the writer's intention was to prevent future attacks, which the neighbor hadn't addressed. The neighbor's apathy is also a factor here; they didn't take steps to control their dog despite the danger.\n\nIn terms of legality, using force to protect one's property or pets can be justified, but the proportionality of the force matters. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be considered reasonable, but the threat to kill could cross a line. However, the context is that the neighbor hadn't taken any action, so the writer's frustration is understandable. Emotionally, the writer was shaken and acted out of fear for their pet's safety.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer's actions were in self-defense for their dog, and the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their pet. The writer might have overstepped with the threats, but the core issue is the neighbor's negligence. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
