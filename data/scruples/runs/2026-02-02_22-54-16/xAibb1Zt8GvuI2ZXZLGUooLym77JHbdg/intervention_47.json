They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that attacked their own dog. The author kicked the neighbor's dog twice to save their small dog, which the neighbor's larger dog had attacked. The neighbor seemed apathetic and only said sorry without taking action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a mix of a pitbull and a German Shepherd, which are both breeds often associated with being strong and potentially aggressive. The author's dog is small, so a serious injury or death is a real possibility here. The dog jumped the wall twice, attacking the author's dog. The first time, the author pulled the dog off, but the neighbor didn't seem to take it seriously. The second time, the dog had the author's dog by the neck, prompting the author to kick it to save their pet.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can act to protect your property (which includes your pets) from immediate harm. Self-defense laws for animals might apply here, allowing the owner to take necessary actions to prevent harm. The author's response was to kick the dog when it was actively attacking, which could be seen as a reasonable defensive action to stop the threat. However, using force to the point of potentially harming the neighbor's dog could be a gray area, depending on local laws. \n\nEthically, the author's motivation was to protect their own pet. The neighbor's lack of action in controlling their dog is problematic. If the neighbor had properly secured their dog or taken responsibility after the first incident, the second attack might have been prevented. The author's threats after the second incident (calling animal control or killing the dog) are more contentious, but the immediate action during the attack (kicking the dog) seems justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a key point. If they're not taking steps to prevent their dog from being a danger, they share responsibility. The author's response was a direct reaction to an ongoing threat. However, some might argue that the author could have called for help or used less aggressive methods first. But in the heat of the moment, when their dog's life was at risk, a split-second decision to act forcefully makes sense.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the immediate danger to their pet and the neighbor's lack of responsibility, the author's actions can be seen as protective and necessary. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
