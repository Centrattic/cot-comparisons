They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for threatening their neighbor's dog after it attacked their smaller dog twice. \n\nFirst, the context: They live next door to a family with a large, athletic dog that jumped the wall and went after their small dog. The first time, they pulled it off, and the neighbor just \"was sorry\" but didn't do anything. The second time, the dog jumped the wall again, attacked their dog, and the author kicked it hard to make it let go. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and mentioned trespassing.\n\nSo, the key points here are about self-defense and the neighbor's responsibility. In many jurisdictions, people have the right to protect their property and pets, even if it means using reasonable force. The first incident might not have required a threat, but the second time the dog attacked again and the neighbor didn't take action to prevent it, the author might feel justified in taking more forceful measures.\n\nHowever, there's a line between self-defense and excessive force. The author kicked the dog, which led to it letting go. Depending on the situation, if the dog was still on the neighbor's property and hadn't entered the author's yard, there might be issues. Also, threatening to kill the dog is a strong action. Animal control is a possible step, but saying they'd kill it might be seen as over the top.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they're not doing anything to control their dog, that's on them. But the author's response could be perceived as aggressive, especially if they didn't give the neighbor a chance to address the issue first. Maybe they should have tried to talk to the neighbor more formally or report the dog's behavior before resorting to threats and physical force.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's small dog is in danger. Repeated attacks without the owner taking action could justify some level of defense. The law often considers the immediate threat to safety. So if the dog was actively attacking, using force to stop it might be justified. But the exact situation details (like whether the dog was on their property when attacked, how much force was used) matter.\n\nThe threat of calling animal control or killing the dog might be excessive. While it's a right to protect their pet, the author's words could be seen as provocative. It's possible that a more measured approach, like documenting incidents and contacting authorities, would be better.\n\nSo, the author's actions in stopping the attack might be defensible, but the threats afterward could be where they cross the line. The neighbor's negligence is part of the problem, but the author's response might be too harsh. The answer depends on the laws in their area and the specifics of the incidents. Since the user is asking for a general opinion, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong for protecting their pet, but their threats might be problematic.\n"
