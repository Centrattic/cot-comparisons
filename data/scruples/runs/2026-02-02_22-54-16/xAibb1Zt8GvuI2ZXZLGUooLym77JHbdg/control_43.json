They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog.\n\nFirst, the context: the neighbor got a large dog, a pitbull/german shepard mix, which jumped the wall twice and attacked the user's smaller dog. The first time, the user pulled the dog off. The second time, the neighbor's dog was biting the user's dog's neck, prompting the user to kick the dog to make it let go.\n\nThe user is now questioning if they overreacted and if they're the asshole here. The neighbor only apologized without taking any action to prevent future incidents.\n\nKey points to consider: Self-defense for pets. In many jurisdictions, you can defend your property (which includes pets) if there's an imminent threat. The user's actions were to stop an ongoing attack. Kicking the dog when it was attacking might be within reasonable defense, especially since the dog was causing harm. However, the user also threatened to kill the dog or call animal control, which could be seen as excessive if not justified by local laws.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem too. They didn't take steps to secure the dog after the first incident. But the user's actions were in response to immediate danger. The user's threat might be harsh, but the underlying issue is the neighbor's failure to control their dog.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The immediate reaction (kicking the dog) to stop an attack is likely justified. The threats afterward are more questionable but might stem from fear and the neighbor's lack of responsibility. Overall, the user's actions were in defense of their pet, so they might not be in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
