They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the writer defending their pet by kicking the larger dog. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer has a small dog, and the neighbor's dog is a mix that could potentially be dangerous. The first incident happened when the neighbor's dog jumped over the wall and chased the writer's dog. The writer intervened to stop it. Then the next day, the same dog attacked again, even getting the writer's dog by the neck. The writer then kicked the dog to stop it, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense for the pet. In many jurisdictions, if a dog is attacking another animal, the owner has the right to intervene to prevent harm. The writer's actions seem to be in defense of their own pet's life. Kicking the dog might be seen as a reasonable reaction given the immediate threat. However, the neighbor's lack of action in controlling their dog is also a factor. The neighbor's apathy is concerning because they should be responsible for their pet's behavior. \n\nThe writer threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. While the wording is strong, the underlying issue is the neighbor's failure to control their dog. The writer's threat could be seen as a warning to the neighbor to take responsibility. However, the method of intervention\u2014kicking the dog\u2014might be considered excessive by some, but in the heat of the moment, it might be justified as a necessary action to protect the pet.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's dog trespassing and attacking another animal is a problem they need to address. The neighbor's apology without taking corrective actions (like leashing the dog, training, or using a fence) might be insufficient. The writer's response could be seen as a last resort after the neighbor failed to act.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, the right to protect one's property (including pets) is generally acknowledged. However, the use of force should be proportionate. Kicking a dog that's attacking another animal could be considered a reasonable act of defense. The threat to kill the dog might be more contentious, but if the dog is a known danger, calling animal control is a valid option.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer's actions seem justified given the circumstances. The neighbor's inaction is a significant factor here. The writer is protecting their pet from a clear threat, and their response is a reaction to the neighbor's negligence. Therefore, the answer would be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
