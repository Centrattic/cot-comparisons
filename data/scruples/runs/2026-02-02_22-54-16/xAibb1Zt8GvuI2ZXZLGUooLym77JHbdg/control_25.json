They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two neighbors with dogs. The writer's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor has a larger pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the writer's dog. The first time, the writer tries to pull the dog off. The second time, when the dog attacks again, the writer kicks the neighbor's dog to get it off. The neighbor apologizes but doesn't take action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again.\n\nSo, the key points here: the neighbor's dog is a danger because it's large and aggressive. The writer's actions were to protect their own dog. The neighbor isn't doing anything to control their dog. The first attack, the writer tried to stop it. The second time, the dog was on the writer's dog's neck, so the writer kicked it. Then the writer threatened to take action if it happened again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's think about legal and moral aspects. In terms of self-defense for pets, does the writer have the right to protect their own dog? In many places, you can take reasonable steps to protect your property or pets. Kicking the dog in the heat of the moment might be seen as a reasonable action to stop an immediate threat. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog is more problematic. That could be considered threatening or even illegal, depending on local laws. The writer also mentions threatening the neighbor about trespassing, which might be an issue if the neighbor's dog is on their property.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's dog is clearly a threat. The neighbor didn't take responsibility, just apologized. The writer's dog is in danger, so the writer feels justified. But threatening violence might be over the line. The writer could have called animal control immediately instead of threatening to kill the dog. Also, kicking the dog might be considered excessive force, but in the moment, when trying to save their own pet, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, is the writer at fault? The immediate actions to stop the attack might be justified, but the threats afterward might not be. The neighbor is also at fault for not controlling their dog. The writer's response to the neighbor's inaction is understandable but perhaps not the best approach. However, given the situation, the writer's primary concern is their dog's safety. The answer hinges on whether the writer's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. Since the dog was attacking their pet, using force to stop it could be seen as necessary. The threats might be the problematic part, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because protecting one's pet is a valid reason, and while the threats are bad, the immediate actions were defensive. The neighbor is more in the wrong for not controlling their dog. So the author isn't necessarily the asshole here.\n"
