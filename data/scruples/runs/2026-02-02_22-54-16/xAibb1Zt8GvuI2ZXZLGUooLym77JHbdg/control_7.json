They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice. The first time, the dog jumped the wall and went after their dog, which the author had to pull off. The next day, the dog did it again, even getting ahold of the small dog's neck. The author then kicked the dog twice to get it off, and after that, threatened the neighbor with either calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nSo the question is, is the author the asshole here? Let's break it down. Legally, in many places, you have the right to protect your property, which includes your pets. If a dog is attacking your pet, you may be justified in taking actions to stop the attack. Kicking the dog to defend your own pet could be seen as self-defense, but it's a bit of a gray area. Some might argue that using force is necessary, but others might say that there are less aggressive ways to handle it, like using a water spray or a barrier.\n\nThen there's the threat part. The author threatened to kill the dog or involve animal control if the attacks continued. Threats of violence can be problematic. While the intention is to protect their pet, threatening another person's property can cross a line. However, if the neighbor is negligent and the dog is a repeated danger, the threat might be seen as a last resort. The neighbor's response was just an apology without taking action to restrain their dog, which is concerning. If the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, the author might feel justified in escalating.\n\nEmotionally, the author was clearly shaken, which affects judgment. People under stress might react more intensely. The fact that this happened twice in a row could contribute to a heightened response. However, the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014might be seen as excessive by some. It's a balance between protecting one's own and using proportionate force.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's inaction is a factor. If they're not taking steps to secure their dog, they might be at fault. But the author's reaction to that inaction could still be seen as aggressive. The key here is whether the author's response was reasonable given the circumstances. Kicking the dog to prevent harm might be justified, but the threats could be problematic. It's possible that the author should have called animal control immediately instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn summary, the author may not be entirely in the wrong because protecting their pet is a valid concern. However, the threats could be seen as overstepping. It's a tricky situation where both parties might have contributed. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the immediate defense of their pet and the neighbor's negligence, the answer might be that the author is not the asshole. But the threats could tip the balance. Hmm.\n"
