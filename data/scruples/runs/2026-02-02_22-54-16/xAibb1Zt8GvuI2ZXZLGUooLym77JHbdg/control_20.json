They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two dogs: one from the neighbor, a bigger mix, and the author's smaller dog. The neighbor's dog jumped the wall twice and attacked the author's dog. The author responded by kicking the dog both times when it was attacking. Then, they threatened the neighbor to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you have a right to protect your property and pets. If a dog is attacking your pet, defending your animal might be justified. However, the method used here was kicking the dog. Kicking could be considered animal cruelty, depending on the force used. The author mentions doing it twice, first not hard, then harder. If the dog was in the act of attacking, self-defense for the pet might be a defense. But the author's response of threatening to kill the dog or call animal control is another point. Threatening someone's pet can be problematic, even if the dog is aggressive.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction was to apologize but not take action. That's a problem because they weren't addressing the root issue, allowing the dog to trespass and attack. The author is frustrated and scared for their small dog. However, the author's actions\u2014kicking the dog and making threats\u2014could be seen as excessive or violent. Even if justified by the circumstances, the method of response might be questionable. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, using force to protect your pet is allowed, but the level of force must be necessary. Kicking a dog repeatedly might not be necessary if the neighbor was present and could intervene. Also, threatening to kill someone else's animal is a serious threat and could lead to legal issues. The author might be justified in protecting their pet but the way they handled it could be seen as overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor didn't take steps to control their dog, which is their responsibility. The dog's owner is at fault for not keeping the dog on a leash or in a secure area. The author's frustration is understandable, but the threat of killing the dog could be crossing a line. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might not be in the wrong for protecting their dog but the specific actions (kicking and threatening to kill) might be problematic. However, in the heat of the moment and given the dog's aggression, some might argue it's a justified defense. But legally, threatening someone's property and using force could lead to charges. The neighbor's apathy is definitely an issue, but the author's response might be over the line. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for their actions, but the context complicates it. Wait, but the options are A for yes (author wrong) or B for no (author not wrong). Considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as in self-defense for their pet, but the threats and method of defense could be excessive. However, given the neighbor's neglect, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a tough call. The threat of killing the dog is a big red flag. That's probably the part where the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
