They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard and attacked their pet. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has a small dog, and the neighbor's large dog (a pitbull/German Shepherd mix) jumped over the wall twice and attacked their dog. The first time, they stopped the dog but it was very scary. The second time, the dog got a hold of their dog's neck. The author kicked the neighbor's dog to get it off, then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In many places, laws regarding defense of animals vary. Some jurisdictions might allow reasonable force to protect one's own pets from an imminent threat. However, threatening to kill someone's dog could be problematic. The act of kicking the dog might be considered excessive, especially if there were other options like using a stick or calling the owners immediately. The author's threat to \"kill\" the dog is a serious threat and could be seen as criminal, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a separate issue, but the question is about the author's actions. Even if the neighbor's dog was a threat, the author's response might cross a line. Threatening another person's pet can lead to legal consequences. Additionally, using force without warning or trying to involve authorities first could be an issue. The author might have been justified in protecting their own dog, but the methods and threats could be considered over the line.\n\nSo, there's a balance between protecting one's pet and using excessive force or making threats. The answer depends on local laws and the specific circumstances. But generally, threatening to kill someone's dog, even in self-defense of one's own pet, is likely to be seen as wrong. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the threats and possibly the force used.\n"
