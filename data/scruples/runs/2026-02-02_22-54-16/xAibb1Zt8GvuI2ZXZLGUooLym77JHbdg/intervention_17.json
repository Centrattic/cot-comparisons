They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their dog was attacked twice by their neighbor's dog. The author kicked the dog when it was attacking their small dog, and threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor didn't seem to take it seriously, just said sorry and didn't do anything to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, self-defense for pets. If someone's dog is attacking another dog, especially in a way that could be fatal, does the owner have the right to defend their pet? The author's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's is a larger breed. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, when it was attacking again, they kicked it. That seems like a reaction to protect their own dog. Legally, in many places, you can defend your property, which includes your pets. But did they cross a line? Kicking might be considered excessive, but if it was a matter of saving their dog's life, maybe not.\n\nThen there's the threat. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. Is that overstepping? Well, the neighbor didn't take action, so maybe the author felt they had to take some measures. However, making such a threat might not be the best approach. It could escalate tensions. But the neighbor's inaction is also a problem. They didn't leash the dog or keep it under control, which is their responsibility.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a key point here. If the owners aren't taking steps to prevent their dog from being a danger, they are at fault. The author is acting in self-defense and protecting their pet. The question is whether the author's actions (kicking the dog, making threats) are justified. Kicking might be a bit harsh, but in the moment of stress, it could be seen as necessary. The threats are more about deterrence. However, threats of violence might not be advisable, but given the situation, the author was likely in a panic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were trying to protect their dog from a larger, aggressive dog that the owners weren't controlling. The neighbor's negligence is the main issue. The author's actions, while maybe a bit aggressive, were in defense of their pet. The answer should be B (No).\n"
