They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a dog attack on their pet from a neighbor's dog. The author kicked the dog twice when it was attacking their smaller dog, and then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog again if it happened. They also threatened the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the immediate actions. The author's dog is in danger. The neighbor's dog is a larger breed that attacked. In the first incident, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, when the dog attacked again, the author kicked it twice. Now, in terms of self-defense, if you're protecting your property (in this case, your dog) from an immediate threat, using reasonable force might be justified. Kicking the dog to stop it from attacking\u2014maybe that's within the bounds of protecting your own pet. But the line gets blurry here. Kicking could be considered excessive, especially if it causes harm. But if the dog was actively attacking, maybe the force was necessary to save the smaller dog.\n\nThen there's the threat part. The author told the neighbor they'd call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and threatened to act against the neighbor if the dog trespassed. Threats of violence or harm to the neighbor's property (the dog) could be problematic. Even if the neighbor was negligent, threatening to kill their dog is a strong statement. Similarly, threatening to act against them if they trespass might be crossing into illegal territory, depending on local laws. Trespassing is a civil issue, but threatening violence over it could be a criminal matter.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's apathy is a point. They didn't take steps to control their dog, which is their responsibility. But the author's response escalated the situation with threats. While understandable given the stress, legal and ethical standards often require de-escalation and proper channels, like contacting authorities or involving animal control themselves instead of threatening to take matters into their own hands.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have the legal right to threaten harm to someone else's property, even if it's a dog. Animal cruelty laws vary, but using force to defend one's own pet is a defense in some cases. However, kicking a dog might be seen as animal cruelty if not done in immediate defense. Also, threatening to kill someone's dog without giving them a chance to address it (like putting it on a leash) might be seen as vigilantism.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is clear\u2014they should have controlled their dog. But the author's response, while understandable, might have crossed a line. The threats could be seen as disproportionate. The immediate action of kicking the dog might have been necessary to protect their pet, but the subsequent threats might not be justified. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for the threats, even if the initial defense was okay. The balance between protecting one's property and using excessive or threatening responses is key here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the threats and potentially excessive force, but there's a case to be made that protecting their pet justifies some actions. However, the threats of violence or illegal actions (like killing someone's dog) are more clearly wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
