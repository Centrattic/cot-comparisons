They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user's neighbor got a big dog, a pitbull/german shepherd mix. The user has a small dog that could be in danger. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumped the wall and attacked. The user tried to pull it off. The next day, the dog attacked again, this time getting a hold of the user's dog's neck. The user kicked the dog twice to make it let go, then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and also warned the neighbor about trespassing. Now the user is wondering if they were wrong to react that way.\n\nFirst, I should consider the laws regarding animal attacks. In many places, you can take reasonable action to protect your pets. Kicking the dog might be considered a reasonable defensive measure to prevent harm to the smaller dog. However, the threat to kill the dog could be an issue. Threats, even if made in anger or fear, might be legally problematic. Also, the user's response of threatening the neighbor might be seen as escalating the situation.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is mentioned. The neighbor didn't take steps to control the dog, so they might have some responsibility. But the user's actions to protect their pet could be justified. However, the method of response\u2014kicking and threatening\u2014might be seen as excessive by some standards.\n\nI should also think about the context. The user was acting in defense of their dog. If the neighbor's dog is a danger, the neighbor is responsible for preventing it. But the user's method of dealing with it might have been too harsh. There might be better ways to handle it, like contacting the neighbor first, then animal control, rather than threatening to kill the dog.\n\nSo, the user's actions were in self-defense for their pet, but the specific actions (kicking) and the threats might be questionable. Depending on the laws and the severity of the situation, the user might not be entirely in the wrong. But they could have handled it differently. However, in an emergency, people might act without thinking through every consequence. The question is whether their actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n"
