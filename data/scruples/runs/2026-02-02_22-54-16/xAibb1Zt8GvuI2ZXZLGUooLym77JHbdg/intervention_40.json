They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two dogs where one (Beef Boy) jumped the wall and attacked the writer's smaller dog. The writer initially tried to stop it, and when it happened again the next day, they kicked Beef Boy twice to get it off. The neighbor apologized but didn't take any action to prevent future incidents. The writer then threatened to call animal control or take more drastic measures if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, you can defend both people and animals from immediate harm. If your pet is in danger, taking reasonable action to protect it is justified. The writer's actions were in response to an attack on their dog, which is their property and a family member to many. Kicking the dog to stop the attack might be seen as a defense measure. However, the force used could be a point of contention. Was the force necessary and proportionate? If the dog was actively attacking and the writer had no other way to stop it, kicking might be acceptable. But if there were other options, like using a weapon or calling for help, that could affect the judgment.\n\nThe neighbor's role is also important. They had a dog that repeatedly breached the wall and attacked. Their apologies without taking corrective actions (like keeping the dog on a leash, training, or fixing the wall) show negligence. The writer's threats of calling animal control or more severe actions could be justified given the neighbor's inaction and the continued threat to their pet.\n\nHowever, threatening to kill someone else's dog is a serious action. Legally, if the dog is on the neighbor's property and there's no immediate threat, threatening harm could lead to charges. The writer's intent to protect their dog is understandable, but the method of response might be seen as excessive if they didn't first exhaust all legal channels, like contacting animal control themselves or discussing with the neighbor through proper means before taking matters into their own hands.\n\nEthically, the writer acted out of fear and to protect their pet, which is a strong motivator. But the response of threatening to kill the dog might be seen as crossing a line, even if the neighbor was negligent. The key here is whether the writer's actions were proportionate and legally permissible under the circumstances. If the dog's owner had taken no steps to secure their pet, the writer might have a case for self-defense of their property. But the method of response could still be questionable.\n\nIn summary, the writer's immediate actions to stop the attack could be justified, but the subsequent threats might be seen as overreaching. The neighbor's negligence also plays a role, but the writer's responsibility to handle the situation within legal bounds is important. The answer might hinge on local laws regarding self-defense for animals and the acceptable methods of intervention.\n"
