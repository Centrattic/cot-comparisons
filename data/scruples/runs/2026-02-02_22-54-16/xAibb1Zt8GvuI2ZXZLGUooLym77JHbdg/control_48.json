They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation involves their neighbor's large dog attacking their small dog twice. The first time, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and the author pulls it off. The second time, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks it to get it off their dog. They threatened the neighbor with animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author overstepped. The key points here are self-defense for their pet, the neighbor's responsibility, and the actions taken. In many places, you can defend your property and pets if they're in immediate danger. Kicking a dog to protect your own might be justified in a split-second reaction to prevent harm. However, threatening to kill the dog could be problematic. While the neighbor's negligence (not keeping their dog contained) is an issue, the author's response might have crossed a line. Threats of violence or harm to property can be legally and ethically questionable, even if motivated by protecting their pet.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If they didn't take steps to secure their dog after the first incident, they bear some responsibility. But the author's reaction\u2014threatening to kill the dog or call animal control\u2014might be excessive. While understandable, it's important to consider legal repercussions and proper channels. Instead of threatening to harm the dog, they might have been advised to take legal actions like contacting authorities or seeking a restraining order if necessary. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the justification for their actions. Protecting a pet from an imminent threat could be seen as reasonable, but the method (kicking) and threats might not be. However, in emergencies, people might act without thinking perfectly. The neighbor's failure to address the issue is also a factor. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals. Kicking once or twice might be acceptable, but it's a gray area. The threats to kill the dog, though, are more concerning. While the neighbor's negligence is a problem, the author's response could be seen as overreacting. However, considering the immediate danger, some might argue it's justified. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because they acted to protect their pet from a direct threat. However, the threats might still be questionable. But given the context, it's a close call. The neighbor's inaction is a big part of the problem. So, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
