They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their own dog twice, and the author's response to that.\n\nFirst, the context: The author lives next to a new family who got a large dog, a pitbull/german shepherd mix. The author's dog is a small mix and they were worried about the bigger dog. The first incident: the dog jumps the wall and attacks, the author pulls it off. The next day, the dog attacks again, and the author kicks it twice to make it let go. The neighbor just says sorry but doesn't take action. The author then threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again, and also mentions something about trespassing.\n\nSo, the main points here are the dog's aggression, the neighbor's lack of action, and the author's response. The author is asking if they're the asshole for threatening the dog and the neighbor.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. In many places, laws protect people from protecting their property (including pets) from threats. If a dog is attacking, using force to defend your own dog could be considered reasonable. Kicking the dog once or twice to save their own pet might be acceptable under self-defense for the animal. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might be seen as overstepping, depending on circumstances. Also, the neighbor's inaction is a factor. If the neighbor isn't controlling their dog properly, they might be at fault. But the author's threats could be seen as aggressive. However, given the immediate danger to their pet, maybe it's within their rights to act protectively. There's also the aspect of trespassing if the dog entered the author's yard. The neighbor's dog being off-leash and not controlled might be the root issue. The author's response could be justified as necessary to protect their pet, especially if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility. But threatening to kill the dog might be a problem unless it's imminent and necessary. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their pet from a dangerous situation, but their threats might be seen as harsh. However, the neighbor's negligence is a big part here. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they were protecting their dog, but maybe there's a nuance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the dog's aggression, the neighbor's lack of control, and the author's defensive actions. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their pet, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's failure to control the dog is a bigger issue. So the answer is B.\n"
