They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and they ended up kicking the neighbor's dog both times to protect theirs. They also threatened the neighbor with calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer's dog is a small mix, and the neighbor's dog is a larger pitbull/German Shepard mix. The first incident, the neighbor's dog jumps the wall and attacks, the writer pulls it off. The next day, the dog attacks again, this time with its mouth around the small dog's neck. The writer kicks the dog to stop it, and then threatens the neighbor.\n\nNow, the key points are self-defense of their pet. In many places, protecting your property or animals from immediate harm can be justified. However, using force might be a gray area. Kicking the dog could be considered excessive, depending on the circumstances. But since the dog was attacking, causing potential harm to the small dog, the writer's actions might be seen as a necessary defense.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. The neighbor didn't take action after the first incident, which could be seen as negligence. The writer's threat to call animal control or kill the dog might be a strong response, but given the situation, it's understandable they were scared for their pet.\n\nHowever, threatening to kill someone's dog might be crossing a line legally, depending on local laws. Some places might require a warning before taking action against an animal. Also, using force like kicking could potentially be considered animal cruelty if the neighbor's dog was injured, even in self-defense.\n\nBut considering the immediate threat to their own dog, which is a living being and a pet, the writer's actions might be justified. The neighbor's failure to control their dog is also a problem. The writer's response could be seen as a last resort to protect their pet from repeated attacks.\n\nSo, weighing the immediate danger to their dog versus the actions taken, the writer might not be in the wrong. The neighbor is partly responsible for not controlling their dog. The writer's threats were likely meant to prevent future incidents. However, the method of response (kicking and threatening) could be seen as harsh, but in the heat of the moment, it's a protective reaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some legal considerations, the writer's intent was to protect their pet, and the neighbor's negligence plays a role. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
