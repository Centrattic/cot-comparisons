They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves two dogs, one from the neighbor which attacked the author's dog twice. The author ended up kicking the neighbor's dog to get it off, then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent future incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws around self-defense for pets. In many places, you have a duty to protect your own property and animals. If an animal is attacking yours, certain defensive actions might be justified. However, using force like kicking could be problematic if it's excessive. Also, threatening to kill someone else's dog might cross a line, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nThe neighbor's dog kept trespassing and attacking. The owner's response was just an apology without taking steps to prevent it again. That seems negligent. The author's actions were in response to an immediate threat to their pet. Kicking the dog to stop the attack might be seen as necessary, but the threat to kill or call animal control could be seen as aggressive.\n\nBut there's a balance. The author might have overstepped by making threats beyond just defending their dog. They could have called the police or animal control after the first incident instead of handling it themselves. However, given the immediate danger to their small dog, some might argue that the threat was justified to prevent future harm.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's inaction is a factor. If they didn't secure their dog properly, they might be at fault. But the author's response included threats, which could be seen as escalating the situation. So, while the initial attack was the neighbor's responsibility, the author's response might be considered over the line, especially the threat to kill the dog. However, depending on local laws, some actions might be justified.\n\nIn terms of community norms, people often expect owners to protect their pets, but threatening violence or making threats to kill could be seen as the wrong approach. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer here, but their reaction could be seen as excessive. Still, considering the danger to their pet, others might empathize with their anger and fear.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. But in many cases, threatening another person's property with violence could be considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. The author's actions might be seen as justified in protecting their dog in the moment, but the subsequent threats might place them in the wrong. However, if the neighbor was negligent, some might argue both parties have issues. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Depending on the perspective, the answer could be either, but legally, threats to destroy property (the dog) might be problematic. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for making threats, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to self-defense.\n"
