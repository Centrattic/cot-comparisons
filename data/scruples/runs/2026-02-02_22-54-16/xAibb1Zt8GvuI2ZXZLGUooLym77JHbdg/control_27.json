They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The main event is that the neighbor's large dog jumped the wall twice and attacked their small dog. The author kicked the dog the second time to save their own pet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a mix of pitbull and German shepherd, which are often seen as powerful breeds. The author has a small dog that couldn't defend itself. The first incident involved the neighbor's dog jumping the wall and attacking, and the neighbor didn't take action to prevent it. The second time, the dog again attacked, and the author kicked it to save their own. The neighbor responded apologetically but didn't take any measures to prevent future incidents.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense and property rights. When defending one's pets, there's a line between necessary force and excessive. The author used physical force (kicking) to stop the attack, which could be seen as justified to protect their animal. However, threatening to kill the neighbor's dog or call animal control might be seen as a threat, which can be problematic legally and socially. Also, the neighbor might have a responsibility to control their pet, especially if it's a known aggressive breed.\n\nBut the neighbor's inaction is also a factor. If they didn't secure their dog properly, maybe they are at fault. The author's reaction could be considered reasonable given the immediate threat. However, the author's threats might escalate the situation beyond what's necessary. Legally, using force to protect property or animals can vary by jurisdiction, but if the dog was unprovoked and the action was to prevent harm, it might be defensible.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Kicking a dog in the heat of the moment to save their own could be seen as a split-second decision to prevent injury, which might be excusable. However, the subsequent threats to kill the dog or harm the neighbor could be problematic. The neighbor's apathy is also a point against them, but the author's response needs to be proportionate.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for defending their pet, but the threats might make them the asshole. However, given the neighbor's failure to control their dog, the author's actions could be seen as justified to some extent. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the immediate action to save the pet was necessary, even if the threats were excessive.\n"
