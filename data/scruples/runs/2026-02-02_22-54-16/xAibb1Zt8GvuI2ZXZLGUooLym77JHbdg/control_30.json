They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their neighbor's dog attacking their smaller dog twice. First, the author's dog was chased by the neighbor's pitbull mix, which jumped the wall. Then the next day, the neighbor's dog actually got ahold of the author's dog, so they kicked the dog to make it let go. The author threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and told the neighbor to keep their dog under control.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's break it down. When the neighbor's dog attacked the first time, the author tried to stop it. The second time, when the dog was holding their dog's neck, they kicked it. That seems like a reasonable self-defense action to protect their own pet. Kicking in that moment might have been necessary to save their dog's life. But maybe there's a more appropriate way to handle it, like using a tool instead of kicking, but given the urgency, kicking might have been the only option.\n\nThen there's the threatening part. The author told the neighbor that if the dog attacked again, they'd call animal control or kill it. Threatening someone's pet can be a red flag because it's a living being, and while the anger is understandable, making such a threat could be seen as excessive. However, the neighbor wasn't doing anything to prevent the attacks, so the author feels justified in protecting their own dog.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility here is also a factor. They got a large dog that's a mix of breeds that can be aggressive, and they didn't take proper precautions like keeping it on a leash or in a secured area. The fact that they just said \"sorry\" without taking any action shows negligence on their part. So the neighbor is at least partially at fault for not controlling their dog.\n\nNow, the author's reaction\u2014kicking the dog to save their own pet\u2014might be seen as a necessary action in the moment. But threatening to kill the dog could be considered over the line. However, given the situation where the neighbor isn't taking responsibility, the author's frustration is valid. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate. Kicking the dog was a physical defense, which might be necessary if the dog was in the act of attacking. But the threats afterward might be more questionable, even if the neighbor's apathy is inexcusable.\n\nIn legal terms, if someone's animal is attacking another, the owner of the attacked animal might have the right to defend their pet, but the methods used can be scrutinized. Kicking the attacking dog could be justified as self-defense for the pet. However, making threats of violence towards the neighbor's property (the dog) could lead to legal issues for the author, even if the neighbor is negligent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong for the physical action of kicking the dog to stop it, but the threats afterward might put them in a tricky legal and ethical position. However, the neighbor's negligence is definitely a big part of the problem. The answer might depend on local laws regarding animal control and self-defense. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is their threats. However, the neighbor's inaction also plays a role. Given that, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author was protecting their pet and the neighbor was negligent. But the threats could make them the asshole. Hmm, tricky. I think the main wrongdoer here is the neighbor for not controlling their dog, so the author's actions are a response to that negligence. But the threat to kill might be an overreaction. Still, given the context, maybe the answer is B.\n"
