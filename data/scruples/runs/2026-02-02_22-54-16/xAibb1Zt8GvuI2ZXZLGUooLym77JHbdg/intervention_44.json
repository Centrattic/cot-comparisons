They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong after hurting a dog that jumped into their backyard. The situation is pretty intense. So, first, the neighbor has a large dog that jumped over the wall twice, attacking their smaller dog. The first time, the author tried to pull the dog off, but the neighbor just took their dog back. The second time, the dog got a hold of the author's dog's neck, and the author kicked it to get it off. The neighbor then just said sorry but didn't take any action.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The neighbor is responsible for their dog's safety and behavior. If the dog is a known aggressive breed or has a tendency to jump fences, the owner should have taken precautions like keeping it on a leash or in a secure area. The fact that the dog was able to jump the wall twice suggests that the neighbor didn't have proper containment, which is their responsibility.\n\nThe author's actions were in defense of their own dog. When the dog was attacking their pet and putting it in immediate danger, using force (like kicking) to separate them could be seen as a reasonable reaction to prevent harm. However, the line between self-defense and excessive force can be blurry. Kicking the dog might be considered aggressive, especially if it could cause injury. But given the circumstances\u2014trying to save their dog's life\u2014it might be justified.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is also a factor. If the owner is not taking steps to control their dog after repeated incidents, that's a problem. The author's threat to call animal control or take more drastic measures if the dog attacks again is a warning that the neighbor needs to address the issue. The author's response might have been strong, but it's in response to a real danger and the neighbor's lack of action.\n\nLegally, the situation might depend on local laws. In some places, if an animal is a threat to another animal or person, the owner can take reasonable steps to protect their property. However, causing harm to another person's animal could lead to legal issues. The author might have overstepped, but their intent was to protect their dog, which is a mitigating factor.\n\nEmotionally, the author was shaken up, which is understandable. The neighbor's dismissive attitude could have contributed to the author's heightened response. However, threatening to kill the dog or take other drastic actions might be seen as excessive, even if justified by the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is at fault for not controlling their dog, the author's actions might be seen as justified in the moment to protect their pet. However, the threat to harm the dog in the future could be problematic. The author is probably not in the wrong for reacting to an immediate threat, but the follow-up threats might be an issue. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but with some caveats depending on local laws and the specifics of the actions taken.\n"
