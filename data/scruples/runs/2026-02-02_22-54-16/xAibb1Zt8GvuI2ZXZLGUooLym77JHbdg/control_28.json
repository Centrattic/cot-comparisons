They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog attack on their neighbor's dog. The author kicked the dog twice when it was attacking their own small dog. The neighbor didn't seem to take any action beyond apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding self-defense for pets. In many places, you can defend your property, including pets, but the level of force must be reasonable. Kicking a dog that's attacking your pet might be considered excessive, but it's a split-second reaction. The author's dog is small and could be seriously hurt, so maybe they felt it was necessary. However, threatening to kill the dog or call animal control might cross a line. Threats can be illegal, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nThe neighbor's inattentiveness is also a factor. If the dog is a known aggressive breed and they didn't control it properly, they might have a responsibility. The author's actions were in response to an immediate threat to their pet. On the other hand, using physical force against another person's animal could be seen as assault. The neighbor apologizing but not taking action might be part of the problem.\n\nI need to check if the author's response was proportional. Kicking to stop the attack might be justified, but the follow-up threats could be problematic. The question is whether the author overstepped by threatening lethal force. Also, trespassing by the dog could be an issue, but the author's response to that isn't the main point here.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't use deadly force against animals unless they are a direct threat to human life. Since it was a pet, maybe the force wasn't justified beyond a certain point. The author might be in the right in defending their dog but crossing into the neighbor's property to do so could be an issue. Also, the threats after the incident might be the part where they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, balancing the immediate threat to their pet versus the methods used. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for defending their dog but the threats could be problematic. However, depending on local laws, the kicking might still be considered excessive. But given the scenario, the author's actions were in response to an attack, so maybe they're not the asshole. The neighbor's negligence is also a factor. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
