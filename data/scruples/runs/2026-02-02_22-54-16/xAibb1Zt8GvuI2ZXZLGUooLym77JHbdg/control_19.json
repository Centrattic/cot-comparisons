They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their small dog twice, and the author responding by kicking the dog when it attacked again. They also threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is a large mix that jumped over the wall twice, attacking the small dog. The author tried to intervene both times, but with the second attack, they resorted to kicking the dog. The neighbor apologized but didn't take action to prevent future incidents. The author then made threats if the dog attacked again.\n\nNow, thinking about the legality and ethics. In many places, animal control laws protect pets, but you can't necessarily harm another person's animal without consequence. However, self-defense for your own pet might be a gray area. Kicking the dog to protect your own could be seen as necessary, but threats of violence or killing might not be justified, even if the neighbor's dog is a threat.\n\nThe neighbor's lack of action is a problem, but that doesn't give the author the right to threaten harm. There might be legal repercussions for threatening another's property. Also, the method of response (kicking the dog) might be excessive, depending on the situation. The author's actions might be understandable given the fear of their small dog being harmed, but threatening to kill the dog or call animal control could be seen as overreacting, even if they felt justified.\n\nSo, weighing the options: the author acted to protect their pet, which is understandable, but their threats might cross into being in the wrong. The correct answer here might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the threats made, but some might argue B (No) due to the neighbor's negligence. However, the specific action of threatening to kill the dog could be the key point here.\n"
