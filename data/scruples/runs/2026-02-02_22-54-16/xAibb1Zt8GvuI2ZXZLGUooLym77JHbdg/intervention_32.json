They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting a neighbor's dog that jumped over the wall and attacked their own dog. The situation seems pretty tense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a small dog, and the neighbor has a large one. The neighbor's dog jumped over the wall twice, attacking the author's dog. On the second incident, the author kicked the neighbor's dog to get it off. The neighbor apologized but didn't take further action. The author then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned about trespassing.\n\nNow, considering self-defense for pets. In many places, you have a duty to protect your property and animals from immediate harm. If the neighbor's dog was unprovoked and a threat to the author's dog, using reasonable force to defend could be justified. Kicking the dog once to get it off might be considered reasonable, but doing it harder if the first kick didn't work might be a bit more aggressive. However, it was in response to an attack on their own pet, so maybe it's excusable.\n\nThe threats made by the author\u2014threatening to kill the dog or call animal control\u2014could be a problem. Depending on the jurisdiction, threatening someone's animal might be seen as a crime, even if the initial reason is justified. Also, trespassing by the neighbor could be an issue. The author might be within their rights to address trespassing, but the manner of the threats could be problematic.\n\nThe neighbor's responsibility is also in question. They had a large dog that was not properly contained, leading to attacks. Their apology without taking action (like keeping the dog leashed or muzzled) shows negligence. The author had to take matters into their own hands because the neighbor wasn't preventing the attacks.\n\nHowever, the author's response might be seen as escalating the situation. Instead of immediately threatening lethal force, maybe calling animal control or involving local authorities first would be a better approach. The author's actions could be seen as self-defense up to a point, but the threats might cross a line.\n\nIn some areas, the law allows for defending your animals from immediate danger, but the method of defense must be reasonable. Kicking the dog might be acceptable in the moment, but threatening to kill unless the neighbor complies could be illegal. The author might be justified in protecting their pet but could be overstepping in the threats made afterward.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in a tough spot. They were protecting their dog, which is understandable, but the threats might be where they go wrong. The answer might hinge on the specific laws regarding animal defense and threats, but generally, the initial action to stop the attack could be justified, while the threats might not be. However, the neighbor's negligence also plays a role here. \n\nGiven that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for protecting their dog but could be in the wrong for the threats. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since the main action was defending their dog and the threats were a reaction to negligence, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. However, in many cases, self-defense of pets is allowed, and the threats might be a separate issue. If the user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA), the community often considers intent and provocation. Here, the neighbor's dog was a repeated threat, so the author's actions might be seen as justified. The final answer is likely B.\n"
