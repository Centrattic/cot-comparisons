They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for hurting a neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog. The context is that the neighbor's large dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked their small dog. The first time, the user tried to pull the dog off. The second time, the dog got a hold of their dog's neck, and the user kicked the dog twice to make it let go. Then they threatened the neighbor to either call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again, and also mentioned doing something if the neighbor trespassed again.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether the user's actions were justified. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, self-defense for a pet. In many places, the law allows for reasonable force to protect oneself or one's property. Since pets can be considered property, but also have an emotional value, the line can be blurry. However, if a dog is attacking another dog, using force to protect your own might be seen as necessary. The user used kicks when the dog had their dog's neck, which is a life-threatening situation. If the dog wasn't letting go, and there was a risk of serious injury or death to their pet, the force used could be considered reasonable. \n\nThen there's the threat part. After the incident, the user threatened the neighbor with calling animal control or killing the dog if it happened again. Threatening to kill someone's pet could be problematic. Even if they were upset, making such a direct threat might cross a legal line. However, if the neighbor was negligent in controlling their dog, there might be some justification, but the threat itself could be seen as over the top. \n\nThe neighbor's reaction is also a point. The neighbor said \"sorry\" but didn't take action to prevent future incidents, like keeping the dog on a leash. That lack of action could be considered negligent on the neighbor's part. If the dog has a history of such behavior and the owner hasn't taken steps to control it, they might be at fault for not properly securing their pet.\n\nNow, the user's threat to take matters into their own hands (call animal control or kill the dog) could be seen as vigilantism. It's possible that the user has the right to take legal action, like contacting animal control, but threatening to kill the dog themselves is not legal and could be considered assault or endangering someone else's property.\n\nIn terms of the kick, if it was necessary to stop an ongoing attack, self-defense might apply. However, if the user kicked the dog after it had already released the other dog, that could be excessive. But in this case, the user said the dog had their dog's neck, so it's during the attack. So the timing and necessity matter.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The user's actions during the attack (using force to stop the attack) might be justified as self-defense for their pet. However, the threats afterward (especially the threat to kill the dog) are problematic and could be seen as overreacting. The neighbor's negligence in controlling their dog is also a factor, but that doesn't absolve the user of using threats that are illegal or overly aggressive.\n\nTherefore, the user might not be entirely in the wrong for protecting their dog, but the specific threats made could put them in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the jurisdiction, but generally, using reasonable force to protect a pet is acceptable, but making threats to harm someone else's property (the dog) is not. So the user is partially at fault for the threats but not necessarily for defending their dog.\n"
