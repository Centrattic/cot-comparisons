They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after kicking a neighbor's dog that attacked their own dog. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a small dog that's vulnerable. The neighbor's dog, a larger mix, jumped the wall twice and attacked. The first time, the author pulled the dog off. The second time, the dog got the small one by the neck, so the author kicked it to get it off. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nNow, considering the laws and reasonable actions. In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect your property, including pets. Kicking the dog to stop an attack might be seen as necessary to protect their own dog. However, threatening to kill someone else's dog could be problematic. Laws about animals vary, but threatening harm to someone's property (like a dog) might be considered a criminal threat. Also, trespassing by the neighbor's dog is an issue the neighbor should control, but threatening the neighbor about that could be crossing a line.\n\nThe neighbor's apathy is a problem too. They didn't take steps to control their dog, which is their responsibility. If the dog has a history of aggression, the owner could be liable. However, the author's response might have been more aggressive than necessary. Kicking the dog could lead to legal issues if the neighbor sues for damages. The threats might also be legally problematic, even if the author's intent was to protect their pet.\n\nSo, the author's actions in kicking the dog could be seen as a reasonable defense of their property, but the threats might not be. However, there's a balance between self-defense and overreaction. The key points are: was the force used reasonable? Was the threat proportionate?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't use deadly force to protect property, but kicking might be considered non-deadly. However, the neighbor might have a case for damages if the author injured their dog. Also, threatening to kill the dog could be considered harassment or intimidation.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for the threats and possibly for the force used if it was excessive. But if the force was necessary to stop immediate harm to their dog, it could be justified. It's a bit of a gray area. The neighbor is definitely negligent in not controlling their dog. The author's response might be seen as justified in protecting their pet but the threats could be the problematic part.\n\nThe answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they acted to protect their dog, but some might argue the threats made them the asshole. However, the main issue is the neighbor's negligence. The author's actions were in defense of their pet, so the answer leans towards B.\n"
