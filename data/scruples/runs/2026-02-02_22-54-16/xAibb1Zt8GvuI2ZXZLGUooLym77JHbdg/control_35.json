They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe user has a small dog and their neighbor got a big pitbull/German Shepherd mix. The big dog jumped over the wall twice and attacked the small dog. The first time, the user pulled the dog off, and the neighbor took it back. The next day, the big dog attacked again, got hold of the small dog's neck, and the user kicked it twice to make it let go. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent it. The user then threatened to call animal control or kill the dog if it happened again and warned the neighbor about trespassing.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The neighbor's dog is a large breed and jumped over the wall twice, attacking the small dog. The user is trying to protect their pet. In the second incident, the dog had the user's dog by the neck, which could have been fatal. The user kicked the dog to save their pet. Kicking might be a bit forceful, but in a life-threatening situation for the small dog, using force might be justified.\n\nThe neighbor's response was just an apology without any real action, like keeping the dog on a leash or training it. The user then threatened to take further action if it happened again. The key here is self-defense of their pet. In many jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect your property or animals from harm. However, threatening to kill the dog might be a problem, as that's more than just preventing immediate harm. But considering the dog's prior behavior, maybe it's a reasonable threat to prevent future attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did kick the dog. Depending on the situation, kicking could be seen as excessive. But the alternative was letting the dog potentially kill their small dog, which is a serious risk. Also, the neighbor's inaction suggests that they're not responsible enough to control their dog, so the user might feel justified in taking matters into their own hands.\n\nBut the user's threat to kill the dog if it happens again might be a legal issue. However, if the dog is a known threat, some places allow taking action to prevent it from attacking again, especially if the owner isn't responsible. The user also mentioned calling animal control, which is a valid step.\n\nThe main points are: protecting one's own animal from imminent danger, the neighbor's failure to control their dog, and the user's response. The user's actions were in defense of their pet, which is a valid reason. The threats might be a bit strong, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. So the user is probably not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
