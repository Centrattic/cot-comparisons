They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two neighbors with dogs. The author has a small dog and the neighbor has a bigger pitbull/german shepherd mix. The neighbor's dog jumps the wall twice and attacks the author's dog. The author kicks the dog to save their own and threatens to call animal control or kill the dog if it happens again. The neighbor is apologetic but doesn't take action.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not, but wants an opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is protecting their dog. The neighbor's dog attacked unprovoked, which is dangerous. The author used force to stop the attack, which is reasonable in self-defense or to protect property. Kicking the dog might be excessive, but the immediate threat was to their own dog, which could have been seriously injured or killed. The threats made by the author\u2014calling animal control or \"killing\" the dog\u2014if the neighbor doesn't take action\u2014might be seen as aggressive, but given the repeated attacks, the author might feel justified.\n\nThe neighbor's response is just an apology without any action to prevent future incidents. That's concerning because they're not addressing the root problem. The author's actions are in response to the neighbor's inaction. Legally, if a dog attacks another, the owner is responsible. The author might have a right to protect their pet, but the method of defense (kicking) could be a point of contention. However, in the heat of the moment, using force to stop an attack is understandable. \n\nThe threats made by the author could be seen as over the line, but given the circumstances, they might feel it's necessary to ensure the neighbor takes responsibility. The answer depends on cultural and legal norms. In many places, you have the right to defend your property and pets, but the method and threats can vary. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions are a reaction to a serious threat to their pet. While the kicking might be aggressive, it's in defense. The threats are a strong response but might be justified if the neighbor isn't taking responsibility. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
