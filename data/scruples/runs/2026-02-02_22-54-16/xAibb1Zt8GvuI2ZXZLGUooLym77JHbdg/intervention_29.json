They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves their neighbor's dog attacking their own dog twice. They kicked the dog when it was attacking their pet. The question is whether that action was justified or if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbor's dog is described as a large pitbull/german shepard mix, which is a powerful breed. The writer has a small dog, which is more vulnerable. The neighbor didn't seem to take action after the first attack, just said sorry the second time. \n\nThe writer kicked the dog to stop it from attacking their own. The first time, they pulled the dog off, but the second time, the dog was on their dog's neck, so they kicked it. The key here is the immediate threat to their pet. In many places, the law allows for using reasonable force to protect property or animals. However, the question is whether kicking the dog was excessive. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's apathy is a factor. The neighbor didn't take steps to prevent the attacks, like leashing the dog or training it. The writer felt they had to act because the neighbor wasn't responsible. The threats made by the writer (calling animal control or killing the dog) might be on the extreme side, but the immediate action to protect their pet might be justified.\n\nAnother point is that the dog jumped the wall. If the dog was on the writer's property without permission, that's trespassing. Using force to remove the dog could be considered self-defense for their property and pets. However, using physical violence (kicking) might be seen as aggressive if the dog wasn't in a life-or-death situation. But in this case, the dog was attacking their own, which is a serious threat.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal standards here. Generally, you can protect your property with reasonable force. Kicking might be a form of reasonable force if immediate to stop harm. But if there were alternative ways (like using a stick or barrier), that might be different. The writer acted in the moment to save their dog.\n\nThe neighbor's response was also passive. The writer's threats might be strong, but given the neighbor's inaction, they might feel justified. The main issue is whether the writer's actions were proportionate. Kicking to stop an attack could be acceptable, but threatening to kill the dog might be crossing a line. However, the post is asking if the writer is in the wrong for hurting the dog. The answer depends on whether the force was reasonable. \n\nIn many cases, self-defense for pets is a gray area, but protecting one's own property and animals is generally allowed. So the writer might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
