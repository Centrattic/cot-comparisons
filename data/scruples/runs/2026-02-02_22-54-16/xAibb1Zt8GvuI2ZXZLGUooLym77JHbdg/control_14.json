They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their neighbor's dog attacking their smaller dog twice, and the person kicking the dog to save it. Then they threatened to call animal control or kill it if it happened again. The neighbor just said sorry but didn't take action to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and norms around self-defense for pets. In many places, people have the right to protect their property and animals from harm. But the line is blurry when it comes to responding with force. Kicking a dog to stop it from attacking another animal could be seen as reasonable if it's an immediate threat, but using excessive force might not be justified. However, in a split-second situation, people often act instinctively.\n\nThe author's actions were reactive. They had a small dog that's vulnerable. The neighbor's dog jumped the fence twice, which could be due to poor training or restraint. The neighbor's response was apologetic but didn't address the root problem. The author threatened the neighbor about future actions, which might be seen as aggressive, but given the lack of action from the neighbor, it could be seen as a justified last resort to ensure their pet's safety.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are whether the author's response was proportionate and necessary. Kicking the dog to prevent an attack on their own dog might be considered defensive. But threatening to kill the dog could be crossing a line, though it's a threat in a moment of stress. The neighbor's inaction is also a factor\u2014maybe they should have taken responsibility for their dog's behavior, which is a failure on their part.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they did try to protect their pet, which is their right. The threats might be impulsive, but not necessarily wrong given the neighbor's lack of action. So the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that they should have found another solution first. But in the heat of the moment, especially after two incidents, the reaction is more understandable. The neighbor is likely at fault for not controlling their dog. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
