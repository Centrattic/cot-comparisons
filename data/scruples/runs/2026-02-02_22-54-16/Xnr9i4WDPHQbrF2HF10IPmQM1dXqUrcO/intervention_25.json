I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the author is refusing to have anal sex, and the boyfriend keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the post says. The author told her boyfriend from the start that anal sex was a no-go, and she had a bad experience with someone else where it hurt and he didn't stop. Now the boyfriend is persistently asking, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and even calling her names like \"asshole.\" The author is considering breaking up because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries in relationships, a key point is that if someone clearly states a boundary, the other person should respect it. The boyfriend is not respecting her stated limit, which is a red flag. Even though he might have different interests or kinks, forcing someone beyond their comfort zone is not acceptable. The fact that she's trying to compromise but he's not listening suggests that he's not being considerate of her feelings and history. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior of pressuring and dismissing her reasons (like saying she's a prude) shows a lack of respect. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. Since the author is standing by her boundaries and the issue is the other person's refusal to accept them, the blame isn't on the author. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is violating her boundaries, which is the issue here.\n"
