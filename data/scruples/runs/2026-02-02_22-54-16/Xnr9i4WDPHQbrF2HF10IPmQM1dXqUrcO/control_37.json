I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to engage in anal sex, but the author has a firm boundary against it due to past experiences and current preferences. The boyfriend is pressuring them, using various arguments and even calling them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The user clearly stated their no to anal sex from the start, but the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's persistence despite being told it's a hard no could indicate a lack of respect for their consent. \n\nThe author mentions a past traumatic experience with anal sex where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. This history is crucial because it shows the author has valid reasons rooted in safety and comfort. The current boyfriend isn't acknowledging this history, which could be a red flag for not taking their boundaries seriously.\n\nThe boyfriend's arguments about using more lube or that it won't hurt ignore the author's stated feelings and past experiences. Pressuring someone to change their mind when they've firmly said no can be a form of manipulation. The fact that he calls the author a prude and an asshole further indicates disrespect and possible emotional manipulation.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, when one partner repeatedly disregards the other's boundaries despite clear communication, it's a significant issue. The author's consideration of ending the relationship suggests they feel their needs aren't being met, which is a valid response if the partner isn't willing to respect their limits.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author is being unreasonable. The story says they're \"vanilla\" and the boyfriend is \"kinky,\" but the key point is that the author has communicated their boundaries, and the issue is the boyfriend not respecting them. The author isn't in the wrong for having boundaries; the problem is the boyfriend's lack of respect for those boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
