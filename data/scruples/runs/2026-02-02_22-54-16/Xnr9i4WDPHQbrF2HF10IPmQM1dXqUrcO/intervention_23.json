I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author and their boyfriend disagreeing on anal sex. The author clearly set a boundary from the start, explaining they don't want to engage in anal sex. The boyfriend, however, keeps pushing, using various tactics like offering compromises and even calling the author names. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what healthy relationship dynamics look like. Consent is key here. The author has communicated their boundaries clearly. The boyfriend not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure them is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. If one partner continues to push despite clear refusal, that's a sign of disrespect.\n\nAlso, the author mentions a past negative experience with anal sex where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. That adds context to their current refusal. The current boyfriend's insistence might be triggering or causing distress, which is not acceptable. The boyfriend's use of guilt-tripping (\"you've never tried it with me\") and dismissive comments (\"call her an asshole\") are manipulative and disrespectful.\n\nCompromise is important, but only within the boundaries both parties are comfortable with. The boyfriend isn't compromising; he's demanding the author change their stance. The author has tried compromising but the boyfriend isn't willing to accept their limits. This one-way compromise is problematic.\n\nIn terms of consent, it's about enthusiastic agreement, not just absence of a \"no.\" Once a \"no\" is given, pressing further invalidates the consent process. The boyfriend's behavior is coercive, which is a form of abuse. Healthy relationships don't involve coercion or manipulation to get one's way, especially regarding sexual activities.\n\nThe author being \"prudish\" isn't the issue. Everyone has different comfort levels, and it's about mutual respect. The boyfriend's reaction, calling the author names and questioning their openness, shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and personal history.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The correct answer should be B.\n"
