I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex with a boyfriend.\n\nThe author says they don't want to do anal sex. They told their boyfriend upfront, and he's been pressuring them despite that. The boyfriend is being pushy, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. The author is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to have anal sex. From what I know, consent and respecting boundaries are key. If the author clearly set a boundary and the boyfriend is pressuring, that's his issue. The author isn't obligated to comply if it's a hard no. The boyfriend's behavior sounds disrespectful. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
