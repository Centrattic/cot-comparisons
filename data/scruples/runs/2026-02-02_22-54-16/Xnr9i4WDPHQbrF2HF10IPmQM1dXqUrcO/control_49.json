I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's very vanilla and has a firm no to anal sex. She mentioned her history with a previous partner where anal was painful and he didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her, despite her clear boundaries. He's even called her names like \"asshole\" and accused her of being prude.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author clearly communicated her no to anal sex. Her boyfriend isn't respecting that, keeps pushing, and even dismisses her past trauma. The fact that he's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" ignores her stated reasons. Also, calling her names and pressuring her shows a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nIn any healthy relationship, consent is ongoing and boundaries must be respected. The boyfriend's behavior is manipulative and doesn't take her feelings into account. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary, especially given her past. She's even considering ending the relationship because his behavior is toxic. So the answer here would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
