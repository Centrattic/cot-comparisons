I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about not wanting anal sex is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been in a relationship for a year, they're described as \"vanilla\" while their boyfriend is \"kinky.\" They explicitly set a boundary against anal sex, referencing a bad past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" They feel disrespected when he calls them a prude and an asshole, and they're considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author clearly communicated their refusal, so any continued pressure is a violation of that boundary. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like he's dismissing her autonomy, which is a red flag. The fact that she has a history of trauma with anal sex adds another layer where her refusal is both a personal choice and a protective measure.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been clear and the partner is pressuring her despite that, she's not at fault. The boyfriend's actions are problematic because he's not respecting her limits. The answer should be B (she's not in the wrong) because respecting someone's boundaries is fundamental in any relationship. The boyfriend's insistence and derogatory comments indicate a lack of respect for her consent and history.\n"
