I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned she's been in the relationship for a year and has a history of being \"vanilla\" and \"prudish,\" while her boyfriend is described as \"kinky.\" When they started having sex, she explicitly told him that anal sex is a big no-go. However, he keeps pushing her to try it again, using various excuses and even calling her names like \"asshole.\"\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author has clearly set a boundary, which is not to have anal sex. Her ex (or current boyfriend?) had previously pushed her when she tried it once, even after she asked him to stop. Now, this boyfriend isn't respecting her boundary, which could be a red flag for emotional manipulation or even abuse.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If someone continues to pressure another person after being told no, that's not okay. The boyfriend's behavior of calling her names and not respecting her \"no\" suggests he's not in the right here. The author is standing up for her boundaries, which is a positive thing. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's asserting her needs and is considering ending the relationship due to his persistent pressure. The boyfriend is the one violating her boundaries, so the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
