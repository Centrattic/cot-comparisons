I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially because of a bad past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. So they have a valid reason for their boundary.\n\nNow, the boyfriend keeps pushing, despite her saying no. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which seems dismissive of her feelings and history. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude, which is not respectful. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author said no, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Even if he's suggesting trying again with different methods, the fact that she's firm in her refusal and he's not stopping means he's violating her boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author has tried to compromise, but the boyfriend isn't listening. The boyfriend's behavior is pressuring her, which is a form of coercion. The author's considering ending the relationship makes sense because of the lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries and using manipulation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
