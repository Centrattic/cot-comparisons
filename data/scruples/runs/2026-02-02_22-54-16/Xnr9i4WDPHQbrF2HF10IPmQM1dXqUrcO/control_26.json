I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author has a history where a previous partner didn't respect her boundary and continued despite her asking to stop. That's a red flag. Now, her current boyfriend is pressuring her again for anal sex even after she's clearly said no. She's mentioned it's a firm boundary, but he keeps pushing with various excuses and even called her names.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated her limits clearly. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries and is using manipulation. The fact that he's called her an asshole and mocked her for being prude shows a lack of respect. The author considering ending the relationship is a reasonable response because consent and respect are foundational in any relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, as long as she's not agreeing to something she doesn't want, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
