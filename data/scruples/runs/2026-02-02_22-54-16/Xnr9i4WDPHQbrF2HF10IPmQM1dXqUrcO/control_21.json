I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring her for anal sex, despite her clear boundaries and past negative experience. \n\nFirst, the woman set a boundary from the start. She told him anal was a no-go. She also shared a past traumatic experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend is persistently pushing her on this, using various arguments and even making her feel like a prude. He's called her an asshole, which is pretty harsh.\n\nHer main issue is that she's not willing to cross this boundary, even though they've been together a year. The key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her no, and that's a red flag. The fact that he's pressuring her repeatedly and dismissing her reasons suggests he's not listening to her needs. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If he can't accept her limits, that's a problem. The fact that the author is considering ending the relationship might indicate that she's prioritizing her own comfort and well-being, which is valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling her names and not respecting her stated boundaries\u2014shows a lack of respect. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her no. So, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
