I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex. The author says they're with their boyfriend for a year, they're vanilla, he's kinky. When they started having sex, he asked about boundaries, and she clearly stated anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience with it before where it hurt and he didn't stop when told. Now he keeps pushing and she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and boundaries. If someone sets a clear boundary and the other person continues to pressure or disregard it, that's a problem. The boyfriend is ignoring her \"no\" and is pressuring her, even calling her names. The author is standing by her boundary, which is her right. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like emotional manipulation and maybe even emotional abuse. So the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her boundary and considering ending the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
