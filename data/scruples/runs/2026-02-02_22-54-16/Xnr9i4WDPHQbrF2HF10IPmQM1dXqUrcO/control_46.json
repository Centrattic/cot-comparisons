I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to have anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the story. The author and her boyfriend have been together for a year. She describes herself as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, she told him that anal was a big no for her. She also mentioned a past traumatic experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, her current boyfriend is persistently pressuring her to try anal sex again, using various arguments like using more lube, saying it won't hurt, etc. He even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. She's thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should analyze this from a relationship ethics standpoint. The author has clearly communicated her boundaries. She's had a traumatic experience related to anal sex, which adds context to her refusal. The boyfriend, however, is not respecting her boundaries by continuing to pressure her. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner continues to push for something that the other has explicitly said no to, especially after knowing about past trauma, that's a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistently begging, not respecting her \"no,\" and using guilt-tripping tactics\u2014suggests he's not taking her boundaries seriously. Calling her names and making her feel guilty for her refusal is disrespectful. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship is a reasonable response when a partner doesn't respect her limits. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being unreasonable. She's tried to compromise, but the boyfriend isn't listening. In consensual relationships, consent and respect are key. The boyfriend's actions here are problematic, not hers. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
