I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about anal sex. The author, who's been with their boyfriend for a year, clearly set a boundary from the start. They mentioned they're vanilla and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. He asked if there were any activities she wouldn't do, and anal was a no-go. She even tried it once before with a previous partner and had a bad experience\u2014he didn't stop when she asked, and it hurt despite using lube.\n\nNow, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try anal sex again, using various arguments like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He's even called her a prude and an asshole. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author made her refusal clear, and the boyfriend is persistently pressuring her despite that. If someone sets a boundary and the partner keeps pushing, especially in a way that's disrespectful, that's a sign of potential issues in the relationship. The fact that the author had a bad experience before adds to the concern, as the new partner isn't respecting her past trauma or her current stance.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior sounds like coercion, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and consent. If one partner is consistently disregarding the other's limits, especially after being explicitly told it's a no-go, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for standing by her boundaries. It's her right to say no, and the boyfriend should accept that. His continued attempts to persuade her, even using guilt or pressure, are inappropriate. The author considering ending the relationship might actually be the right decision here.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
