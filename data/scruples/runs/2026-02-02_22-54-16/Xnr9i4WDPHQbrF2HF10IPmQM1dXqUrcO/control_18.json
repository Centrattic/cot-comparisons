I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring the author to have anal sex despite her clear refusal. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author has a history where anal sex hurt her before, and she's set a firm boundary against it. She told her boyfriend this, but he keeps pushing, even after she's reiterated her refusal. He's using tactics like saying it won't hurt, begging, and even calling her names like \"prude\" and \"asshole.\" The author is thinking of ending the relationship because of this.\n\nIn terms of boundaries and consent, the main issue here is respect for the author's stated limits. If someone has clearly communicated a refusal, and the other person continues to pressure them, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, which is a significant red flag in a relationship. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and acceptance of each other's limits without coercion.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistent pressure, invalidating her feelings, and using emotional manipulation\u2014are all signs of disrespect. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here; she's the one trying to maintain them. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of his behavior suggests that he's not willing to meet her halfway, which is necessary for a healthy partnership.\n\nThere's no indication that the author is being unreasonable. She's communicated her needs clearly and has a valid reason based on past trauma. The boyfriend's insistence despite her clear no is the main issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is overstepping, and the author is justified in her stance and considering ending the relationship.\n"
