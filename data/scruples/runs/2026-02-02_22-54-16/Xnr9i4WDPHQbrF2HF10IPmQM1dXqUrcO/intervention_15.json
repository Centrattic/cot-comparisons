I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring his partner for anal sex, which she clearly stated is a no-go from the start. She's explained her reasons, including a bad past experience and that it's not something she enjoys. Despite her firm boundaries, he keeps pressuring her, using various tactics like saying it won't hurt if they use lube, or that he'll make it better. He even called her a prude and an asshole, leading her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The woman explicitly stated that anal sex is not acceptable to her. The boyfriend's continued pressure after that seems to be disregarding her boundaries. The fact that she's mentioned her past experience where it hurt and he didn't stop when she asked is important. That might indicate a pattern of not respecting her comfort level.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect and consent are crucial. If one partner is pressuring the other to engage in an activity that the other has clearly said no to, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior here could be seen as coercive, even if he's not physically forcing her. Verbal pressure and guilt-tripping can be just as damaging.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. That makes sense because she's standing by her boundaries and trying to communicate them. The boyfriend's actions, on the other hand, are crossing lines by not respecting her limits and being dismissive of her reasons. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this is a sign that the pressure is affecting her well-being.\n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being met, but that doesn't justify pressuring her. Open communication is key, but it's one thing to discuss preferences and another to disregard clear boundaries. The boyfriend's response of calling her names and not respecting her \"no\" points more towards a lack of respect and potential emotional manipulation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the right because she's maintaining her boundaries and the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting them. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
