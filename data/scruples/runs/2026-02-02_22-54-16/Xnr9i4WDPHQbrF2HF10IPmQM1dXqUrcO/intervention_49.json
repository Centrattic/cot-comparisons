I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author has been with their boyfriend for a year. They describe themselves as \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. When they first started having sex, he asked what they wouldn't do, and she explicitly said anal sex was a no-go. She mentions she tried it once with a previous partner, used a lot of lube, but it hurt, and when she told them to stop, they didn't. Now, her current boyfriend is persistently asking her to try anal again. She's told him it's a firm no, that there's a lot she's willing to do but not anal. He keeps pushing her with comments like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube,\" \"pleassee,\" and \"But you've never tried it with me!\" She's also been called an asshole and a prude, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take. First, I need to determine if the answer is A or B. The options are whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nKey points here: The author set a clear boundary that anal sex is off-limits. She has a past trauma related to anal sex, which she's shared with her boyfriend. Despite this, he's not respecting her boundary and is pressuring her, using manipulative language and called her names. She's compromising by suggesting other activities but he's ignoring that. The boyfriend's behavior is persistent and dismissive of her reasons. \n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, the author is not at fault for maintaining her limits. The boyfriend is the one pushing despite her clear no. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship is a logical step given the disrespect shown. The boyfriend's actions of continuing to pressure and not respecting her previously stated boundary are the red flags here. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is the one being inconsiderate and not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to engage in something she's already said no to, especially with a negative experience in the past. The boyfriend's insistence and derogatory comments are the issues.\n"
