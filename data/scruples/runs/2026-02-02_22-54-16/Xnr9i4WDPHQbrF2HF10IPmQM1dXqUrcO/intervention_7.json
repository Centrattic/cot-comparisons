I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. The key issue here is anal sex. The author clearly stated that anal sex is a hard no for her, and she even mentioned a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and he didn't stop when she asked. She communicated this boundary to her current boyfriend initially. Now, he keeps pressuring her to try it again, despite her firm refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which she finds dismissive. He's also called her a prude and an asshole. She's thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nSo, from a consent and respect standpoint, the boyfriend is violating her boundaries. The author has already set a limit, and he's not respecting that. Even if he thinks she might change her mind, continued pressure after clear refusals is not acceptable. The fact that she has a negative history with anal sex adds another layer, showing that the issue isn't just about preference but past trauma. The boyfriend's reactions\u2014calling her names and not respecting her no\u2014are signs of disrespect and potential emotional abuse. The author's considering ending the relationship is a reasonable response when boundaries are consistently disregarded.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that he wants to explore sexual activities together, but that shouldn't come at the expense of her comfort and safety. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner is pressuring the other into activities they're against, that's a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her limits and is standing by them. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here, not her for wanting to maintain her boundaries. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
