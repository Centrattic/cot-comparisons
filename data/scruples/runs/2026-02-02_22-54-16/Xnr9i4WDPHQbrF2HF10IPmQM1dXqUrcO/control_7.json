I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex with a boyfriend. The author has clearly stated their boundary and has a bad history with it. The boyfriend keeps pushing, even after being told it's a no-go. \n\nFirst, the author set a boundary when they started the relationship. The boyfriend asked what they wouldn't do, and the author specified anal sex. Then the author even tried it once with someone else, which was painful and the partner didn't stop when told. That's a red flag right there.\n\nNow the current boyfriend is persistently asking, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and ignoring her refusal. The author says they've tried compromising, but the boyfriend refuses. He also called her an asshole and a prude, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has made their stance clear, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Even if the boyfriend wants to try different things, the author's refusal should be honored. The fact that he keeps pushing and even uses past experiences (from another partner) as an argument is problematic. Also, the verbal abuse (\"you're an asshole\") is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one violating her boundaries and not respecting her wishes. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship is justified because consent requires mutual respect, and the boyfriend's behavior indicates a lack of that.\n"
