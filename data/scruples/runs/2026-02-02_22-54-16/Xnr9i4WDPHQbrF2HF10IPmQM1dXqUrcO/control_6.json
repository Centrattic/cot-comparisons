I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her boundary from the start. She told her boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially after a negative experience with a previous partner. She's tried to compromise, but he keeps pushing. Now he's pressuring her, making her feel bad by calling her names like a prude or an asshole. She's even considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her limits, which is a red flag. The author has every right to set her boundaries, especially after trauma. The fact that he's pressuring her despite her clear no is problematic. In healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's limits without coercion. The boyfriend's behavior is controlling and dismissive of her feelings. The author isn't in the wrong here; she's standing up for herself. The answer should be B.\n"
