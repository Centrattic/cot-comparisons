I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So the situation is about anal sex in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has been with her boyfriend for a year. She describes herself as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, she clearly told him that anal was a firm no, and she even shared a bad experience where her previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"never tried it with me.\" She's told him again it's a boundary but he keeps pressuring her, even calling her an asshole and calling her prude. She's thinking of breaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. She set a clear boundary and communicated it. He's not respecting that by persistently asking and even making derogatory comments. The fact that she tried to be open (she mentioned compromising) but he refused suggests that he's not honoring her limits. Also, her past experience where the partner didn't stop when she said to is a red flag, and it's important that he knows this yet still pressures her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend is definitely in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for the disrespectful language. The author isn't in the wrong because she's standing by her choices and has communicated them clearly. Pressuring someone beyond their stated boundaries is a violation of consent. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
