I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the background: They've been together a year. She's not into kink, he is. She told him from the start that anal sex is a big no for her. She tried it once before with a partner who didn't stop when she said to, which left a bad experience. Now her current boyfriend keeps pushing her, even after she said it's a firm no. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and other convincing tactics. She's feeling pressured, he's called her a prude, and she's thinking of breaking up.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and boundaries. She set a clear boundary, and he's not respecting it. Even if he's interested in anal sex, that doesn't mean she has to comply. The fact that she has a prior negative experience makes it even more important for him to respect her limits. Repeatedly pressuring someone after they've said no is a form of coercion, which is a no-go in healthy relationships. Also, calling her names like \"asshole\" and being dismissive of her reasons shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and feelings. \n\nThe key here is that consent is ongoing and must be mutual. Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean they have to do everything their partner wants. Respecting boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior is inappropriate because he's not respecting her boundaries, even after she's clearly stated them. The author is not in the wrong because she's asserting her autonomy and her right to say no. Ending the relationship might be a difficult but necessary step if he can't respect her boundaries."
