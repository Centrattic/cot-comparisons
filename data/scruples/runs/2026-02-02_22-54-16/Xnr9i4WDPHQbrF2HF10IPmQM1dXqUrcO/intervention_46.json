I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a dealbreaker for the author, while the boyfriend keeps pushing despite being told it's a no-go.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start. They mentioned their past experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when asked. That's a significant red flag. Now, the current boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure them. Repeating \"no\" and having the other person keep pushing is a classic sign of not respecting consent. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions, like calling the author a prude and using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me,\" suggest he's not taking their boundaries seriously. The fact that he's called them an asshole and keeps badgering them shows a lack of respect and consideration. \n\nIn healthy relationships, boundaries are supposed to be respected. The author isn't the one violating any rules here. They've communicated their limits, and the boyfriend is the one refusing to acknowledge them. So, the answer should be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
