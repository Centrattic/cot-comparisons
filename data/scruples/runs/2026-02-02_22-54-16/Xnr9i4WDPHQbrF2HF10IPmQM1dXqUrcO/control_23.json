I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex. The situation involves a one-year relationship where the author has clearly communicated their boundary. The boyfriend is pressuring her despite her refusal and past negative experiences.\n\nFirst, the author set a boundary from the start. She's been clear that anal sex is a no-go, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner. The boyfriend, however, is pushing her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and implying that her refusal is due to not trying it with him. Even after she reiterates her stance, he continues to pressure her and calls her names like \"prude\" and \"asshole.\"\n\nRespecting boundaries is crucial in any healthy relationship. The boyfriend isn't respecting her established boundary, and his behavior is escalating. Pressuring someone to engage in sexual activity they've explicitly refused is a red flag. The author is considering ending the relationship, which might be a necessary step if the pressure continues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be no because she's setting and maintaining her boundaries, and the boyfriend is the one violating them by pressuring her. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's refusal. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n"
