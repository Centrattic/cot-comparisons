I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundaries from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex was a no-go, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner. The boyfriend, however, keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling her a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship because the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author set a clear boundary, and the boyfriend is pressuring her to cross it despite her refusal. That's not okay. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's limits. The boyfriend's behavior sounds manipulative and dismissive of her feelings. The fact that he even called her an asshole and questioned her prudishness adds to the disrespect.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is standing by her boundaries and the boyfriend is the one not respecting them, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's refusal. She has every right to say no, and the boyfriend should accept that or face the consequences, like the potential end of the relationship.\n"
