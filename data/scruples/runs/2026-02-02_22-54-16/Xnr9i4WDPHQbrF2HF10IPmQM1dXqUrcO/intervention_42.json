I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about the author not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend, who keeps pressuring them despite the clear boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the story. The author has been with their boyfriend for a year. They described themselves as \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is described as \"kinky.\" When they started having sex, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and the author explicitly stated that anal sex was a no-go. They had a bad experience before where it hurt, and the previous partner didn't stop even when asked. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring them again with various arguments, calling them a prude, and even an asshole. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated their limit clearly, but the boyfriend is not respecting that. The author's history with anal sex is painful, and they've already set a boundary. The boyfriend's continued pressure, using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube,\" suggests he's dismissing her experience and not taking her no seriously.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one person has a boundary and the other keeps pushing despite being told no, that's a violation of consent. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as manipulation or coercion. The fact that he calls her names and pressures her indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author is trying to compromise, but the boyfriend isn't willing to accept her boundary. This is a red flag in a relationship. The author's consideration to end the relationship seems justified given the pressure and disrespect shown.\n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has communicated their boundary clearly and has a valid reason based on past trauma. The boyfriend's actions are the issue because he's not respecting her limits. It's important in relationships to honor each other's boundaries without pressure or coercion. The author is not at fault here.\n"
