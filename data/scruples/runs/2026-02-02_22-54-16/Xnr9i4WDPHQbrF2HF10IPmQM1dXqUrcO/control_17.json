I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring the author to have anal sex, despite her clear refusal and past negative experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author states that they've been together for a year and she's very vanilla, while he's into kink. She told him upfront that anal sex was a no-go, and she even tried it once before with a previous partner where it hurt and he didn't stop when she asked. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her, saying things like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has communicated her boundary clearly. The boyfriend is not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure her. Pressuring someone into a sexual act they've refused is a form of coercion, which is a violation of consent. Even if he's trying to persuade her with different techniques or reassurances, the fact that she's said no multiple times and he's still pushing is problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend also called her an asshole and accused her of being prude, which adds emotional manipulation to the mix. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner is unwilling to accept the other's limits, that's a red flag. The author's consideration to end the relationship seems reasonable given the lack of respect for her consent and the coercive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be any validity to the boyfriend's perspective? Maybe he feels his needs aren't met, but that doesn't justify pressuring her. The author has already tried compromising by suggesting other activities, so the issue isn't about her being unwilling to try anything. The problem is a specific boundary she's not willing to cross, which is her right. The boyfriend's response is what's inappropriate here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is violating her boundaries and engaging in coercive behavior, which is a serious issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
