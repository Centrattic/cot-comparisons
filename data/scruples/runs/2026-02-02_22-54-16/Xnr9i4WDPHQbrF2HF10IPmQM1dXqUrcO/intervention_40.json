I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple has been together for a year. The author is described as vanilla and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. When they first started having sex, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and she clearly stated that anal sex was a no-go. She mentions a past experience where she tried anal sex once, it hurt, and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring her again, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He's even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants confirmation. So I need to evaluate if her stance is valid. \n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, it's crucial that both partners respect each other's limits. The author made her boundary clear initially, and the boyfriend is now pressuring her, which is a red flag. The fact that the author has a traumatic past experience with anal sex adds another layer. Pressuring someone after knowing their history seems disrespectful and potentially abusive.\n\nThe boyfriend's responses, like dismissing her concerns and invalidating her feelings, indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, not just for each other's preferences but also for past experiences that affect current boundaries. The boyfriend's use of guilt-tripping (\"you've never tried it with me\") and name-calling (\"asshole,\" \"prude\") further shows that he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nCompromise is important in relationships, but it shouldn't force someone to cross a boundary they've clearly set. The author has tried to be open about other things but is firm on this one. The boyfriend's insistence suggests he's not willing to accept her limits, which is a major issue.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is pressuring her into something she's not comfortable with, which violates her boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
