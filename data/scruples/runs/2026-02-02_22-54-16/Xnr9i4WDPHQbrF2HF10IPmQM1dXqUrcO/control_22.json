I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend, who keeps pressuring them for it. \n\nFirst, the author mentioned they've been with their boyfriend for a year and are very vanilla, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, they clearly told him that anal was off-limits. They also had a bad experience with anal sex before, where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when asked. Now, the boyfriend is persistently asking and pressuring them to try it again, despite the author's firm refusal. He uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and ignores their boundary. He even called them an asshole and called them a prude.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author has set a clear boundary and communicated it. The boyfriend is not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure and push for something she's refused. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because of this pressure suggests that he's not respecting her no, which is a red flag.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. If someone keeps pushing for something that the other person has said no to, that's not okay. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary they're comfortable with. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014persisting despite refusal, invalidating her experience, and using manipulation tactics\u2014is problematic. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her limits, which is a major issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
