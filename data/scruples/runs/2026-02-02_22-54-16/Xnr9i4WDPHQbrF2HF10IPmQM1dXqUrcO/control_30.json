I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about anal sex. The author has a boyfriend who's into kink, but she's vanilla and prudish. She told him upfront that anal sex is a no-go because of a bad experience before. Now he keeps pushing her, saying it'll be okay with lube, etc., and she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and boundaries. The author clearly set a boundary from the start. The boyfriend, however, isn't respecting that and is pressuring her. That's a red flag. The key points here are that she's communicated her limits, he's not respecting them, and he's using manipulative tactics like guilt-tripping and calling her names. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners respect each other's boundaries. If one partner keeps pushing despite clear \"no,\" that's not okay. The fact that he called her an asshole and called her prude shows he's not respecting her feelings. The author is standing her ground, which is correct. She's even considering ending things because he's not respecting her, which makes sense. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The boyfriend is the one violating her boundaries. The author did the right thing by setting limits and trying to compromise. The boyfriend's behavior is unacceptable, and the author is justified in considering ending the relationship. There's no indication that she's wrong here. She's just trying to maintain her comfort and safety in the relationship.\n"
