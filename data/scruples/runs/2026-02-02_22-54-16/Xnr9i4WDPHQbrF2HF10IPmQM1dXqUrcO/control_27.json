I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend, who keeps pressuring them despite their clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is in a one-year relationship. They described themselves as vanilla and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. When they started having sex, the author explicitly stated that anal was a deal-breaker, and they had a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when asked. Now, the boyfriend is persistently asking and even dismissive when they say no. He's called the author an asshole and accused them of being prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting boundaries. The author has communicated their no-go clearly, but the boyfriend isn't respecting that. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to engage in something that their partner wants. \n\nIn relationships, consent and communication are crucial. The author has set a boundary, and the boyfriend's behavior of not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure and even using hurtful language is problematic. The boyfriend's actions\u2014like not stopping when told, pressuring, and making derogatory comments\u2014are signs of disrespect for the author's autonomy. \n\nThe author's past negative experience adds context; it's a valid reason to have a boundary. The boyfriend's insistence might be seen as not taking the author's comfort and safety seriously. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner consistently disregards the other's limits, it's a red flag. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't wrong for maintaining their boundary. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
