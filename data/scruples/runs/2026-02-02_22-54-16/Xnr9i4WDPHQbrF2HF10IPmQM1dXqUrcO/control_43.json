I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been in a relationship for a year. They consider themselves vanilla and prudish, while their boyfriend is described as kinky. When they started having sex, the boyfriend asked if there were any activities the author would refuse. She clearly stated that anal sex was a no-go. She also mentioned a past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her for anal sex, despite her firm refusal. He uses arguments like using lube, not hurting, and that she hasn't tried it with him. He even called her an asshole and accused her of being prude. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and respect for boundaries. The author set a clear boundary from the beginning. She has a valid reason based on a bad past experience and communicated her refusal multiple times. The boyfriend is pressuring her, which is not okay. Even if he's interested in anal sex, respecting her \"no\" is essential. The fact that he dismissed her concerns and continued to push suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her limits and considering the relationship's future if those limits aren't respected. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
