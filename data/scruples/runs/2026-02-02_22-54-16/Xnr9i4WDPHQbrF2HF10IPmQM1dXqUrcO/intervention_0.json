I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in a relationship. The author is a woman who's been with her boyfriend for a year. She's described as vanilla and prudish, while he's into kink. They had a conversation at the start where she set a boundary against anal sex. She tried it once before with a previous partner, which was painful and traumatic, and he knows that. Now the boyfriend is pushing her to try it again, even after she's said it's a firm no. He's using various tactics like arguing about lube, begging, and calling her a prude. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and respecting boundaries. The author clearly communicated her boundary, which the boyfriend is ignoring. He's pressuring her despite her past negative experience and her clear refusal. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If one partner is pressuring the other into something they don't want to do, that's a problem. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like coercion, which is a red flag. The fact that he's called her an asshole and criticized her for being prude also adds to the toxic behavior. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for her own boundaries. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not respecting her autonomy. Even if he has different preferences, he needs to accept her limits. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship is a valid response to someone who isn't respecting her no. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
