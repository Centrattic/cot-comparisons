I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about anal sex being a dealbreaker for the author, but the boyfriend keeps pushing despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the user's question is about. The main issue here is the boyfriend not respecting the author's boundary. She has a history where she had a bad experience with anal sex and told him it's a no-go. Now he's pressuring her even after she's firm. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author set a clear boundary, the boyfriend isn't respecting it, and she's considering ending the relationship. In terms of right or wrong, respecting boundaries is a big part of healthy relationships. If someone isn't respecting another's boundaries, that's a problem. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions here\u2014persistently begging, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube,\" and even calling her a prude\u2014suggest he's dismissing her feelings and not taking her no seriously. That's not healthy. The author's response is to consider ending the relationship, which makes sense if someone isn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, the answer would be no because she's standing by her boundaries. The boyfriend is the one not respecting them, which makes him the one in the wrong. So the answer should be B for No.\n"
