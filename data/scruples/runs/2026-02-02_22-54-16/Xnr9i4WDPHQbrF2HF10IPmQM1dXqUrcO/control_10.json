I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend is pushing for anal sex despite the girlfriend's clear refusal and past negative experience.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend set a boundary early on. She mentioned she's \"vanilla\" and the boyfriend is more \"kinky.\" When they started having sex, she explicitly told him anal was a no-go. She even had a bad experience with anal sex before, where her previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now, the boyfriend is pressuring her again, using various tactics like saying it won't hurt if they use lube and questioning her openness. He's even called her names like \"prude\" and \"asshole.\"\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The girlfriend made her stance clear, yet the boyfriend continues to push. Even if he's curious or wants to explore his kink, he can't override her boundaries. The fact that he's dismissing her reasons and using manipulative language is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, communication, and consent. If one partner is pressuring the other into something they're uncomfortable with, that's a violation of consent.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response of calling her names shows a lack of respect. The girlfriend's feeling of needing to end the relationship is a valid reaction to the ongoing pressure and disrespect. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one violating boundaries by not respecting her \"no.\" Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
