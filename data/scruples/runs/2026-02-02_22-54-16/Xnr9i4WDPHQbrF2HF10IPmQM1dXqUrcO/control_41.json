I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kinky stuff. She's been clear from the start that anal sex is a no-go for her. She tried it once before, it hurt, and the guy didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pushing her, despite her firm refusal. He's even called her names like \"asshole\" and accused her of being prude. She's thinking of breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author set a boundary early on and reiterated it. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary, even after she's explained her reasons and past trauma. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014harassment, not respecting her limits, name-calling\u2014is problematic. In healthy relationships, communication and respect for boundaries are crucial. If one partner is pressuring the other to engage in an activity they've clearly refused, that's a red flag. The fact that the author has a past negative experience with anal sex adds another layer; the boyfriend should be sensitive to that history. The boyfriend's insistence despite her refusal and his derogatory remarks indicate a lack of respect. The author is considering ending the relationship, which might be a necessary step to protect her own well-being. So, the answer would likely be that the boyfriend is the asshole, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
