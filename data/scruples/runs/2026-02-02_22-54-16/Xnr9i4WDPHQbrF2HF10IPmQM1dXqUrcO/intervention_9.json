I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the woman doesn't want to have anal sex, but her boyfriend keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The woman has a history of a bad experience with anal sex where it hurt and her previous partner didn't stop when she asked. She told her current boyfriend from the start that anal is a no-go. Now he's pressuring her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling her a prude. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nRespecting boundaries is crucial in any relationship, especially in intimate matters. The woman set a clear boundary that she doesn't want anal sex. The boyfriend, despite knowing this, continues to pressure her. That's not respectful. Even if he's interested in anal sex, he shouldn't push her beyond her comfort zone. The fact that she's tried to compromise but he refuses adds to the issue. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of calling her an asshole and mocking her for being prude is also problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If one partner is pressuring the other to do something they're uncomfortable with, especially after being told it's a hard limit, that's a red flag. \n\nHer previous experience where her partner didn't respect her when she asked to stop is relevant here. It shows a pattern where her boundaries weren't respected, which might make her more cautious now. The current boyfriend's persistence could be triggering or retraumatizing her. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one violating her boundaries by pressuring and dismissing her feelings. So the answer should be B.\n"
