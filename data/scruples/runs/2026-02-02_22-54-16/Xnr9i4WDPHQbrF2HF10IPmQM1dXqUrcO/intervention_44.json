I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear from the start that anal sex is a no-go for them. They even mentioned a past experience where it was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. That's important because it shows a valid reason for their boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary. He keeps pushing and even called the author names. The author is considering breaking up because of this. Boundaries in a relationship should be respected. If someone continues to pressure another person after they've said no, that's not okay. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author communicated their limits, and the boyfriend isn't honoring them. Even if the boyfriend is kinky, that doesn't mean he can disregard his partner's boundaries. The fact that he's using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" suggests he's not listening to her past experience and current feelings. \n\nAlso, calling her an asshole is pretty clear disrespect. So the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting anal sex, and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
