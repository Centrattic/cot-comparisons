I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author has already communicated her refusal, and even mentioned a past negative experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when she asked. That's a red flag right there. The current boyfriend isn't respecting her boundary, continues to push, and even uses derogatory terms like \"asshole\" and calls her a prude. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend isn't respecting her \"no,\" which is a violation of consent. Consent isn't just about agreeing to something; it's about not doing something when the other person says no. The boyfriend's insistence and the tactics he's using (like dismissing her feelings and making her feel guilty) are signs of disrespect and potential emotional manipulation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author has tried to compromise and the boyfriend refuses to meet her halfway shows that the issue isn't about her being closed-minded but about his unwillingness to accept her limits. The key here is that consent can't be coerced or pressured. If someone continues to pursue a no, that's not just inconsiderate\u2014it's abusive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting clear boundaries and trying to maintain a respectful relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem, not hers. She's right to consider ending the relationship if he's not willing to respect her boundaries. Answer B.\n"
