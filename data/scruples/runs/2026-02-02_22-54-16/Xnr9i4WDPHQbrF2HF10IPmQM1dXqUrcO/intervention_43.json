I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex as a dealbreaker for the author, who is in a relationship with a partner that's pushing for it despite the author's clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they've been in the relationship for a year, and they're \"vanilla\" while the boyfriend is \"kinky.\" When they started, the author communicated their refusal to engage in anal sex, referencing a past negative experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. So, the author has a valid reason for their boundary, especially with a history of trauma or discomfort.\n\nThe boyfriend, however, keeps pressuring the author, suggesting different ways to make it work, ignoring their clear no. The author has tried to compromise but the boyfriend isn't listening, leading to the author considering ending the relationship. The boyfriend even called the author a prude and an \"asshole,\" which adds emotional abuse to the mix.\n\nThe key points here are communication of boundaries, respect for those boundaries, and the response when they're not respected. The author made their stance clear from the beginning. The boyfriend's continued pressure despite that is problematic. Respecting a partner's no is fundamental in any relationship. The boyfriend's behavior here is dismissive and potentially abusive, especially after being told it's a firm no and the author has past trauma related to it.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries without pressuring the other. The boyfriend's actions here are not respecting the author's autonomy and are crossing into coercive behavior. The author is not in the wrong for setting and maintaining their boundaries. The boyfriend's insistence and derogatory comments indicate a lack of respect for the author's limits, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's refusal to engage in something they've already stated is a no-go for them.\n"
