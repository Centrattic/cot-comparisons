I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is refusing anal sex, and their boyfriend is persistently pressuring them despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has established a firm boundary from the start, mentioning her past trauma where anal sex was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. She's communicated this to her current boyfriend, but he keeps pushing, using phrases like \"try this or that\" and making her feel like a prude. The boyfriend even called her an \"asshole,\" which is a red flag in terms of respect.\n\nIn healthy relationships, consent and respecting boundaries are crucial. The author is clear about her limits, and the boyfriend's continued pressure, especially after being told it's a no, suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that he's using guilt-tripping tactics (\"you've never tried it with me\") and minimizing her concerns (\"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\") are signs of manipulation rather than genuine consideration for her feelings.\n\nThe author considering ending the relationship is a valid response because a partner shouldn't force or pressure someone into activities they're not comfortable with. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into emotional abuse territory by dismissing her reasons and attacking her character. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries. The boyfriend is the one at fault for not respecting her no and pressuring her despite her clear communication. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
