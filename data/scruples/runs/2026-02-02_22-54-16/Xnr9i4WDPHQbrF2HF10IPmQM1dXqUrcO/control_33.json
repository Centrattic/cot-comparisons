I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about consent and boundaries in a relationship regarding anal sex.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundaries from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go. They also mentioned a negative past experience where someone didn't respect their request to stop. Now the boyfriend is pressuring them, not respecting their stated boundaries, and even calling them names like \"prude.\"\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend isn't accepting the author's \"no\" and is instead nagging and trying to manipulate them into changing their mind. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. If someone continues to push despite being told no, they're violating that boundary.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling the author an asshole and mocking their prudishness\u2014shows disrespect. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this pressure, which makes sense if the partner can't respect their boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, communicated them, and the issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting those. The answer should be B (No).\n"
