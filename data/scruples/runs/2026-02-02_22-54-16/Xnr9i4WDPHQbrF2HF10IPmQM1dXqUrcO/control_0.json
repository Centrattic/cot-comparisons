I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about whether anal sex is a dealbreaker in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has made it clear that anal sex is a no-go for them. They mentioned a bad past experience where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when asked. That's pretty important because consent and respecting boundaries are key in any relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend is persistently pushing for it, despite her clear refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" That sounds like gaslighting or minimizing her feelings and boundaries. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship because of this. Now, the question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to have anal sex. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for having her own boundaries. The problem here seems to be more on the boyfriend's side for not respecting those boundaries. If someone consistently disrespects your limits, especially after you've communicated them clearly, that's a red flag. The fact that the author has a history where it was painful and the partner didn't stop adds another layer of trauma.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries and persistently pushing for something she's against. That's not healthy, and it's okay for her to consider ending the relationship.\n"
