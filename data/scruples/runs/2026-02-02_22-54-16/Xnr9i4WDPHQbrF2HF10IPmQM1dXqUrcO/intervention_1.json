I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set boundaries from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially mentioning a bad experience with a previous partner where it hurt and they were pressured. That's a valid reason to have a boundary. \n\nThe boyfriend, however, keeps pushing despite being told it's a firm no. He uses phrases like \"please,\" \"it won't hurt,\" and even calls the author a prude. That sounds like pressure and maybe even disrespect for her boundaries. The author has tried compromising, but the boyfriend isn't respecting her limits. \n\nCalling someone an asshole and mocking their prudishness isn't healthy communication. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining her boundary. Since she communicated her no clearly and the boyfriend isn't respecting that, it's more about his behavior. The author isn't wrong for standing by her decision. \n\nAlso, the author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if the partner isn't respecting her limits. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
