I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex and a boundary issue in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary from the start. They told their boyfriend anal sex is a no-go, and they've had a bad experience with it before where it hurt. Now, the boyfriend is persistently pressuring them despite their clear refusal. The author is feeling harassed and considering ending the relationship.\n\nBoundaries in a relationship are crucial. When someone sets a boundary and the other person respects it, that's healthy. If they cross or ignore those boundaries, that's a problem. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014continuously begging, not respecting the no, and even calling the author names\u2014suggests he's not respecting their autonomy. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author has the right to say no, and the boyfriend should accept that. The fact that he keeps pushing and even uses guilt or manipulation tactics (like saying it won't hurt if you use lube) is a red flag. The author's decision to consider ending the relationship is valid because boundaries shouldn't be violated.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting their limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
