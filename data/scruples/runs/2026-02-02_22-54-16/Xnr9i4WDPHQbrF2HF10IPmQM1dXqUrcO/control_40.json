I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the author is averse to anal sex and the boyfriend is pressuring her. \n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her boundaries from the start. She mentioned her past negative experience and that she's against it. The boyfriend, however, is persistently pushing her despite her clear refusals. He's even using manipulative tactics like minimizing her concerns and making her feel like a prude.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her no, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect. The fact that he's called her names and continued to pressure her shows a lack of consideration. The author considering ending the relationship makes sense because boundaries shouldn't be ignored. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is wrong here. She's consistent in her stance and trying to compromise, but the issue is the boyfriend's refusal to accept her limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
