I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation involves a one-year relationship where the author is asexual, has clear boundaries against anal sex, and the boyfriend keeps pushing despite her refusal and past negative experiences.\n\nFirst, the author set a boundary upfront when they started having sex. They told the boyfriend anal sex is a no-go. The boyfriend then keeps pressuring her, even after she reinforces that boundary. The boyfriend's actions include dismissing her concerns, not respecting her past trauma, and using guilt or persuasion tactics. The key here is consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting the author's clear no, which is a fundamental part of a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on personal preference and a bad experience. The boyfriend's persistence, including calling her names and not acknowledging her reasons, shows a lack of respect. The fact that he's continuing to pressure her after she's already said no multiple times is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's limits. Since the author is standing by her boundaries and the boyfriend isn't respecting them, the fault lies with the boyfriend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
