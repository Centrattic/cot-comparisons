I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. The situation is that she's been in a one-year relationship, considers herself vanilla and prudish, while her boyfriend is into kink. She clearly set a boundary from the start, stating anal sex is a no-go. She even mentioned a past traumatic experience where it hurt despite using lube and the previous partner not respecting her stop. Now, her boyfriend keeps pressuring her, using various arguments, and even called her names. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Boundaries in a sexual relationship are crucial. The author communicated her boundary clearly at the beginning, which is a healthy step. Her boyfriend, however, is disregarding that boundary by continuing to pressure her. Even though he's interested in kink, mutual respect and consent are essential. Pressuring someone into an activity they've explicitly said no to is not okay. The fact that he's using manipulation tactics like \"it won't hurt if you use lube\" or \"you haven't tried it with me\" suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. His derogatory comments about her being a prude further indicate disrespect. The author's consideration to end the relationship seems justified given the ongoing pressure and lack of respect for her boundaries. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
