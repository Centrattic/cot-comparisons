I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"Ask an Anonymous\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author has been in a relationship for a year and made it clear that anal sex is a no-go from the start. Her boyfriend is into kink, but she's more vanilla and prudish. They had a conversation where she set that boundary, and he respected it initially. Now he's pushing her again, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author clearly stated her limit, so if the boyfriend is pressuring her now, that seems like a violation. Even if he's tried to reason or persuade her, that's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she's already tried it once in the past with a previous partner and it was a bad experience adds to the justification of her current stance. She's not being unreasonable here; she's maintaining a boundary she's already communicated.\n\nThen there's communication. The boyfriend isn't listening to her concerns and is instead dismissing them with his own arguments. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If he's not respecting her boundaries and is pressuring her, that's a red flag. The use of guilt trips and persistent begging shows that he's not respecting her \"no,\" which is a key part of consent.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response of calling her a prude and an asshole is pretty harsh. That's not a constructive way to handle a disagreement. It's attacking her character instead of acknowledging her feelings and boundaries. The author's consideration to end the relationship is a valid reaction, as respect and communication are essential in any partnership.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She set a clear boundary and is standing by it. The boyfriend is overstepping by not respecting her decision and using pressure tactics. The answer should be B.\n"
