I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. She's been in the relationship for a year and has a history of being asked about her boundaries early on. She clearly stated anal was a no-go, and she even tried it once with a previous partner where it was painful and he didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her despite her firm no. He uses phrases like it won't hurt if you use lube and other manipulative tactics. He's even called her an asshole and criticized her prudishness. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, consent and boundaries are key in any sexual relationship. The author communicated her boundary clearly when they started, so the boyfriend should respect that. Pressuring someone after they've said no is a form of disrespect and can be coercive. The fact that he's persistently trying to convince her and using guilt (\"But you've never tried it with me!\") suggests he's not taking her wishes seriously. The previous bad experience adds to her valid reasons for not wanting to engage in this activity again. \n\nCalling her names like \"asshole\" and labeling her as prude shows a lack of empathy and understanding. Healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and the ability to accept each other's boundaries without judgment. If he's not able to honor her boundaries, that's a red flag. The author's consideration of ending the relationship seems reasonable given the disrespect shown. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. She has the right to set boundaries and her partner's continued pressure and disrespect are the issues here.\n"
