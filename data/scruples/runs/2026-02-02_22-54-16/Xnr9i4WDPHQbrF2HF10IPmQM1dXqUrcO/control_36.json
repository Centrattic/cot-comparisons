I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in a relationship. The author has a history where their previous partner forced it despite her asking to stop, which caused pain and trauma. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her, even after she's set a firm boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go, and she tried it once before with negative results. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries by continuing to push her. Even if he's using kind words like \"please\" or suggesting it's different with him, the fact that she's already said no and he's not backing off is a problem.\n\nThen there's the issue of past trauma. The author mentions a bad experience, so the boyfriend's insistence might be triggering her. He should be supportive of her comfort zones rather than dismissing her feelings by calling her a prude or using that \"you've never tried it with me\" argument. That seems dismissive and not empathetic.\n\nCompromising is mentioned. She says she's tried to compromise, but he refuses. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If one partner isn't willing to respect the other's boundaries, that's a major red flag. The boyfriend's behavior here is pressuring her, which could be a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nThe boyfriend called her an asshole, which is pretty harsh. That shows a lack of respect and understanding. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this, which is a valid reaction when a partner isn't respecting her boundaries and is being dismissive.\n\nSo, from what I know about healthy relationships, the key elements are communication, consent, and respect. The author is not in the wrong because she's clearly communicated her boundaries and is standing by them. The boyfriend is the one not respecting those boundaries and pressuring her, which is the asshole behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
