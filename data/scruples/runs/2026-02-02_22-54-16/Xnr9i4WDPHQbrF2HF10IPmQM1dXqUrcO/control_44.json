I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's very vanilla and prudish. When they started, she told him anal was a no-go. She tried it once with a previous partner, it hurt, and he didn't stop when she told him to. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her for anal sex, saying it won't hurt if they use lube, etc. She's firm, but he keeps pushing, even calling her a prude and an asshole. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and boundaries. She made her boundary clear from the start. The boyfriend is pressuring her after she said no. That's a red flag. Pressuring someone after they've stated a boundary is not okay. The author isn't the one violating boundaries here. The boyfriend is. The fact that he's dismissing her concerns and using manipulative tactics like \"you haven't tried it with me\" shows he's not respecting her autonomy. The user is asking if she's wrong for not wanting anal sex. No, she's not wrong. It's her body, her choice. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Even if he's into kink, he shouldn't force her to engage in something she's against. The fact that she tried to compromise and he refused her boundaries is a problem. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
