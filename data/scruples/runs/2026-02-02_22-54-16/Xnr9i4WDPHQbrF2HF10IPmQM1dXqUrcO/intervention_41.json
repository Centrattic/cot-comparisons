I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to have anal sex with a boyfriend, who is more into kinky stuff. The user says they told their boyfriend it's a no-go, but he keeps pushing and even called them an asshole and accused them of being prude. They're considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has clearly communicated their boundary, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend, however, is pressuring them despite knowing the past negative experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships require respecting each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior seems manipulative and disrespectful, especially calling them names and dismissing their feelings. The author tried to compromise but the boyfriend refused, which shows he's not willing to respect their limits. The fact that the author has a bad history with it adds to the reason why they're firm. So, the boyfriend is in the wrong here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
