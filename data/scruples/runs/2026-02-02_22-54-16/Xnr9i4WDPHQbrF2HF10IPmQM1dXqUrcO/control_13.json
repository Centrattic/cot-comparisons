I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author has made it clear they don't want to have anal sex, but the boyfriend keeps pressuring them. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given information.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has a history of a bad experience with anal sex, which caused pain and was not respected when they asked to stop. They communicated their boundaries clearly to their current boyfriend, but he's not respecting that and continues to pressure them. The boyfriend is using emotional manipulation like guilt-tripping and making jokes (\"called me an asshole\"). The author is considering ending the relationship because the boyfriend isn't respecting their boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, consent and respecting boundaries are crucial. If someone has clearly stated a boundary and the other person keeps pushing despite the refusal, that's a violation. The boyfriend's behavior here is persistent pressure, which is a form of coercion. Even if he has different preferences, it's not acceptable to disregard the partner's limits. The author's refusal is valid, especially given their negative past experience. The boyfriend's actions, like calling the author names and not respecting their no, are signs of disrespect and potential emotional abuse.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a boundary and the boyfriend is the one not respecting it. The answer should be B.\n"
