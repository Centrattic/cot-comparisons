I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly stated their boundary upfront. They told their boyfriend from the start that anal sex is a no-go. They even mentioned a past experience where it was painful and the partner didn't stop when asked. That's a red flag for consent issues in the past.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is pressuring her again. He's using tactics like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" That sounds like manipulation. He's also called her names like \"asshole\" and called her prude, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author has already set a firm boundary, and the boyfriend is not respecting that. Even though he might be into kink, respecting no means no is essential. The author is within her right to refuse and even consider ending the relationship if the pressure continues.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong because she's standing by her boundaries and the boyfriend is pressuring her, which is wrong.\n"
