I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is in a relationship where they've clearly communicated that anal sex is a no-go, especially due to a bad past experience. Their boyfriend keeps pushing and pressuring them despite their clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about communication and respecting boundaries. The author told their boyfriend upfront that anal sex was off-limits, and the boyfriend didn't listen. He even mentioned a past experience where it hurt and they were told to stop. Now, the boyfriend is persistently trying to convince them again, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling the author a prude. The author feels pressured and is considering ending the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, consent and respecting boundaries are crucial. If someone has clearly stated a boundary and the other person keeps pushing, that's a sign of a problem. The boyfriend's behavior here seems manipulative and not respecting the author's autonomy. The fact that he called her an asshole and criticized her for being prude adds to the negative behavior.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, but the boyfriend isn't willing to accept their decision. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and the willingness to accept each other's limits. The boyfriend's inability to respect this boundary is a major issue. The author is within their right to set these boundaries and to end the relationship if the other person isn't respecting them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The main issue here is the boyfriend's behavior, not the author's refusal to engage in something they're uncomfortable with.\n"
