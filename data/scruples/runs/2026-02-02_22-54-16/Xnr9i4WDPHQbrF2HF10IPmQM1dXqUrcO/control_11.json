I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the woman refuses anal sex, and her boyfriend keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The woman has explicitly stated that anal sex is a no-go for her, especially given her past negative experience. She's communicated this boundary to her boyfriend. The boyfriend, however, is pressuring her, suggesting that he doesn't respect her limits. \n\nIn any healthy relationship, consent is crucial. If one partner has a clear boundary and the other continues to push despite that, the latter is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions here\u2014persistently asking, using phrases like \"pleassee,\" and even calling her a prude\u2014show a lack of respect for her stated limits. His comment about her being an \"asshole\" is particularly concerning as it's derogatory and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe woman's decision to consider ending the relationship is a valid response because her boundaries aren't being respected. She's tried to compromise, but he hasn't met her halfway. There's also the mention of a past traumatic experience with anal sex, which adds another layer of sensitivity. The boyfriend's insistence without considering her trauma is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries and continuing to pressure her. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
