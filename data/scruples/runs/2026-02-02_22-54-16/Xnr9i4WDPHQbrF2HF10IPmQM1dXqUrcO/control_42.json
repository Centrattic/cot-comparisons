I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person posting the question (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author states they're very vanilla and prudish, while their boyfriend is into kink. They had a conversation at the start where they set boundaries, specifically refusing anal sex. The boyfriend has since been pressuring them to try it again, despite their clear refusal. The author mentions a past bad experience where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when told. Now, the boyfriend is dismissing their boundaries, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling them a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's recall that in healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is crucial. The author clearly communicated their boundary, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Pressuring someone past their stated limits is a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior, including not respecting her past experience and continuing to push, indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her boundaries and considering ending the relationship because of the lack of respect. \n\nAnswer B (the author is not in the wrong) makes sense here. The key points are the clear communication of boundaries and the boyfriend's failure to honor them, which is a significant issue in any relationship.\n"
