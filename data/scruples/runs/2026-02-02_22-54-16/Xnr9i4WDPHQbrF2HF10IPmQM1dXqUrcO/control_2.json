I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend, despite his persistent requests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author clearly stated her boundary from the start, a year into the relationship. She mentioned a negative past experience where anal sex hurt and was forced, which is a serious issue. Now, her boyfriend is pressuring her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt with lube\" and dismissing her concerns. He even called her a prude and an asshole. The author is considering ending the relationship because he's not respecting her boundaries and is being abusive.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, the author has the right to set limits. The boyfriend's behavior seems coercive and disrespectful. The fact that he brought up her past trauma (\"you've never tried it with me\") is a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner is pressuring the other into an activity they've clearly stated is off-limits, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't compromising and is instead belittling her, which indicates a lack of respect. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding her boundaries and considering leaving a relationship where her needs aren't respected. So the answer is B.\n"
