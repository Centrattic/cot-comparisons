I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and a relationship conflict.\n\nFirst, the author has a history where they tried anal once before and it hurt, and the partner didn't stop when told. Now their current boyfriend keeps pushing them to try again, even after they've said it's a firm no. The boyfriend uses various tactics like saying it won't hurt with lube, or that they haven't tried it together. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nWell, consent and boundaries are key here. The author has clearly stated that anal sex is off-limits and has a traumatic experience. The boyfriend isn't respecting that boundary and continues to pressure them. Even if he's into kink, respecting the partner's no is essential. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior of pressuring and not respecting the boundary makes him the one in the wrong. The author is justified in considering ending the relationship if the partner isn't respectful. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
