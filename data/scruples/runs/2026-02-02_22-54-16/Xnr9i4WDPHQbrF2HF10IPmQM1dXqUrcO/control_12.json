I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the person is at fault for not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author and their boyfriend have been together for a year. The author describes themselves as \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is into kink. When they started having sex, the boyfriend asked if there were things she wouldn't do, and she explicitly said anal was a big no. She also mentioned she tried it once before, it hurt, and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. \n\nNow the boyfriend keeps pressuring her to have anal sex, despite her clear boundaries. He uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The author says she's tried compromising but he refuses. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author has communicated her discomfort and past negative experience clearly. If the boyfriend is continuing to pressure her after she's set a boundary, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions here seem to cross into disrespecting her limits. Pressuring someone into a sexual act they don't want is not okay. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her boundary. Ending the relationship might be a valid choice because the boyfriend is not respecting her no. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
