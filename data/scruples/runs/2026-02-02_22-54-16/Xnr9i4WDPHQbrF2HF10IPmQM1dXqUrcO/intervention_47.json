I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. The situation is outlined in the AITA post.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being uncomfortable with anal sex. She mentioned she's very vanilla and prudish, while her boyfriend is into kink. When they started the relationship, she clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. She even tried it once before with another partner, and it hurt a lot, and he didn't stop when she asked. Now, her current boyfriend is pressuring her despite her clear boundaries. He keeps suggesting ways to make it better, like using more lube, and even calls her a prude and an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The author has communicated her refusal multiple times, so the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. Even if someone is into kink, respecting a partner's no is crucial. The fact that the author has a negative past experience with anal sex and it's causing her trauma or discomfort adds another layer. The boyfriend's persistent pressure and dismissive comments (\"you're such a prude\") suggest he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If one partner keeps pushing for something that the other has explicitly said no to, especially in a sensitive area like anal sex, it's a red flag. The author considering ending the relationship is a valid response because her boundaries aren't being respected. So, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
