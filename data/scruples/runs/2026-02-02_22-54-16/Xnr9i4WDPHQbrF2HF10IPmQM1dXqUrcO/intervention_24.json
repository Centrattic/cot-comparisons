I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is in a year-long relationship. She's described as vanilla, while her boyfriend is kinky. When they started, she clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. She also mentioned a past trauma where her previous partner forced anal sex despite her asking to stop. Now, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He even called her an asshole and called her a prude. She's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author communicated her boundaries upfront. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries and is pressuring her, which is a form of coercion. Especially considering her past trauma, his persistence could be triggering. The fact that he's dismissing her concerns and using guilt-tripping tactics is problematic. The author is not the one in the wrong because she's standing by her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here because he's not respecting her limits and is pressuring her into something she's uncomfortable with. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
