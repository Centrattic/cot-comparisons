I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex being a boundary for the author, but the boyfriend keeps pushing despite her saying no.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated her boundaries upfront. She told her boyfriend that anal was a no-go, and she even mentioned a bad experience in the past. The boyfriend isn't respecting that and keeps pressuring her. Pressuring someone after they've set a boundary is a red flag. The boyfriend's actions include not stopping when she asked, which could indicate disregard for her consent. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing pressure. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into manipulation or coercion, especially with comments like calling her a prude and not respecting her past trauma. The key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong because she's setting clear limits and the issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting them. So the answer should be B.\n"
