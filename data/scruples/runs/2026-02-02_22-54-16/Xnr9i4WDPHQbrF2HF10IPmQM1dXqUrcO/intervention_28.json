I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves anal sex in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear from the start that anal sex is a firm no for them. They mentioned a past experience where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when they asked. Their current boyfriend is pushing for it despite their refusal. He's using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which the author finds dismissive of their boundary. The boyfriend even called the author an asshole and accused them of being prude. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set a clear boundary, the boyfriend is pressuring them to cross that boundary, and the boyfriend is not respecting their limits. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect for boundaries is essential. Pressuring someone to engage in sexual activities they've refused, especially after a traumatic experience, seems wrong. The boyfriend's responses indicate he's not taking their no seriously, and calling them names is a red flag. The author's consideration of ending the relationship shows they're taking their own comfort and limits seriously. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. They've communicated their limits and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. The answer should be B.\n"
