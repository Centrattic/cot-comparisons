I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's more vanilla and prudish. When they started having sex, she clearly stated that anal sex was a no-go. She even shared a bad experience where a previous partner forced anal sex despite her asking to stop. Now, her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try it again, using various arguments and even calling her a prude and an asshole. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author set clear boundaries from the start, which is good. Her past trauma is relevant because it explains her discomfort. The boyfriend, however, is not respecting her boundaries by persistently pushing her. Even though he might not be malicious, the fact that he's pressuring her after she's said no multiple times is a red flag. The use of phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" ignores her stated reasons, which include her history and current unwillingness. His calling her names and questioning her prudishness adds emotional manipulation to the mix.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior suggests he's not taking her limits seriously, which is a sign of disrespect. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries and trying to maintain them. Her considering ending the relationship is a valid response to someone who doesn't respect her consent and history. There's no indication she's being unreasonable; she's clear and consistent in her refusal. The boyfriend's actions, on the other hand, show a lack of respect for her autonomy. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
