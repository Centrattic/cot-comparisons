I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. From the context provided, the author has clearly communicated her boundaries. She mentioned she's never been comfortable with anal sex, even tried it once before but it was painful and forced. Her boyfriend isn't respecting her no, keeps pressuring her, and even called her names.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author set a clear boundary from the start, and the boyfriend is disregarding that. Repeatedly pressuring someone after they've said no is a form of manipulation and disrespect. The fact that he used lube but still forced the first time is also a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning because he's not respecting her autonomy, which is essential in any healthy relationship.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, but that doesn't seem right. She's standing up for her boundaries. B says she's not in the wrong, which aligns with the scenario. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here. The author is justified in considering ending the relationship because respect is a fundamental part of any partnership. So, the answer should be B.\n"
