I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing anal sex with her boyfriend, who keeps pressuring her despite her clear boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author has communicated her boundary clearly\u2014she told him anal sex was a no-go. She even mentioned a past traumatic experience where her ex didn't stop when she asked. That's important because it shows she's not just being prudish; there's a valid reason for her refusal. \n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, is persistently pushing her, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" This sounds like he's dismissing her concerns and not respecting her boundary. The fact that he called her an asshole and called her a prude is also a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and pressuring someone into something they've explicitly said no to isn't okay.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary she's comfortable with. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because he's not respecting her limits, which can lead to coercion or even abuse. The user's initial thought that the author isn't in the wrong seems correct. The answer should be B.\n"
