I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend is pressuring the author to have anal sex, despite her clear boundaries and past trauma. \n\nFirst, the author communicated her refusal upfront when they started having sex. She mentioned anal was a no-go. Then he's persistently begging her even after she reiterates her stance. The boyfriend is dismissing her concerns, using phrases like \"you've never tried it with me\" and even calling her an asshole. The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, from a consent and communication standpoint, the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect for each other's limits. The fact that he's pressuring her after she said no repeatedly points to his behavior being problematic. The author is not the one at fault here; she's standing by her boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
