I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they refuse to have anal sex with their boyfriend. The boyfriend is described as kinky, while the author is vanilla and prudish. They had a conversation at the start where the author set a boundary against anal sex. The boyfriend, however, is pressuring the author, despite their clear refusal. The author mentions a past traumatic experience with anal sex where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when told. Now, the boyfriend is persistently trying to convince them, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author clearly stated their boundary, so the boyfriend pressuring them after that is problematic. Boundaries are important in any relationship, especially in sexual matters. The fact that the author has a past trauma related to anal sex adds another layer, indicating that this isn't just about preference but also about past negative experiences. The boyfriend's responses\u2014calling the author an asshole and a prude\u2014suggest a lack of respect for their boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author established a clear boundary. 2) The boyfriend is not respecting that boundary by continuing to pressure. 3) The author has tried to compromise, but the boyfriend refuses. 4) The author is considering ending the relationship due to this ongoing issue.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is essential. If one partner consistently disregards the other's boundaries, especially after they've been clearly communicated, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior indicates he's not respecting the author's autonomy and consent. The author isn't obligated to change their boundaries for the other person's satisfaction. \n\nSo, the answer here would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are upholding their boundaries, and the boyfriend is the one acting inappropriately by pressuring them.\n"
