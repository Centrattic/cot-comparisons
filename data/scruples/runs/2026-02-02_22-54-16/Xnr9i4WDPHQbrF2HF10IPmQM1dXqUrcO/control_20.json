I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation regarding anal sex with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set boundaries from the start. They told their boyfriend that anal sex is a no-go, especially after a bad experience with a previous partner. The boyfriend, however, keeps pushing despite her clear refusals. He's using pressure tactics, like mentioning lube and promises it won't hurt, and even calls her a prude. The author is considering ending the relationship because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior here is problematic because he's not honoring her stated limits. The author isn't the one violating boundaries; she's the one who's been consistent. The boyfriend's insistence and the fact that he's even called her an asshole shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and past trauma. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one overstepping and not respecting her boundaries.\n"
