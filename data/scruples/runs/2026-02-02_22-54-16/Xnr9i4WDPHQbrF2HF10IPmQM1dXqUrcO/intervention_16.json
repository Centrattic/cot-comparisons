I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. The situation is that they've been together for a year, she's vanilla and prudish, while he's into kinks. She explicitly told him anal was a no-go, and she even tried it once before with a previous partner, which was painful and the partner ignored her stop. Now her current boyfriend keeps pushing her, despite her clear boundaries, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" He's even called her a prude and an asshole, leading her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she's in the wrong. From what I know about healthy relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. She set a firm boundary, and he's not respecting it. Even if he's into kinks, non-consensual or pressured activities aren't okay. Her past experience where she was hurt and the partner didn't stop is a red flag, and her current boyfriend is ignoring her history and her stated limits. The fact that he's dismissing her feelings by calling her names suggests a lack of respect. \n\nCompromise is important, but it shouldn't involve pressuring someone to do something they've clearly said no to. She's willing to try other things but not anal. That's her right. The boyfriend isn't respecting her autonomy in this matter. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The main points are clear communication of boundaries, past trauma, and the partner's refusal to respect those boundaries. None of the boyfriend's actions here suggest healthy consent or respect, which are key in any relationship.\n"
