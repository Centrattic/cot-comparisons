I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink, but she's more vanilla. She clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go, especially after a bad experience. The boyfriend keeps pressuring her, even after she's set that boundary, and now he's being dismissive and even calling her names. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author made her boundary clear from the start. The boyfriend isn't respecting that, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should respect each other's limits. The fact that she's compromising on other things but he's not budging on this shows a lack of mutual respect from his side. \n\nThen there's the history she mentioned with a previous partner who didn't stop when she asked, which adds to her trauma. Her current boyfriend is aware of this. His continued pressure might be triggering her. Also, calling her names like \"asshole\" and labeling her as prude is not healthy communication.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which might be a good decision if he's not respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior seems manipulative and controlling. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and standing by it. The boyfriend is the one violating boundaries and not respecting her past experiences. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
