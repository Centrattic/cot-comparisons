I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary from the start, stating that anal sex is a no-go. They even mentioned a past experience where it hurt and the partner didn't stop when they asked. Now the boyfriend keeps pushing, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and even calling her a prude. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend is pressuring her to do something she's not comfortable with, despite her firm refusal. Pressuring someone into an activity they've explicitly said no to, especially after a traumatic experience, is a red flag. \n\nThe author isn't the one violating boundaries here. They've communicated their limits, and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. The fact that he's called her an asshole and continued to push suggests he's dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is inappropriate and potentially abusive. The correct answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
