I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving anal sex and a relationship. The author has a one-year relationship and is \"vanilla\" and prudish, while the boyfriend is kinky. The key points here are that the author has already set a clear boundary against anal sex, mentioned a past negative experience where it hurt and the partner didn't stop, and the current boyfriend is pressuring her despite her firm refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries in relationships. Consent is about mutual agreement without pressure. The author has communicated her limits, which is essential. The boyfriend is persistently asking and even using guilt or dismissive comments like calling her an asshole and accusing her of being prude. That's a red flag because respecting a partner's boundaries is fundamental. \n\nThe past experience where the previous partner didn't stop when she asked to is important. It shows a history of not respecting her limits, and now the current boyfriend is repeating similar behavior. The author is considering ending the relationship, which makes sense if the partner can't respect her no. \n\nCompromise is part of relationships, but only when it's within both partners' comfort zones. The boyfriend isn't compromising here; he's pushing against her established boundary. The fact that she's tried to find middle ground but he refuses means he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nCalling someone an asshole for not complying is a form of disrespect. Healthy relationships should foster mutual respect, not shame or pressure. The boyfriend's insistence and dismissive attitude suggest he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries, and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
