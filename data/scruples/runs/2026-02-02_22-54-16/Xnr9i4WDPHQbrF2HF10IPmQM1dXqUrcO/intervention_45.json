I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend. From the description, the author clearly communicated her boundary from the start. Her boyfriend is being persistent, even after she's said no multiple times, and is pressuring her. He's even called her names and dismissed her reasons.\n\nFirst, setting boundaries in a relationship is crucial. The author stated her refusal early on, which shows she's communicated her limits. The boyfriend isn't respecting that and is continuing to push, which is problematic. His behavior of not stopping when she says no and making excuses like \"it won't hurt\" ignores her past experience and current feelings. The fact that he's called her a prude and an asshole shows a lack of respect and empathy.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. Consent isn't something you can keep pushing for once it's been denied. The boyfriend's actions suggest he's not respecting her consent. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her boundaries. Her considering ending the relationship is a valid response to someone who doesn't respect her limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
