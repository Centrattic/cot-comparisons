I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author has clearly communicated their boundary to their boyfriend, stating they don't want to do anal sex. They mention a bad past experience where it hurt and the ex didn't stop when asked.\n\nNow, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her, even after she refused. He uses phrases like \"I promise it won't hurt\" and dismisses her concerns. He even called her an asshole and called her a prude. The author is thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author set a clear boundary, which the boyfriend isn't respecting. He's pressuring her into something she doesn't want, which is a form of coercion. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning because he's not accepting her refusal and is using manipulative tactics. The fact that he called her names adds insult to injury. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries without pressure or shaming. The boyfriend's actions here indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author is not in the wrong for setting that boundary and wanting to end the relationship if it's not honored. So the answer should be B.\n"
