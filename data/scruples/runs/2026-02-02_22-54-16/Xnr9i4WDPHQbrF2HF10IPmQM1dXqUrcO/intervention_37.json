I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have anal sex with their boyfriend. The situation involves a one-year relationship where the author is described as \"vanilla\" and the boyfriend as \"kinky.\" The author has a clear boundary: no anal sex. They mention a past experience where it was painful and the previous partner didn't stop when asked. Now the boyfriend is persistently pushing for it, using phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me.\" The author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author made their position clear from the start, so if the boyfriend is pressuring after that, he's in the wrong. The key points are that the author has a valid reason (past trauma) and has communicated their boundary. The boyfriend's response\u2014calling the author a prude and an asshole\u2014shows disrespect. The persistence despite the author's refusal is a red flag. In healthy relationships, partners respect each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend can't accept that, the issue lies with him. The author isn't wrong for upholding their limits. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
