I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation where they refuse anal sex with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The couple has been together for a year. The author is described as \"vanilla\" and \"prudish,\" while the boyfriend is \"kinky.\" When they first started having sex, the boyfriend asked about boundaries, and the author clearly stated that anal sex is a no-go. The author had a bad experience with a previous partner where anal sex was painful and the partner didn't stop when asked.\n\nNow, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try anal sex, even after she's stated it's a firm no. He uses phrases like \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\" and \"you've never tried it with me,\" which the author finds dismissive because she's already explained her reasons. He even called her a prude and an asshole, which is pretty hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The author has communicated her boundaries clearly. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries and is pressuring her. Even if the author's reasons are personal or past experiences, that doesn't make her wrong for setting those limits. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistent pressure and disrespecting her no\u2014is problematic.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. Pressuring someone to engage in sexual acts they've refused is a violation of their autonomy. The author's consideration of ending the relationship seems justified given the disrespect shown by the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Her boundaries are valid, and the boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
