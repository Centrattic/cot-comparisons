I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's into kink. She's told him she doesn't want anal sex, has a bad history with it where it hurt and the previous partner didn't stop when she asked. Now her current boyfriend keeps pressuring her, saying things like it's okay with lube or that she hasn't tried it with him. She's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think the key points here are consent, respecting boundaries, and the boyfriend's behavior. The author clearly set a boundary when they started, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. Pressuring someone after they've said no is a red flag. Also, her past experience with anal sex was negative, which adds to her trauma or discomfort. The boyfriend's comments like calling her an asshole and questioning her prudishness are dismissive and not supportive. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. If someone keeps pushing a partner on a firm no, that's not okay. The author isn't in the wrong for setting her boundaries and standing by them. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her limits, which is a big issue. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
