I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about anal sex. The author is a woman in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend who's described as kinky. She's more vanilla and prudish. When they started dating, he asked about boundaries, and she clearly stated anal was a no-go. She had a bad experience with a previous partner where anal sex was forced despite her asking to stop. Now the boyfriend keeps pressuring her to try it again with him, using various arguments and even calling her names like \"asshole.\" She's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess consent and boundaries. The key points here are that she set a clear boundary and he's not respecting it. In healthy relationships, consent is crucial. If someone sets a boundary and the other person continues to push, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014persistently begging, making excuses, and even being disrespectful\u2014suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she has a past trauma related to this makes it even more concerning because he's not being sensitive to her history.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, calling her a prude and an asshole, shows a lack of respect and empathy. Healthy communication should involve listening to each other's boundaries without coercion. The author's refusal isn't just about personal preference; it's about safety and past trauma. The boyfriend's pressure could be emotional manipulation, which is unhealthy. The author considering ending the relationship is a valid response when someone doesn't respect her boundaries.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether her refusal is unreasonable. Since she communicated her boundaries clearly and the boyfriend is pressuring her despite that, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
