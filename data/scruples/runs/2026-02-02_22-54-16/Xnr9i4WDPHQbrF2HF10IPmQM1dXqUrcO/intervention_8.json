I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about refusing to have anal sex with a boyfriend despite his persistent requests. The author has a history where a previous partner forced anal sex without stopping when she asked, which makes her uncomfortable. She's clearly communicated her boundaries, but the boyfriend keeps pushing and even called her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries in relationships. The author has stated her limits, which is anal sex. The boyfriend, however, isn't respecting that and is pressuring her. In healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If someone is pressuring or badgering their partner into doing something they've said no to, that's a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014persistently asking, dismissing her concerns, and even using derogatory language like \"asshole\"\u2014suggest a lack of respect for her autonomy. The fact that she has a past trauma related to anal sex adds another layer. It's important that a partner doesn't push someone to do something that triggers past negative experiences.\n\nCompromise is part of relationships, but it shouldn't involve violating someone's clear boundaries. The author has tried to find middle ground but the boyfriend isn't willing to accept her limits. The boyfriend's arguments about lube and technique don't account for her personal refusal based on both preference and past trauma.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for setting her boundaries. The issue lies with the boyfriend not respecting those boundaries. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
