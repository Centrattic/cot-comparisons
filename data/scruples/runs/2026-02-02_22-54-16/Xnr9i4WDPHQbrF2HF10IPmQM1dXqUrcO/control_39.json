I'm very 'vanilla' and prudish. My boyfriend is, to be frank, kinky. When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. So Reddit, who's the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting to have anal sex with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the backstory: She's been with her boyfriend for a year. She's described as \"vanilla\" and prudish, while he's into kink. When they started having sex, she clearly set a boundary against anal sex. She had a bad experience with it before, where it hurt and the partner ignored her when she asked to stop. Now, the boyfriend keeps pressuring her, saying things like it doesn't hurt if you use lube, begging, and even calling her a prude and an asshole. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. She made it clear that anal sex is a no-go for her, which is a personal boundary. The boyfriend isn't respecting that and is pressuring her despite her firm no. In healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries without coercion or pressure. The boyfriend's behavior of not stopping and even mocking her (calling her names) is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her limits and is standing by them. The boyfriend is the one who's violating her consent by continuing to push for something she's declined. Even though her boyfriend might have different desires, that doesn't justify pressuring or disrespecting her boundaries. The question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to comply. The answer would be no; she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
