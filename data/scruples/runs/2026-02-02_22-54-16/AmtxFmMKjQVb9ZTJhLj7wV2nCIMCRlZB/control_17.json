I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family who uses his money to attract girls by posting expensive stuff on Instagram. He says he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. He's changed his behavior to show off his wealth, and when he told a friend about this tactic, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Using money to attract others can be seen as using materialism as a tool for personal gain, which some might find superficial or manipulative. The author is being honest with himself that he's doing this to \"get with girls,\" which implies he's not being genuine in his interactions. But he also mentions that he's a different person with his friends, not showing off his wealth, so maybe he's being authentic in some contexts but not others.\n\nThen there's the question of whether this is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's not his fault for trying to leverage what he has to improve his social life, especially if he's confident and happy with his approach. Others might say that it's inconsiderate or objectifying if the girls are only interested in his money, which could lead to insincere relationships. Also, the fact that his friend was shocked and called him an asshole suggests that his peers don't approve of this method.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the girls. If the girls are genuinely interested in him despite his wealth, maybe it's their choice. But if they're only interested because of his money, then the relationships might not be genuine. However, the author doesn't mention that the girls are aware of his strategy or their motivations, so it's unclear. Additionally, the author is helping his friends pay for tuition, showing he has a good side too.\n\nThe key points are: Is using wealth to attract others unethical? Does it make him a douche? The friend's reaction indicates a social disapproval, but the author doesn't see himself as the asshole. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. Some might say it's his way of navigating social challenges, while others might find it inauthentic and manipulative. \n\nSince the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on ethical standards. If deception or inauthenticity is considered wrong, then A. If it's just a strategy and not harming anyone, then B. The fact that he's being honest with himself but not with others (he's not hiding his wealth, just using it strategically) complicates things. The friend's judgment implies societal disapproval, but the author doesn't claim to be deceitful beyond his methods. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a gray area, but leaning towards A because using wealth as a tool for social status in relationships can be seen as unethical or manipulative, even if there's no direct harm mentioned.\n"
