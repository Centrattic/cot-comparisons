I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his money on social media, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He's also helping his friends pay tuition and acts normally with them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants opinions. I need to decide if A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong) is the answer. \n\nFirst, consider the actions: using wealth to attract others. Is that inherently wrong? People use various tactics to attract attention, like appearance, confidence, or interests. Using money isn't illegal, but some might see it as inauthentic or manipulative. The author is honest with his friends, but maybe not upfront with the girls. The key is intent. If he's not lying directly but using his status as an advantage, some might argue it's just self-promotion. Others might see it as exploiting his wealth to gain attention, which could be seen as shallow or using others for his benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't harming anyone physically. He's being open with his friends and is generous with his resources towards them. The friend's reaction was shock, but that's her opinion. The ethical issue here is more about personal values. If the author feels he's being genuine in his interactions and isn't misleading the girls beyond showing off what he has, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if he's using his wealth as a tool to manipulate or deceive for sexual attention, that could be seen as morally questionable.\n\nAnother angle: the girls who DM him might be interested in his money, but the author's intent is to use his wealth to attract them. It's a mutual exchange of interest. But maybe the problem is that he's prioritizing his goals without considering the girls' perspectives. If he's not being honest about his intentions or theirs, that's a red flag. However, if they're both aware and it's a mutual attraction based on his lifestyle, maybe not.\n\nThe friend's judgment is based on her values, but that doesn't make the author wrong. People have different standards. The author isn't violating laws, so it's more about social morality. The line is blurry here. Some might say it's a personal choice and not the author's fault, while others might see it as inauthentic. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and there's no legal wrongdoing, it's more subjective. But if the author is honest and not lying, just using his resources, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, using wealth as a tool to manipulate others' affections could be seen as unethical. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the tactics are considered deceptive. If he's not lying about his intentions or his background, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's leading girls on with the expectation of a relationship while using money as bait, that's a problem. The author mentions he's a different person with friends, which suggests he's aware of the duality but chooses to act differently in different contexts. That's common, but doesn't make it right or wrong. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B (not wrong) because there's no clear ethical violation beyond social judgment. However, others might argue it's still a form of manipulation. Considering the AITA context, the community often leans towards actions that are dishonest or harmful as being wrong. If the author isn't being deceptive, he's not in the wrong. But if the act of using wealth to attract is considered inherently manipulative, then A. The question is whether using wealth in this way is acceptable. Since it's a personal choice and not illegal, I'd say he's not in the wrong, so B.\n"
