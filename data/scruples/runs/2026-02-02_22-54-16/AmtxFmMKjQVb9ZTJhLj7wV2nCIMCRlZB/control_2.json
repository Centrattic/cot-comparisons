I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. He uses his Instagram to showcase his wealth\u2014condo, cars, trips\u2014which gets him more followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also changes his behavior when talking to them, focusing on his dad's business and his future role. However, when he's with his non-wealthy friends, he's more laid-back and even helps pay their tuition.\n\nThe friend found out and called him a douche. The author is now asking if he's at fault. The question is whether using money to attract partners is wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using wealth to attract someone can be seen as superficial or transactional. If the author is being inauthentic, presenting a different persona to appeal to others, that might be problematic. Relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and genuine connection, not materialism. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that people present their best selves in dating contexts. The author isn't necessarily lying about his wealth; he's highlighting aspects of his life that he can. The issue is whether he's being deceptive about his intentions. He says he does this \"only to get with girls,\" which suggests he's not being entirely authentic. If the girls are responding to his wealth and not his true self, then the relationships might be based on false premises. \n\nAdditionally, the author's behavior with friends shows he's willing to be genuine and helpful, which contrasts with his approach to dating. This duality might indicate a lack of self-awareness or integrity. The friend's reaction supports the idea that this behavior is frowned upon, as it can come off as manipulative or using others for material gain. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not inherently wrong to use one's assets to attract partners, especially if one is being honest about their wealth. However, the key here is the intention to deceive by curating a specific image. The author is consciously changing his behavior and environment to appear more attractive, which could be seen as insincere. \n\nAnother angle: is the author being honest about his intentions? If he's only interested in getting dates through wealth, but the girls might not be aware of that, then he's not being transparent. However, if the girls are equally into the lifestyle and are aware of his wealth, maybe it's mutual. The problem arises if there's a lack of authenticity, which can lead to superficial relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while using wealth isn't inherently wrong, the author's approach of being inauthentic and manipulative to achieve his goals does make him at fault. The act of presenting a curated image solely to attract partners, without genuine intent to build real connections, is ethically questionable.\n"
