I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his money on social media, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He's open with his friends about this strategy, even after one friend told him he was an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using money to attract romantic partners can be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. It might imply that the person isn't interested in genuine connections but rather in the status or material benefits. The author admits he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls otherwise, so he's using his wealth as a compensatory strategy. But is that wrong? It's a form of self-promotion, similar to how people might use their skills or personalities to attract others. However, the line might be crossed when it's purely transactional or when it's done deceptively. The author is upfront with his friends about his tactics, so there's no deception there. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that she finds the approach morally wrong. But others might see it as a personal choice. The question is whether the author is violating some social norm or ethical standard. If the girls he interacts with are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for his money, that's their choice. However, if he's being deceptive about his intentions or the extent of his wealth, that could be a problem. The author mentions he's a different person when with his non-wealthy friends, which might indicate a level of inauthenticity, but that's not necessarily wrong if it's just adapting to different social contexts.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The author helps his friends pay tuition, which shows he's not entirely self-serving. However, using money to get attention in dating could be seen as exploiting his privilege. The key issue is whether the author's actions are hurting others. If the girls he's attracting are aware of his wealth and choose to be with him for that reason, it's a mutual decision. But if he's leading them on or not being transparent, that's a problem. The author doesn't mention deception, so it's unclear. \n\nIn social norms, there's a stigma around using money to attract partners, often labeled as \"trophy\" relationships. However, people do use various means to attract partners, and it's subjective whether this is wrong. The author's approach might be considered shallow, but it's not illegal. The friend's judgment is a personal opinion, but it doesn't necessarily make the author the asshole. The AITA community often considers intent and harm. If the author isn't causing direct harm and is honest about his tactics, some might say he's not in the wrong. Others might argue it's unethical to prioritize material wealth in relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on the ethical perspective. If the author is honest and the other party is aware, it's a personal choice. However, if it's seen as manipulative or deceptive, then he might be in the wrong. The scenario doesn't confirm deception, so leaning towards B (not in the wrong) based on lack of harm and personal choice.\n"
