I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family uses his money to attract women by showcasing his wealth on social media and in person. He's honest with his friends about this strategy, but one friend calls him an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author is using his resources to attract attention, which isn't inherently wrong, but the method might involve manipulation. He's presenting a curated image of himself to impress others, which could be seen as deceptive. However, he's upfront with his friends and doesn't hide his intentions. \n\nThe key points are: using social media to display wealth, being strategic in his appearance and locations, and being honest about his approach with friends. The friend's reaction suggests that his actions cross a line, but others might see it as a personal choice in dating. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. Using money to attract partners isn't illegal, but it can be viewed as inauthentic or objectifying others. The author's dual behavior (different personas with friends vs. dates) might indicate insincerity. However, everyone has different standards for what's acceptable in dating, so whether it's wrong depends on perspectives.\n\nI should consider societal norms and the potential harm. If the women are aware of his intentions and choose to engage, it's consensual. But if he's misleading them, that's a problem. The author claims he's honest when necessary, but the presentation might still be misleading. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often judges based on honesty and respect. The author isn't lying directly, but he's using a strategy that could be seen as manipulative. The fact that a friend labeled him an asshole adds to the complexity, but friends' opinions can be subjective.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not deceiving people and is honest about his intentions, maybe not. But using wealth to gain attention could be seen as exploiting his resources, which some might consider unethical. It's a matter of perspective, but in AITA terms, the community often sides against strategies that are seen as manipulative even if they're not illegal. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a consensus on this.\n"
