I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund, not good-looking, and struggling to get with girls. He started using Instagram to showcase his wealth\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he got DMs from girls. He dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business. He's upfront with friends, pays their tuition, and acts normally around them. However, when he told a friend about his tactics, she was shocked and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is curious for my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using money to attract people could be seen as manipulative. The author is leveraging his wealth to compensate for lack of physical appearance, which might be a form of inauthentic interaction. But is it inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's his way of navigating the dating scene, and as long as he's honest about his intentions, it's his choice. Others might see it as exploiting his wealth to gain an unfair advantage, which could be considered inconsiderate or objectifying others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just strategically presenting it. He's not coercing anyone, just using social media to attract attention. Additionally, he supports his friends financially, suggesting he's not a selfish person. The friend's reaction was negative, but that's just one person's opinion. \n\nHowever, the key issue is whether using wealth in this context is ethically wrong. If the author is being honest about his approach and isn't misleading others, maybe it's his strategy. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not just to attract partners, that's a different matter. The line between authentic and manipulative behavior can be blurry. Since the author is upfront with his friends and is helping others, it might mitigate some of the \"wrongdoing.\" \n\nBut in the dating context, if he's using material displays to attract girls without genuine connection, that could be seen as superficial. The question is whether it's acceptable to use wealth as a tool in dating. Different people have different values here. If one person is using their resources to gain social capital, is that inherently wrong? It's a gray area. \n\nConsidering the friend's shock and the label of \"asshole,\" society might frown upon this approach. But the author isn't causing direct harm beyond the girls' potential realization that he's using money. However, if the girls consent to the relationship knowing his wealth is a factor, then it's their choice. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a matter of perspective. Some might see it as inauthentic but not wrong, while others might view it as exploitative. The author is using his resources, which he has access to, to achieve his goals. If he's not harming anyone and being honest, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's manipulating perception, it could be considered wrong. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I need to decide if his actions cross an ethical line. I think it's a bit of both, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not lying and is using his own resources, even if it's inauthentic.\n"
