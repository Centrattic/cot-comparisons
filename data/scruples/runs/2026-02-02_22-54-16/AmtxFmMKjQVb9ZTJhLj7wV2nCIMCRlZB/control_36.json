I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his lifestyle on social media and in person. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls, so he changed his approach by flaunting his wealth through his Instagram posts\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from women. He dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress. He admits he's only doing this to get with girls but acts normally around his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and using a Honda with them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative. It's about using material things as a tool rather than genuine connection. However, in the realm of dating, people often present themselves in ways that are advantageous. The line is blurry here. He's not lying about his wealth, just emphasizing it. But the intention to use it solely for attraction might be considered inauthentic. On the other hand, if he's honest about his intentions and the women are aware (since they're responding to his posts), maybe it's a mutual game. However, when he spilled the beans to his friend, her reaction suggests she viewed it as deceptive or shallow, which could imply that his method is seen as unethical by others. Also, treating people differently based on their financial status could be a point against him. But there's no mention of the women being deceived about his intentions once they meet him. It's possible he's transparent in person. Still, using social media as a tool to attract people with wealth might be seen as exploiting materialism. The key factors here are honesty in interactions and the authenticity of the connections. If he's upfront, maybe it's not his fault, but the method of using wealth as a lure could be problematic. The friend's reaction indicates societal judgment against such tactics. So, weighing these points, the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong because it's about using wealth as a primary tool for attraction, which can be seen as shallow and manipulative, even if it's not illegal or overtly harmful. The ethical issue here is about authenticity in relationships. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
