I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old wealthy individual who uses their money and social media to attract girls. They post about their luxury items, go to trendy places, and talk about their dad's business to impress women. They also mention helping friends pay tuition but acting differently around them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue here is whether using financial status to attract romantic interest is wrong. The author admits to being a \"douche\" only when trying to get girls, which suggests they're being inauthentic. The friend's reaction is that they're an asshole, which adds a social perspective.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative or insincere. Relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and genuine connection, not on material displays. However, the author isn't lying about their wealth\u2014it's a fact. But they are leveraging it strategically to gain attention, which could be considered shallow or self-centered.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The author's actions might make them feel that their worth is tied to material possessions, which isn't healthy. Also, the friend's shock indicates that the author's behavior is perceived negatively by those close to them, suggesting a breach of trust when they revealed the strategy.\n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily lying about who they are. They are using their resources, which they legally own, to enhance their social standing. But the method of using wealth to attract partners could be seen as transactional. The key here is the intent: if the goal is to build genuine relationships, using wealth as a tool might undermine that.\n\nAlso, the author helps friends financially, showing they have a different side. But that doesn't negate the behavior in question. People can have multiple facets, but the issue remains about the approach to dating.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that wealth can be a confidence booster, using it as the primary means to attract partners can be viewed as shallow. Authenticity is often valued in relationships, and the author's method seems to lack that.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is being inauthentic and possibly manipulative, which could be seen as being in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
