I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old with a wealthy background, a trust fund kid. They mention not being good-looking and having trouble getting girls, so they decided to use their wealth to attract attention. They post expensive items like condos, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram, which increased their followers and resulted in DMs from girls. They've been doing this for a year, dressing better, using their nicer car, going to trendy places, and talking about their dad's business. They admit they come off as a douche but only do this to get girls. Otherwise, they act normally with friends who aren't wealthy, even helping pay their tuition and driving a Honda with them. Recently, they told a friend about their strategy, and she called them an asshole/douche.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here are: using wealth to attract girls, being deceptive or inauthentic, and the impact on others.\n\nFirst, using money to attract people isn't inherently wrong. Many people use their resources to enhance their social life or dating prospects. However, the question is about the ethics of it. If someone is using their wealth to impress, that's a choice they make, but there's a line when it comes to deception or exploitation.\n\nThe author mentions they act differently when with friends versus when trying to attract girls. This dual identity could be seen as inauthentic. They present a wealthier, more luxurious image to attract attention, which might not reflect their true personality. But is that wrong? It depends on the intent. If the goal is to attract people solely based on materialism, some might see that as shallow.\n\nThen there's the act of helping friends pay tuition and being a different person with them. This shows they have genuine relationships outside their dating strategy, which might mitigate some criticism. However, when they told a friend about their strategy, the friend was shocked and called them an asshole. That reaction suggests that the friend found the approach manipulative or insincere.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are: 1) Using wealth to attract attention, 2) Presenting a false image, and 3) The friend's negative reaction.\n\nUsing wealth to attract dates isn't against the law, but it's a social judgment call. Some might view it as manipulative, others as a honest approach. However, if the author is being deceptive by not being upfront about their motives, that's different. The author isn't necessarily lying, but they are curating their image to highlight their wealth, which is a form of manipulation through social media presentation.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. If the author's method causes others to look down on them or feel that they're being insincere, there's a social consequence. The author's actions might be seen as exploiting their wealth for personal gain in dating, which some might condemn as inauthentic or shallow.\n\nHowever, the author does help their friends and has genuine relationships, which could balance the critique. The question is whether the method of using wealth to attract dates is ethically wrong. There's also the aspect of consent in the dating context. If the girls are choosing to engage with the author because they like his wealth, and he's not lying about his intentions, it's a matter of mutual agreement. But if the author is leading them on without genuine interest in forming real connections, that's a different angle.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily breaking any rules, but their approach is seen as inauthentic and possibly manipulative by some. The key here is whether using wealth to attract dates is considered wrong in the social context. The friend's reaction suggests that some people do find it objectionable. However, others might argue that it's a personal choice and there's nothing inherently wrong with using one's resources to enhance social opportunities. The line between self-promotion and manipulation is blurry here. The author's deception (if any) about their true intentions when interacting with girls is a critical point. If they're not being honest about their motives during dates, that would be problematic. But if they're just using their wealth to attract attention without misrepresenting themselves beyond that, it's a matter of opinion.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as inauthentic and potentially exploitative, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong. However, if the community (as in the AITA context) is divided, the answer might depend on cultural or societal norms. In many cases, people might feel that using wealth to attract dates is shallow but not unethical. Alternatively, if the author is being deceptive or leading others on, that's a different story. Since the author mentions they act differently with friends and only use wealth for dating, it's a form of inauthenticity that some would criticize. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their approach is seen as manipulative and insincere by others, even if it's not illegal.\n"
