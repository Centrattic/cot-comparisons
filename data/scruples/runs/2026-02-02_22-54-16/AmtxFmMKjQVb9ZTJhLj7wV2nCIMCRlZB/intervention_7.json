I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his financial status to gain social advantages, specifically in dating. Some might argue that this is manipulative or insincere, as he's not being genuine about his intentions. Others might say that it's his choice how he uses his resources and that people are free to present themselves in certain ways to attract others.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. She was shocked and called him an asshole, indicating that she sees this behavior as problematic. However, the author claims that he's a different person with his friends, helping them with tuition and not flaunting his wealth with them. This suggests that he's aware of his actions and their potential to be seen as inauthentic.\n\nI should also consider societal norms and values. There's a common critique about \"keeping up with the Joneses\" or using materialism to attract partners. Some might view this as superficial or as objectifying others, assuming that the women are only interested in his money. On the flip side, the author isn't forcing anyone; the women are responding voluntarily based on what they see. That could be seen as their own choice, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nAnother angle is the honesty in relationships. If the author is transparent about his motives and the women are okay with that, then it's a mutual decision. However, the scenario doesn't mention if he's being upfront from the start. The act of using social media to create a certain image might be misleading if it's not an accurate reflection of his everyday life. But again, people do curate their online personas, so maybe it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe friend's judgment is subjective. What one person sees as a douchebag move, another might see as smart strategy. The key here is whether the author is harming anyone. The women are initiating contact, and the author isn't explicitly lying about his character\u2014just his lifestyle. Unless he's deceptive about his intentions or making promises he can't keep, it might not be inherently wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize the author for being inauthentic or using materialism to attract others, others might argue it's his prerogative to use his resources as he sees fit. Since there's no explicit harm and the women are responding willingly, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
