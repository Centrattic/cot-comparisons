I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old male who's using his family's wealth to attract girls by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He's being honest with his friends about this tactic, but one friend called him an asshole for it. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract partners isn't inherently wrong, but there's a line when it comes to being deceptive. The guy is upfront about his intentions when approaching girls, but he's also being honest with his friends about his strategy. However, the main issue might be whether he's being deceptive during his interactions with the girls. If he's only using his wealth as a tool without hiding it, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not, that's different.\n\nAnother angle is the value of authenticity in relationships. If the girls are interested in him because of his wealth and not his genuine self, that could lead to issues. But the guy mentions he's a different person with his friends, showing he has a genuine side. However, using social media to project a certain image could be seen as inauthentic, even if he's not lying directly.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction might be influenced by their values. She might find it shallow or transactional, but others might not. The question is whether the act of using wealth as a tool for attraction is ethically wrong. It's not illegal, but it's a matter of social judgment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and whether harm is done. The guy isn't actively hurting anyone, but he's manipulating the perception of his wealth to attract attention. If the girls are aware of his status and choose to engage, maybe it's a mutual decision. However, if he's leading them on without genuine interest in a relationship, that's another problem. But the scenario doesn't mention any deceit about his intentions once he's interacting with the girls.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the man isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's being honest about his approach. But some might argue it's shallow or inauthentic, making it a matter of personal values. The friend's opinion is one perspective, but others might see it as a valid strategy. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and there's no direct harm or deceit mentioned, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because using wealth to attract partners can be seen as exploiting social status, which some might find unethical. But unless there's deception, it's a gray area. I think the answer is A, because using wealth to attract partners is often considered shallow and manipulative, even if it's not illegal. But the community might split on this. Alternatively, if he's being open about it, maybe it's not the wrong. Hmm.\n"
