I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls through social media and certain behaviors. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old man with a trust fund. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract women, so he started showcasing his wealth on Instagram\u2014posting his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he received DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car, and goes to trendy places where he talks about his dad's business and his future role in it. He admits this is just a tactic to get with girls, but he's a different person with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and using a more modest lifestyle.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are using wealth to attract attention, being deceptive, and the potential exploitation of others for personal gain.\n\nUsing money to attract partners isn't inherently wrong. People often use their assets, whether it's money, looks, or other traits, to enhance their social appeal. However, the issue might be in the intent and the honesty. The author is clear that he's using these tactics solely to \"get with girls,\" which suggests he's not being genuine in those interactions. He's presenting a curated image that might not reflect his true self. \n\nWhen he told his friend about his methods, she was shocked and called him an asshole. That reaction implies that she felt he was being inauthentic or manipulative. The problem arises when someone is being deceptive or treating others as means to an end without their consent. If the girls are being attracted by the wealth and not the person, and if there's no transparency about his motives, that could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girls are aware of his intentions and choose to engage with him anyway, then it's a mutual decision. However, the author doesn't mention that he's being upfront with the girls. He's using a strategy that's more about appearance than authenticity. \n\nAnother angle is the double standard. The author helps his friends financially and acts more modestly with them. But he uses his wealth to attract girls, which might be seen as exploiting his resources for personal gratification while being generous elsewhere. The inconsistency could be a point of criticism.\n\nEthically, the line is between using one's resources in a way that's honest versus manipulative. If he's not hiding his wealth but is using it to attract attention, it's still his choice. However, if he's creating a false persona, that's where the issue lies. The act of using money to attract partners isn't necessarily wrong, but the deception and lack of authenticity could make it problematic.\n\nConsidering societal norms, some might argue that using wealth to attract others is shallow or transactional. Others might say it's a legitimate strategy in the context of social dynamics. The friend's negative reaction supports the idea that the author's approach is seen as inauthentic or exploitative.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking laws, the ethical issue centers around honesty and authenticity. He's using his wealth strategically, but if he's not being genuine in his interactions with the girls, he might be in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the deceptive tactics and the manipulation of perception for personal gain.\n"
