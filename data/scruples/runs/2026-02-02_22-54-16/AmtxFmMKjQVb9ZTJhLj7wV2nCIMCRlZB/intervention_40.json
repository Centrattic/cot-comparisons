I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The guy is 22, from a wealthy family, using his money to attract girls by showing off his stuff on social media. He mentions dressing better, driving nicer cars, talking about his dad's business. He's helping his friends pay tuition but acts differently when he's with them, using a regular car and going to normal bars. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, answer A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The guy is using his wealth to attract attention from women, which is a common critique in dating circles. Is that inherently wrong? People can use different strategies to attract partners, and while some might view it as inauthentic or manipulative, others might see it as a personal choice. However, the key points here are his intent and the impact on others.\n\nHe's being honest with himself about his motives\u2014he's using money to get girls. There's no deception in the sense that he's not pretending to be someone else; he's leveraging his resources. But the problem arises when he shares his method with a friend, and she's upset. That suggests that his actions might be seen as disrespectful or objectifying, which could be a point against him. \n\nOn the other hand, he's also generous to his friends, helping with tuition. So there's a contrast between his public persona and private behavior. The inconsistency might be a red flag for some, but others might argue that people can have different sides to their lives. \n\nThe main ethical concern is whether using wealth to attract partners is wrong. It's not illegal, but it's a matter of social morality. Some would argue that it's fair game if both parties are aware and willing. However, if he's being deceptive or manipulating women's perceptions, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention deception, just using his resources to attract attention. \n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, which is a social judgment. But does that make him ethically in the wrong? It depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. If society deems using wealth in this way as unacceptable, then he might be in the wrong. However, others might say it's his choice as long as it's consensual and there's no harm. \n\nAnother angle is the double standard. Men using wealth to attract women is often criticized, while women using their looks or other assets is sometimes seen as normal. This could be a point of hypocrisy, but that's more about societal issues than the individual's actions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are morally questionable due to the potential for manipulation and exploitation. While he's being honest about his methods, the intent to use wealth as a tool for attraction could be seen as inauthentic and possibly exploitative. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
