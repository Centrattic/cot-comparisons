I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls, so he started using his wealth to do so. He posts his luxury items on Instagram, dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business. He's been doing this for a year and receives a lot of DMs from attractive girls. He mentions that he helps two friends pay their tuition and behaves differently with them, using a Honda and going to normal bars. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole or douche. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which is a form of materialism in relationships. Some people might view this as manipulative or insincere because he's leveraging his financial status rather than building genuine connections. However, others might argue that it's his choice how he uses his resources, and if he's honest about it and the women are aware of his wealth, then it's their choice to engage with him.\n\nThe key points here are intent and honesty. If the author is being upfront about his intentions and the women are aware of his wealth, then it's a mutual decision. However, if he's misleading the women by pretending to be someone he's not, that could be problematic. The author mentions that he only does this to get with girls, implying that his actions are strategic and not entirely genuine. But he also helps his friends, showing that he's not a bad person overall.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that using wealth to attract women is seen as exploitative or inconsiderate. However, whether that makes the author \"in the wrong\" depends on the perspective. In dating, there's no universal right or wrong, but societal norms often frown upon using materialism as a primary means of attraction. It can be seen as treating people as objects or commodifying relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being honest and the women are interested in his wealth, then it's a matter of mutual benefit. However, the author's admission that he's a \"huge douche\" and the fact that he only does this for dating could indicate a lack of authenticity, which might be ethically questionable. The line between being confident and being arrogant is thin here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions could be seen as unethical because he's using his wealth as a tool rather than building genuine connections. While he's not necessarily a bad person (as he helps his friends and behaves differently with them), his approach to dating is manipulative and could lead to shallow or transactional relationships. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
