I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a guy who's wealthy using his money to attract girls through social media. He posts about his condo, cars, etc., and gets a lot of DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives nicer cars, and talks about his dad's business to catch girls' eyes. Then he told a friend about his strategy, and she was shocked, calling him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The author is being honest with himself that he's only doing this to get with girls. He's using his wealth to attract attention, which could be seen as manipulative. But is that inherently wrong? People often use their assets to attract others, whether it's looks, money, or other traits. However, the line might be crossed if he's being deceptive. He mentions he's \"not good looking,\" so maybe he's compensating with wealth. \n\nHe also mentions that he's different with his friends, helping them pay tuition, driving a Honda, etc. So he's not living a double life entirely. But when he's trying to attract girls, he uses his wealth as a tool. The key point here is intent and honesty. If he's upfront with the girls about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But the problem is that he's using his wealth to gain an advantage, which some might see as inauthentic or exploiting his status.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of his friend. She called him an asshole, implying she finds his method unethical. But others might argue that it's a personal choice, and as long as no one is harmed, it's okay. The question is whether using money to attract partners is inherently wrong. \n\nThere's also the aspect of authenticity. If he's presenting a curated image online, that's common on social media. But if the girls are being drawn in by that image, and he's not being genuine, could that lead to issues in relationships? However, the story doesn't mention him being deceptive once a relationship starts. He's just using social media tactics to meet people. \n\nThe moral judgment here depends on cultural norms. Some might say it's fair game to use one's resources to attract others, while others see it as shallow or manipulative. The author isn't stealing or lying, just showcasing his wealth. But using wealth to attract partners can be seen as transactional, which some people dislike. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong is subjective. But since the question asks if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on ethical standards. If the action is considered using money as a tool to attract others without deception, it's not inherently wrong. However, if it's seen as exploiting his wealth to gain an unfair advantage in dating, then it could be considered wrong. Given that the author isn't lying about his wealth but is using it strategically, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But others might argue the intent is manipulative. I'm leaning towards B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
