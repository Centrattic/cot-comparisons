I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, uses social media to showcase their money, like posting about their condo, cars, and trips. This leads to getting DMs from girls. They also mention changing their behavior, like dressing better and driving nicer cars, specifically to catch girls' attention. They talk about their dad's business to impress them. However, when with friends who aren't wealthy, they act differently, using a Honda and going to student bars. A friend found out and called them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Is using wealth to attract others inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's just being honest about what one has, while others might see it as inauthentic or manipulative. The key here is the intent: the author admits they do this solely to get with girls, not because they genuinely like the lifestyle. That could be seen as insincere, which might be a problem in relationships.\n\nThe comparison between how the author presents themselves to different groups is important. They act differently depending on the audience, which could be seen as hypocrisy. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is viewed negatively by others, especially when they think it's deceptive. \n\nAnother angle is whether the girls involved are aware of the author's motivations. If the girls are into someone who is wealthy and the author is upfront about their wealth, maybe it's not deceitful. But if they're pretending to be a different person overall (like being humble when with friends but showing off when with others), that might be more problematic. However, the author doesn't explicitly say they lie to the girls about their intentions; they just use their wealth as a tool. \n\nThere's also the aspect of using social media strategically. Many people use social media to project an image, so is this different? It depends on the extent of the manipulation. If the author is just sharing parts of their life, it's common. But if they're curating a persona specifically to attract, that could be seen as gaming the system, which some might find unethical.\n\nAdditionally, the author helps friends pay for tuition and acts normally with them, which shows they have genuine aspects. However, the dual behavior might be seen as two-faced. The main issue is whether using wealth to attract partners is unethical. There's no legal wrongdoing, but socially, opinions might vary. Some might say it's okay to use your assets, while others argue it's superficial or objectifying the other person.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal views on authenticity and the ethics of using wealth for personal gain in relationships. The key points are the deceptive presentation versus honest self-promotion. The friend's negative reaction and the author's own admission of being a \"different person\" when with friends suggests that the behavior is seen as inauthentic and possibly exploitative, which could make the author at fault. So, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
