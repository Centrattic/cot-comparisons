I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a trust fund kid who's not considered good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. He's been using social media to showcase his luxury items, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. His friends aren't wealthy, and he helps them financially, but when he told one friend his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is being honest with his intentions\u2014using his money to attract women. But is that inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's manipulative or using someone for material reasons. Others might say it's just a different approach to dating, similar to how people might use charm, humor, or other traits.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She found out and was shocked, calling him an asshole. That suggests that in her view, it's unacceptable. But her judgment could be influenced by personal values or the idea that it's inauthentic. The author claims he's a different person with his friends, which might mean he's being genuine with them but not with the girls he's trying to attract. That duality could be seen as insincere or two-faced.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of using wealth in relationships. If someone is openly using their status to attract partners, it's not necessarily wrong unless it's deceptive. However, if the women he's attracting are only interested in his money and not his personality, that's a different issue, but the question is about the author's actions. He's being upfront about his tactics, even if it's not his true self when with his friends.\n\nThere's also the aspect of authenticity. If he's not being genuine in his interactions with the girls, that could be problematic. Relationships built on inauthenticity might lack true connection, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for his approach, not whether the relationships are healthy.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Ethically, it's more subjective. Some people might disapprove of using wealth to attract others, while others might see it as a personal strategy. The key here is whether the author's actions are considered morally wrong. The friend's reaction is a data point, but others might have different opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a personal choice. While it's unethical to some, it's not universally wrong. However, the consensus might lean towards AITA because using wealth to manipulate or attract others can be seen as inauthentic and possibly exploitative, even if it's not illegal. The friend's judgment supports that, but whether it's right or wrong is subjective. However, given the context and the typical AITA responses, the author might be considered in the wrong.\n"
