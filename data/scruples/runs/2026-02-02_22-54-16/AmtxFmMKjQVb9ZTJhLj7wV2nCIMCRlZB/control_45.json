I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family, part of a trust fund. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract women, so he started using his wealth to gain attention. He posts luxury stuff on Instagram, which increases his followers and gets DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress women. He mentions that he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and acting more normal. His friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider if using wealth to attract women is unethical. On one hand, people use various tactics to attract partners, and it's not inherently wrong to leverage what you have. On the other hand, it could be seen as being inauthentic or exploiting one's wealth to gain an advantage, which might be considered shallow or manipulative. The friend's reaction suggests that she finds it unethical, but others might have different opinions. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just being strategic. However, if he's being deceptive about his intentions or leading women on, that could be problematic. The key here is whether the method of using wealth is inherently wrong. Since the author is honest about his background when he chooses to, and it's not a lie, maybe it's not wrong. But some might argue it's using money to compensate for other shortcomings, which could be seen as a negative trait. So, the answer might depend on societal views on authenticity in relationships. The user is likely looking for a nuanced answer but the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author isn't lying and is just using his resources, but it's still a judgment call. The friend's reaction points to A, but others might say B. However, the common perspective in such AITA scenarios often leans towards it being a bit inconsiderate but not outright wrong. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user wants a strict A or B. The friend called him an asshole, which is a strong judgment. But maybe the community might split. I think the consensus here is that while it's not illegal or morally wrong, it's considered inauthentic and possibly a bit of a \"douche\" move, so AITA would be A. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check similar AITA posts. Typically, when someone uses a strategy to attract others, even if it's wealth, it's often seen as a bit of a \"douche\" move, hence AITA. So the answer is A.\n"
