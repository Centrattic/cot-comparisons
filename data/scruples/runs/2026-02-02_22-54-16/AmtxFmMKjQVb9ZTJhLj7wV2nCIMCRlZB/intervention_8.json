I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's genuine with his friends, helping them financially, and only uses his wealth for dating. A friend called him an asshole for being honest about his tactics.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: he's using his wealth strategically to attract attention from women, which he admits is a calculated move. He's open with his friends and supports them financially, but is upfront about his methods when he reveals them. The friend's reaction is negative, calling him a douche. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it wrong to use your wealth to attract others? Well, people often use various tactics to attract partners, like improving appearance, hobbies, or social status. Wealth is a resource, and using it is a personal choice. However, there's a line when it comes to honesty with potential partners. If he's being transparent about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's leading women on without genuine interest in them, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention deception. He's using his wealth openly, and if the women are interested because of that, it's their choice. He's not lying about his wealth but is upfront about his status. However, the act of using material possessions to attract others might be seen as superficial or transactional, which some might view as morally questionable. \n\nAlso, his friend's reaction is that he's an asshole for being honest. The friend's judgment is based on the perception that he's being disingenuous or manipulative. The question is whether the method of attraction is inherently wrong. If it's about mutual consent and the women are aware of his situation, then it's their choice to engage. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not to get dates, that's different. The scenario says he's being himself when he's not with the girls, so maybe he's not faking it entirely. \n\nAnother angle: the person is being honest with his friends, which shows integrity in that relationship. However, using wealth to attract others could be seen as exploiting one's privilege. Some might argue that it's not wrong because it's a personal strategy, while others might see it as inauthentic or objectifying. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often criticize those who \"buy\" attention, but it's a personal choice. Unless there's harm involved, like emotional manipulation or deceit, it's a matter of opinion. Since the story doesn't indicate that the women are being deceived or harmed, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. However, the friend's reaction highlights societal disapproval of using wealth for such purposes. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using wealth strategically is considered morally wrong. If the user's friend is judgmental, that's their opinion, but the person isn't violating any laws or explicitly harming others. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that it's superficial. Given the context, the answer could be B, he's not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced question.\n"
