I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. So, they're a 22-year-old trust fund kid who isn't good-looking and found it hard to get dates. They started posting their wealth on Instagram\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips\u2014and their followers and DMs from \"hot girls\" increased. They dress better, take their nicer car out, go to trendy places, and talk about their dad's business. They mention they only do this to meet girls, but when they tell a friend, the friend calls them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is morally wrong. Let's break it down. The person is using their wealth as a strategy to attract romantic partners. Is manipulating one's image to attract others inherently wrong? People often present their best selves in dating situations, whether it's through social media or in person. However, the key here is the intent and the method. The author is being upfront about their wealth, but are they being deceptive? They mention they act differently when with friends, using a Honda instead of their nicer car, so maybe they are genuine in those interactions. But when trying to meet girls, they're more focused on showcasing wealth.\n\nBut is it ethical to use wealth as a primary tool for attraction? Some might argue that it's just a personal strategy and not inherently wrong. Others might see it as objectifying others or using materialism to gain attention. The friend's reaction is that the author is an asshole, but that's a subjective opinion. The question is whether the actions themselves are wrong, not if the friend's judgment is correct.\n\nAlso, the author helps friends pay for tuition, which shows they have a charitable side. However, the act of using wealth to attract partners isn't necessarily about being a bad person but about personal strategy. The problem might be if they're being deceptive about their intentions. For example, if they pretend to be someone they're not, but the author seems to be using their actual wealth. However, the line between being oneself and using a strategy is blurry. \n\nAnother angle: are they manipulating others' desires? Social media is a space where people showcase curated lives. The author is capitalizing on that. But is it wrong to use one's resources to attract dates? It's not illegal or unethical in a strict sense. However, it could be seen as inauthentic or shallow. The friend's reaction is important, but that's just one person's opinion. The broader question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong, not just that their friend is upset.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they're using their resources to attract partners, which is a personal choice. However, some might argue that it's superficial or manipulative, but unless there's deception, it's hard to say it's wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
