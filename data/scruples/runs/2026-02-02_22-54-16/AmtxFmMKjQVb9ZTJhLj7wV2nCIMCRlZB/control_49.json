I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. So, the person is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, part of a trust fund. They mention that they're not good-looking and have trouble getting girls, so they started showcasing their wealth on Instagram\u2014posting their condo, cars, watches, trips. Their followers increased, and they got a lot of DMs from \"hot girls.\" They've been doing this for a year, dressing better, driving their nicer car to catch attention. They talk about their dad's business and how they're going to join next year. They say they know they sound like a douche but only do this to get with girls. They also help two friends pay tuition, act normally with them, drive a Honda, go to student bars. Then they told a friend their secret, and the friend called them an asshole.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider if using money to attract romantic partners is unethical. Some people might argue that it's manipulative or insincere because it's using material things rather than genuine connection. Others might say that if both parties are aware and consenting, it's not wrong. However, the author is being upfront about their intentions on social media, but when they interact with the girls, are they being honest? The author says they \"only do this to get with girls,\" implying that their primary motive is to attract them through wealth. \n\nThere's a difference between showing off wealth and using it as a tool for manipulation. If the girls are being attracted by the posts and then the author is being genuine in person, maybe it's a gray area. But the friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions are seen as inauthentic or exploitative. The friend called them an \"asshole/douche,\" which indicates a negative social judgment. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior might be considered a form of \"bling dating,\" where wealth is used to attract partners. This can be seen as shallow or transactional. Even though the author helps friends with tuition and acts normally with them, the fact that they admit to changing their behavior specifically to attract girls could be seen as hypocritical or dishonest. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't lying about their wealth; they are simply highlighting it. There's no indication they're lying to the girls they date. However, the intent is to use their wealth as a tool, which might not be respectful to the girls who may be attracted more to the material aspects than the person. \n\nAnother angle is consent. If the girls are aware of the author's wealth and are attracted to it, then maybe it's a mutual agreement. But the author's method involves deception in the sense that they're presenting a curated image that's different from their everyday self. Even if they are genuine when they meet up, the initial attraction was based on manipulated social media presence. \n\nThe key issue here is whether using one's resources to attract partners is unethical. It's a matter of perspective. Some might say it's their right to use their money, while others see it as exploiting others' material desires. The friend's reaction and the general social judgment (as implied by the \"AITA\" question) suggest that many people would side with A, that the author is in the wrong. \n\nAdditionally, the author's admission that they \"know I sound like a huge douche\" indicates some self-awareness of the unpopularity of their actions. The fact that they had to \"spill the beans\" to a friend and got a negative reaction supports the idea that their actions are seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's no definitive right answer, the social norms and the friend's judgment lean towards the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
