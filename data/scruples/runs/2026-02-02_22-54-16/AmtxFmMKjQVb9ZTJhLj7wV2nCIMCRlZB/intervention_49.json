I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family who uses his money to attract girls on social media. He posts about his condo, cars, watches, and trips, which gets him DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also mentions that he acts a certain way to catch girls' attention, like talking about his dad's business and using his nicer car. When he told a friend, she was shocked and called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's accurate. First, let's consider the ethics here. The author is using his wealth to attract attention, which some might see as manipulative or inauthentic. But others might say that people use their assets to attract others, and it's not inherently wrong. He's also being a different person when with friends, which shows he's aware of his behavior's duality.\n\nHowever, the key issue is whether using money to get girls is unethical. If he's being transparent about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's misleading others by pretending to be someone he's not, that's a problem. The friend's reaction indicates that she found it inauthentic and possibly deceptive. The author's actions could be seen as exploiting his wealth to manipulate others' perceptions, which could be considered unethical. On the other hand, everyone has different ways to attract partners, and using one's resources isn't necessarily wrong if it's not harming others. But the deceit aspect might tip the balance. If he's presenting a false image to get dates, that's where the problem lies. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions are deceptive and manipulative even if they don't directly harm others.\n"
