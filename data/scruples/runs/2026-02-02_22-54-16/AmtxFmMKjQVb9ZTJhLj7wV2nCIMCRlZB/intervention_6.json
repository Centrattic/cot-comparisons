I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media and in person. He mentions that while he's not good-looking, he's using his money to get attention. He also helps his friends financially but keeps a lower profile when with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The man isn't lying about his wealth; he's being honest about his financial status. However, he's using his wealth as a primary tool to attract women, which some might see as superficial or materialistic. The friend's reaction was to call him an asshole, indicating that there's a social judgment here. \n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, the question is whether he's manipulating or deceiving. The scenario states that he's upfront about his intentions and his wealth. He's not pretending to be someone else, just leveraging his resources. On the other hand, if someone feels they're being used or if the women are only interested because of his money, that could be a problem. \n\nHowever, the women who approach him are doing so of their own volition, responding to his posts and engaging with him. There's no indication he's coercing or tricking them. He's being honest about his tactics with his friends, which could be seen as a positive, but his friend's negative reaction shows that some people might disapprove of his approach. \n\nThe key points are honesty, consent, and the intention to attract through wealth. While some might criticize the method as shallow, unless there's deception or harm involved, it's a matter of personal choice. Since he's not causing direct harm and the women are choosing to engage, it might not be his fault. However, the ethical judgment can be subjective here. Some argue that using wealth to attract partners is inherently problematic because it reduces the value of genuine connection. Others might say it's a valid strategy in a competitive dating market. \n\nGiven that there's no coercion or lying, and the actions are consensual between the individuals involved, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's judgment is based on personal values, but unless there's a violation of ethical standards, the answer leans towards B.\n"
