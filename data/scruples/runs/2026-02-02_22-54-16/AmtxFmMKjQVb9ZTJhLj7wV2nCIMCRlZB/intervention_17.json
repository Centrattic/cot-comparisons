I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The guy is using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and in person. He's also being a different person when with his friends, helping them financially. His friend called him an asshole after he revealed his tactics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered ethical or respectful in dating. Using money to attract partners can be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The question is whether it's wrong to use wealth as a tool for romantic attention. Some might argue that everyone uses their strengths, and if his wealth is his strength, then it's fair game. Others might say it's exploitative because it's not genuine and could lead to relationships based on materialism rather than mutual respect.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. He's being upfront with the girls about his wealth, but is he being honest about his intentions? If he's only interested in them because of their reaction to his money, that could be a problem. Also, the fact that he's different when with his friends versus when he's trying to attract girls might indicate a lack of authenticity in general.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She thinks he's an asshole, which suggests that his behavior might be seen as deceptive or self-serving. But he does help his friends financially, showing he's not entirely selfish. However, his actions in the dating scene could still be problematic.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In some contexts, showing off wealth is common and accepted, while in others, it's frowned upon. The key here is whether the method of using wealth is considered respectful. If the girls are interested because they value his wealth, then it's a mutual thing, but if they're being manipulated without knowing, that's different.\n\nUltimately, the question is whether the ends justify the means. If he's getting what he wants without harming anyone, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using people or being deceptive, then he is. The answer hinges on whether his actions are seen as manipulative or just strategic use of his resources.\n"
