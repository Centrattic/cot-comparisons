I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The guy is 22, from a wealthy family, and he's using his money to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media. He's been doing this for a year, dressing nicer, showing off his car and trips, and talking about his dad's business. His friends aren't wealthy, and he helps them with tuition, but when he's with them, he drives a Honda and goes to normal places. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him a douche. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract people can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. The guy is being upfront with himself about his intentions, but is it wrong to use his resources to get attention? Some might argue that it's his money and he's free to use it as he sees fit. Others might say it's using others for his own gain, which is exploitative.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. He's being honest with himself but perhaps not with the girls he's interacting with. If he's only interested in them because of their attraction and using his wealth as a lure, is he being genuine? Relationships built on such foundations might be seen as shallow, which could be disrespectful to the other person's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. The guy helps his friends financially but hides his wealth from them, presenting a different image. When he reveals his strategy, they're shocked. This inconsistency might be a problem. Hypocrisy can damage trust and relationships, even if his intentions with the girls are solely romantic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point to consider. She called him an asshole, which suggests her perspective is that his actions are inconsiderate or unethical. While her judgment might be harsh, her reaction indicates that his behavior is seen negatively by others close to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy isn't forcing anyone; the girls initiate contact. If they're aware of his wealth and still choose to engage, it's a mutual decision. However, if he's not transparent about his motives, that's where the issue lies. The key here is consent and honesty in interactions.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using his money to attract girls while being in a different social context with friends shows a split in his identity. This duality might be a way to avoid confrontation but could lead to inauthentic relationships. The problem isn't necessarily the use of money but the lack of transparency and the potential for insincerity.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's not illegal or necessarily against social norms to use one's wealth to attract others, the ethical consideration revolves around honesty and respect. The author is being inauthentic in his approach, using a different persona to achieve his goals, which could be seen as manipulative. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he's not being genuine and is potentially leading others on with ulterior motives.\n"
