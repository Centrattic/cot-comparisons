I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a trust fund kid who's not good-looking and had trouble getting dates. He started showcasing his wealth on social media, which led to more DMs from girls. He dresses better, uses his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business to impress women. His friends, who aren't wealthy, see him as a different person\u2014more normal with them. He told one friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using money to attract others isn't inherently wrong, but intentions matter. The author is explicit that he's doing this only to get with girls, which could be seen as using his wealth as a tool for manipulation. However, the girls seem to initiate contact based on what he posts, so maybe it's more of a mutual attraction scenario where they're interested in his lifestyle. \n\nThen there's the authenticity angle. He behaves differently around his friends versus when he's trying to attract girls. This could be seen as inauthentic, but many people adjust their behavior in different social settings. The key here is whether he's being deceptive. If he's not lying about his wealth and is honest about his intentions to those girls, then it's less about deception and more about using his advantages.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She called him an asshole, but her judgment is subjective. Some might argue that he's being honest about his strategy and that the girls are choosing to engage based on their own preferences. Others might see it as exploiting his wealth to gain advantage over others who can't do the same.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on relationships. If the girls he's talking to are aware of his intentions and choose to engage, then it's a matter of personal choice. However, if he's leading them to believe he's a different person than he is, that's a different story. The author mentions he's a different person around his friends, which makes me wonder if he's also being inauthentic to the girls he's trying to date. If he's not being genuine, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, societal views on using wealth for social gain vary. Some might see it as smart to leverage one's assets, while others might consider it shallow or transactional. The question is whether it's unethical to use one's resources in a dating context. There's no clear right or wrong here, but it's more about personal ethics and the consequences of his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative by some, but if he's upfront about his intentions and the other party is aware and agrees, then it's a matter of personal choice. However, since the girls are initiating contact based on his posts, they might also be using his wealth, which complicates the dynamic. The friend's judgment is subjective, and without more context on the girls' awareness, it's hard to definitively say he's wrong. But the fact that he's being inauthentic in his interactions could be a point against him. So, I'm leaning towards A, that he's in the wrong, because he's using materialism to attract others and not being genuine in his approach.\n"
