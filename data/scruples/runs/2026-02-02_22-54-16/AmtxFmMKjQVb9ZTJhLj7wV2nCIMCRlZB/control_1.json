I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the question again carefully. The user provided a scenario where a 22-year-old man with a trust fund is using his wealth to attract girls. He changes his Instagram posts to show off his condo, cars, watches, and trips, which increases his followers and DMs from girls. He also mentions dressing better, using his nicer car, going to trendy places, and talking about his dad's business to impress them. He says he's a different person when with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and acting normally. After telling a friend about his tactics, she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. The man is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which might be seen as exploiting his financial status for personal gain in relationships. Some might argue that using wealth to attract others is manipulative or inauthentic. However, others might say that it's his choice how he presents himself, and he's not directly lying if he's being honest about his wealth. \n\nHe mentions that he's a different person with his friends, which suggests he's not pretending to be someone else in those situations. But when approaching girls, he's strategically showcasing his wealth, which could be seen as insincere. The argument here might be that he's using materialism as a shortcut rather than building genuine connections based on mutual interests or personality. \n\nOn the other hand, people often present themselves in the best light possible on social media. Showing off possessions is a common tactic, and while it might be superficial, it's not necessarily unethical. The friend's reaction is a social judgment, but whether that translates to the author being \"in the wrong\" depends on societal norms and personal ethics.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't harming others directly. He's not lying about his intentions or his wealth if he's upfront about it. However, if he's leading girls on by only being interested in romantic relationships because of his wealth, that could be problematic. The scenario doesn't specify if he's being deceptive or if the girls are aware of his tactics. If they're into him because of his money and he's honest about that, it's a mutual choice. If he's pretending to be interested in them genuinely but only using them, then it's deceitful. The question states that he's using the money to get with girls, so his intention is clear, but the methods involve showing off wealth. \n\nEthically, some might argue that using wealth to attract partners is shallow and objectifies others, but others might see it as a personal strategy in a competitive dating market. The fact that he's helping his friends financially adds a layer where he's using his wealth for good in some contexts, which might balance out the negative perception from his friend. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, which is a strong judgment, but her perspective is subjective. Whether he's objectively wrong depends on broader societal views. In many cultures, using wealth for social advantage isn't illegal, but it's often frowned upon as inauthentic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, he's making choices that others might find ethically questionable. The key point is the use of wealth as a tool for gaining romantic attention, which can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. However, since it's a personal choice and not harmful in a legal or physical sense, some might argue he's not in the wrong. But socially, many might side with his friend's judgment. So, the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) due to the inauthentic and potentially manipulative nature of his actions, even if it's not illegal.\n"
