I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media and then interacting with them. He also helps his friends financially but presented himself as someone else when they met women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Using wealth to attract partners is a common criticism. People might argue that it's manipulative or insincere if the main goal is to get into relationships by showing off material possessions. The author is being upfront with his friends about his tactics, but maybe the issue is that he's being deceptive to the girls he's trying to attract. \n\nHe mentions that when he's with his friends, he acts like a regular guy, using a Honda instead of his nicer car. So, he's presenting a different persona to the girls. That could be seen as inauthentic. The friend who found out was shocked and called him an asshole, indicating that his peers also see this as wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the consent and agency of the girls. If they are attracted to his lifestyle and wealth, are they aware that it's a calculated move? If he's not being transparent about his intentions, that could be manipulative. However, if he's just being honest about his wealth and the girls are okay with that, then it's a choice they make. But the way he's using social media to \"bait\" attention might be seen as using a false image to attract people, which isn't genuine.\n\nAlso, the part where he helps his friends pay tuition is a positive aspect, but it doesn't directly relate to the issue of dating. The key issue is the manipulation of his image to attract women. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using his wealth to create a certain image to attract women, which might be seen as inauthentic or using materialism to influence relationships. People often value authenticity in relationships, and using wealth as a tool could be considered exploitative or shallow. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
