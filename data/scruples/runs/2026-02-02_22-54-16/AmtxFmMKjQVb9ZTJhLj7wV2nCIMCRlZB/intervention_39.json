I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his money and social media to attract women. He's honest with his friends but one friend called him an asshole after he revealed his strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is using his resources to gain social and romantic attention, which is a common critique in society about materialism in relationships. But he's not forced to do this; he's choosing to present himself in a certain way. However, the key point is whether this is inherently wrong. If someone uses their wealth to attract others, is that unethical? It depends on the perspective. Some might see it as manipulative or insincere, while others might argue it's just a strategy in the game of dating.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, helping them financially. He's not using his wealth for anything harmful. The friend's reaction was shock and calling him an asshole, which suggests that his friend found the approach deceptive or inauthentic. The question is whether the act of using wealth to attract others is wrong regardless of the friend's opinion.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The women he attracts through this method aren't necessarily forced into relationships; they're choosing to engage with him based on his displayed wealth. However, if the women are aware of his motives and choose to engage, it's a mutual decision. But if they're led to believe in a different version of him, that could be a problem. The author does mention he's not the same person in different contexts, so maybe there's an issue of authenticity in his interactions.\n\nBut does using money to attract people equate to being in the wrong? It's more of a judgment call. The author isn't harming anyone directly. It's about values and personal ethics. Some might say it's fair game in a social context where people use their assets to gain advantages. Others might see it as shallow or exploitative. The friend's reaction is subjective, but does that mean the author is wrong? Not necessarily. The friend's opinion is just one perspective.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't breaking any laws or ethical codes that are universally agreed upon. He's being honest with his friends, even if it's surprising to them. The core issue is whether using wealth for social gain is morally wrong. Since there's no clear consensus and the author isn't causing direct harm, it's possible that he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B, No.\n"
