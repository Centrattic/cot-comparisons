I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the guy is using his wealth to attract girls by showing off his stuff on social media. He's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and it's hard for him to get dates. He started posting his condo, cars, watches, trips, etc., and got a lot of DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business when he wants to meet girls. But when he's with his friends, he's more down-to-earth, using his Honda and going to normal bars. He told a friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether this is wrong. On one hand, he's being honest with himself about his tactics. He's not pretending to be someone else when he's trying to attract girls. But is it manipulative? Using money to attract people might be seen as superficial or transactional. However, if he's upfront about it, maybe not. But wait, he's not actually offering money; he's showing off his wealth to attract attention. It's more about image. The girls might be interested because they want to be seen with someone wealthy, not necessarily for the money itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's leading girls on by presenting a certain lifestyle without being genuine, that's a problem. But he's honest with his friends about his strategy. The friend's reaction was negative, so maybe others see it as insincere or using people. The key point is whether he's being deceptive. If he's not hiding his wealth but using it to attract girls, but when he's with friends, he's more authentic. So maybe he's not being deceptive to the girls, but he's using a particular presentation. But is that wrong? People do use their appearance and social media to project a certain image. However, if the intention is solely to attract girls, and he's aware that it's working, it's a form of manipulation. But is that inherently wrong? It's not illegal, but socially, some might see it as inauthentic. The friend called him an asshole, so there's a social judgment here. The question is whether the author's actions cross the line into being unethical or inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer depends on intent and deception. Since he's not lying but using his wealth as a tool, some might say it's his choice, but others might say it's shallow. But since he's not actively lying to the girls, maybe he's not in the wrong. Wait, but if he's building relationships based solely on wealth, that could be problematic. If the girls aren't aware of his strategy, maybe he's leading them on. But if he's honest in the interactions, maybe not. The AITA community often considers intent and harm. If the girls are fine with it, no harm. But if he's using them, then it's an issue. Since he hasn't mentioned any negative consequences from the girls' side, maybe it's not his fault. However, the friend's reaction is a social judgment. I think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because it's manipulative and using others for superficial reasons, even if it's not illegal. It's exploitative of people's materialism. Alternatively, maybe it's B (not in the wrong) because it's his strategy and he's not lying. Hmm. I'm torn. But AITA often frowns on using people for material reasons. So probably A.\n"
