I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using money to get girls. The scenario is that the person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who isn't considered good-looking and has had trouble with relationships. He started using social media to showcase his wealth\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips\u2014which increased his followers and led to DMs from \"hot girls.\" He's been doing this for a year, dressing better and showing off his nicer car to attract attention. He talks about his dad's business and his plans to join it next year. His friends aren't wealthy, and he helps pay their tuition. When he told a friend about his tactics, she called him an asshole or a douche.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong but is curious about the answer. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is using social media to flaunt wealth as a strategy to attract women. This could be seen as manipulative or insincere. The question is about whether this is wrong. On one hand, using material things to attract someone might be considered using money as a tool for dating, which is often frowned upon because it can be seen as superficial or inauthentic. People might argue that it's about status rather than genuine connection, which could lead to shallow relationships or disrespect towards the other person's values.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that he's not using money to actually pay the girls, just to showcase it. He's also helping his friends with tuition and acts normally around them, using his regular car and going to student bars. So he's not necessarily exploiting others; he's just trying to attract attention through his wealth. The friend's reaction was that he's a douche, but that's a subjective opinion. \n\nHowever, the act itself\u2014using material possessions to attract romantic partners\u2014has ethical implications. It's about using a certain part of his identity (wealth) to gain social advantages. While it's not illegal, it's a matter of personal ethics and how others perceive it. Some might say it's not the author's fault for trying to use his assets to improve his dating life, especially if he's not being deceptive beyond the presentation of his wealth. Others might argue that it's wrong to reduce one's dating appeal to material status, as it can be seen as shallow and may not lead to respectful or meaningful relationships.\n\nThe friend's shock and criticism might stem from the idea that the author isn't genuine in his approach. If he's upfront about his wealth, maybe the girls are aware of it. But if he's being deceptive by not disclosing that he's using this as a strategy, then it could be more problematic. However, the question is about the author's actions, not the deception. The friend's judgment is a reaction, but does that make the author in the wrong? It depends on the ethics of the approach. \n\nWealth can be a part of someone's identity, and there's no rule against using one's appearance or resources to attract others. However, the intention behind it matters. If he's being honest and not misleading, then it's more about his personal choice. But if he's leading others on with the pretense of being someone he's not, that's where it could cross into being wrong. The author mentions he's a \"different person when I'm with them,\" which suggests he's genuine with his friends but strategic with others. \n\nAnother angle is whether it's exploitation. If the girls are only interested in his money, then he might be perpetuating a dynamic where people are valued for their wealth. But if he's just using his own assets to attract attention and isn't hiding his intentions, it's a matter of personal strategy. \n\nIn the end, while it's not illegal, the ethical stance is debatable. Some might say it's wrong because it's using money as a tool for manipulation in dating, while others might say it's his choice and not inherently unethical. The friend's judgment is an indication that it's socially frowned upon, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the options, the answer might lean towards A (wrong) because it's about using money as a means to an end in a way that's seen as inauthentic or manipulative. But if the answer is based on the fact that he's not using money to pay them but just to attract, then B (not wrong) could be possible. However, the \"AITA\" context often considers social norms and perceptions. Since the friend called him an asshole, it's likely the community would side with A, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
