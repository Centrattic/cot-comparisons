I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls through social media and lifestyle. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund who isn't considered good-looking. He uses his wealth to post luxury items online, which gets him attention from women. He dresses better, drives nicer cars, and goes to trendy places to catch girls' attention. He also mentions telling a friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nI need to consider ethics here. Is it wrong to use your resources to attract others? Well, everyone has different ways of presenting themselves. If he's being honest about who he is, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's being deceptive, that's different. Wait, the author says he's using this approach \"only to get with girls,\" implying it's a strategy rather than his genuine self. But does that matter? People often present their best selves on social media, right? Maybe he's just being strategic with his appearance and lifestyle.\n\nHe also helps his friends financially, and acts normally around them, using his regular car and going to student bars. That suggests he's not fake in all aspects. So maybe he's being honest with his friends but using his wealth as a tool in dating contexts. Is that manipulation? Some might see it as using money to gain an advantage, which could be seen as unethical if he's pretending to be someone he's not. But others might say it's just about confidence and presenting one's assets, which is common in dating.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a point. She called him an asshole, implying she found it inauthentic. But her judgment is subjective. Some people might not mind if someone is upfront about their intentions, while others might find it off-putting. The key here is whether the author is being deceptive. If he's not lying but just using his resources to enhance his attractiveness, then maybe it's not wrong. However, if he's misleading people about his character or intentions, that's different. The author says he's \"a different person when with friends,\" which might suggest he's two-faced, but that's only in social contexts where his wealth isn't the focus. \n\nIn dating, people often curate their image. Using wealth to appear more desirable isn't inherently wrong unless there's deception involved. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's showcasing it. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that using money to attract partners is shallow or manipulative. However, personal preferences in dating vary, and if he's not harming anyone but just pursuing his own interests, it's a matter of ethics versus personal judgment. \n\nSo the answer might be B (no) because there's no explicit deception, just strategic use of resources. But I need to check if there's any hidden deceit. The author is being honest about his wealth, just using it as a tool. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
