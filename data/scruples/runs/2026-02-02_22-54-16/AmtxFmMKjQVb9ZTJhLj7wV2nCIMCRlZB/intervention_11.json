I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his money on social media and in his behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The guy is using his financial status to gain attention, which some might see as superficial or manipulative. But he's also helping his friends by paying their tuition, which is a positive aspect. The key question is whether his actions are morally wrong.\n\nHe's being honest with his friends, but maybe he's being deceptive with the girls he's trying to attract. If he's leading them to believe he's more interested in a genuine relationship when he's actually using his wealth as a tool, that could be a problem. However, the article format is asking for opinions, and the user thinks he's not in the wrong. \n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, but friends' opinions can be biased. The author is upfront with his friends about his tactics, which shows some level of honesty. Still, the main issue is whether using wealth to attract others is inherently wrong. It might be seen as using money as a tool for personal gain, which is a common critique in dating scenarios. \n\nBut the author isn't lying about his intentions directly. He's just being strategic about how he presents himself. The line between confidence and showing off can be thin. However, unless he's actively misleading the girls about his intentions, it's more about personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. It's a social judgment more than a moral wrong. The user might be looking for a justification that aligns with the initial thought, but I should check if there are any ethical violations.\n"
