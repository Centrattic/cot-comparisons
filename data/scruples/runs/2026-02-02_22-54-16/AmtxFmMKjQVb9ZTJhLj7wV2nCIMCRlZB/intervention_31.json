I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 22-year-old guy, who's wealthy, uses his money to attract girls by showing off his stuff on social media and dressing nicely. He's honest with his friends about this strategy, and one of them called him an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy is using his resources to attract attention from women, which is a common strategy but can be seen as manipulative. He's being upfront with his friends about it, which might mitigate some judgment. He's also helping his friends financially, which shows he's not a total jerk. However, the act of using money to attract partners can be viewed as transactional and insincere. \n\nThe question is whether this makes him wrong. Different perspectives here. On one hand, people might argue that it's his choice and he's being honest with his intentions. On the other hand, others might see it as exploiting his wealth to manipulate others' affections, which is ethically questionable. The friend's reaction adds another layer\u2014her shock and calling him an asshole could indicate that his actions are socially frowned upon, even if he's not breaking any laws.\n\nI should consider if there's a moral obligation to be genuine in relationships. Using money to attract partners could be seen as superficial or using another person's admiration for material things. However, if he's not lying about his intentions and is upfront, maybe it's his personal choice. There's also the aspect of consent and mutual interest. If the girls are willingly engaging because of his wealth, does that make it okay? But that line can be blurry.\n\nThe author's double standard\u2014behaving differently around his friends versus when trying to attract girls\u2014might be seen as inauthentic. However, he's helping his friends financially, which suggests he has a good side. The main issue is the method he uses to get attention. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and harm caused. If the author isn't harming anyone and is honest, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the method is considered deceptive or manipulative, even if it's honest, he might be. The key is whether using his wealth in this way is inherently wrong. Some might say it's just a strategy, others might see it as exploiting social dynamics. The friend's reaction is a data point but not definitive proof of being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, I have to decide based on common moral standards. Using money to attract partners is often criticized as superficial and potentially manipulative, so the author might be in the wrong. However, if he's honest and the girls are aware, maybe not. The fact that he's using it as a tactic to get girls might imply that the relationships aren't genuine, which is a problem. So, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because it's about using wealth to manipulate rather than building genuine connections.\n"
