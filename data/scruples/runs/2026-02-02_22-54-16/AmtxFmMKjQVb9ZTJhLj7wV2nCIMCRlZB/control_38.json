I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his money to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, dressing better and using his nicer car to catch girls' attention. He talks about his dad's business to impress them. He also helps two friends with tuition and acts normally around them, using a regular car and going to student bars.\n\nSo the key points here are: using wealth to attract women, being honest with a friend about it, and the friend's reaction. The friend called him an asshole, but the author is seeking validation. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using money to attract people can be seen as inauthentic. The author is leveraging his family's wealth to gain social capital, which might not be fair to the women if they're being attracted solely by material things. But does that make him wrong? It depends on the context. If the women are aware of his wealth and are interested in him because of that, maybe they're making a choice. However, if he's being deceptive or not honest, that's a problem. The author says he's open about his dad's business and his future role, so maybe he's not hiding it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is helping his friends, which shows he's not a bad person. The friend's shock might be because the strategy is manipulative, even if it works. The question is whether it's wrong to use one's resources to gain social advantages. Some might argue it's just a game of life, but others see it as using wealth to compensate for insecurities and possibly leading others on. \n\nI think the answer lies in the ethics of using money for social status. If the author is being honest and not misleading, maybe it's not wrong. But the friend's reaction suggests that it's seen as inconsiderate or arrogant. The author might be in the wrong for using materialism as the main tool to attract partners, as it could lead to shallow relationships. So the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong)."
