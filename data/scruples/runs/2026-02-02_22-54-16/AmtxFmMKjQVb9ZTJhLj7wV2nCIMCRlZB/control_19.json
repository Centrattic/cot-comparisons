I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and it's hard for him to get dates, so he switched to using money to get attention. He also helps his friends financially and acts normally around them, but when it comes to dating, he uses his wealth to impress women. A friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using money to attract people can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. However, some might argue that it's just a strategy in the game of dating. There's also the aspect of being honest with oneself and others. The author isn't being genuine about his intentions, which could be a problem. If the women he's interested in find out he's using his wealth as a tactic, they might feel used. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. He's not explicitly lying about who he is, just emphasizing certain aspects to attract attention. But the question is whether it's wrong to use wealth as a tool for dating. Some people might think that if you can't attract a partner without showing off money, there's an underlying issue. Others might say it's his choice how he uses his resources. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are socially frowned upon. However, if the author isn't being deceptive beyond showcasing his wealth (which is his to show), maybe there's a difference between using wealth to attract attention and actively lying. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on self-image and relationships. If the author believes he needs money to be attractive, that could indicate low self-esteem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not his psychological well-being. \n\nIn terms of ethics, manipulating someone's feelings for personal gain (even if it's just for dating) is generally considered wrong. But if he's just being upfront about his wealth and the women are choosing to engage based on that, then maybe it's a mutual agreement. However, the author admits he's doing it \"only to get with girls,\" which implies his intentions are not purely genuine. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: using wealth to attract partners can be seen as inauthentic and potentially manipulative. While it's his money and he can choose how to present himself, the method of doing so for ulterior motives might be considered ethically questionable. The friend's judgment also indicates that society might view this as a negative trait. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
