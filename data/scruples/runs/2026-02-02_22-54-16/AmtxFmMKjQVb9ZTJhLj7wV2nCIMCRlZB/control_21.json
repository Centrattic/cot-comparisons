I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young man using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his money on social media and in his behavior. He's also helping some friends with tuition but presenting himself differently when with them versus when trying to attract women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is using money to attract romantic partners. Is that inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's manipulative or that it reduces relationships to transactions. Others might say that everyone uses different aspects of themselves to attract others, and wealth isn't any different than someone using good looks or charm.\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. The author mentions that he behaves differently around his friends versus when trying to attract women. This could be seen as deceptive if he's not transparent about his intentions with the women he's dating. If he's presenting a wealthier, more extravagant version of himself to attract them but isn't being genuine, that could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the reaction of his friend. She called him an asshole, which adds a social judgment to the situation. But her judgment might be influenced by her own values. The question is whether the author's actions are exploitative. If he's not using manipulation beyond showing off his wealth, some might say it's just a strategy, albeit a bit self-centered.\n\nAlso, the author is helping friends with tuition, which shows a different side of him. This might complicate the judgment, as it could indicate he's not entirely selfish. However, the key issue is in the context of dating. Using wealth to attract partners can be seen as problematic because it might not build genuine connections. It could also lead to women who are primarily interested in his money rather than his personality, which could create issues in the relationships.\n\nThere's also the aspect of social media use. Posting luxurious items to gain attention could be seen as inauthentic or as using a facade. The fact that he changes his behavior (different car, different places) depending on his audience suggests a lack of authenticity, which some might view as insincere.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, it's a gray area. Some people might argue that it's his choice how he approaches dating, while others might see it as exploiting his wealth in a way that's not respectful to potential partners. The key points are authenticity, manipulation, and the nature of the relationships formed through this method. If the author is being transparent with the women he's dating about his motivations and they're okay with it, that's one thing. But if he's deceiving them into believing he's interested in a genuine relationship when he's primarily using his wealth to attract them, then it's more clearly problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer could swing either way. However, generally, using material wealth as a primary tool to attract partners is often criticized as inauthentic and potentially exploitative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
