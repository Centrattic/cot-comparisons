I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he's a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not considered good-looking and has trouble getting dates. He started using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He mentions he's only doing this to get with girls but is a normal guy with non-wealthy friends, even helping them pay tuition. He acts differently around them, using his Honda and going to student bars. Recently, he told a friend about this strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether his actions are unethical. Using social media to present oneself in a certain way isn't inherently wrong. Everyone curates their online presence. But when he's using his wealth specifically to attract attention from women, is that manipulation? It could be seen as using money to gain social advantage, which some might view as inauthentic or transactional. However, others might argue that it's his way of navigating social situations and that everyone uses their strengths.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest with his friends. When he told his friend about his strategy, she was shocked, which might indicate that he's being upfront rather than deceptive. If he were lying about his wealth or intentions, that could be worse. But here, he's using his actual resources to attract attention, which isn't illegal. However, the intention to \"get with girls\" by showcasing wealth could imply a lack of genuine interest in relationships, which some might find shallow or disrespectful. But is that truly wrong? It's a subjective judgment.\n\nThe friend's reaction is key. She called him an asshole, thinking he's the biggest douche in the city. That suggests she perceives his actions as unethical. But her judgment is based on her values. If the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, it's about societal norms. Some might say it's his choice how he uses his money, while others might see it as exploiting his wealth for superficial gains. The fact that he's helping his friends financially shows he's not entirely self-serving, which could mitigate his actions.\n\nAnother angle: consent. Are the girls who DM him aware of his intentions? If he's transparent in his interactions with them, maybe they're okay with the dynamic. But if he's leading them on without disclosure, that could be problematic. The story doesn't mention deception, just a strategy. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but some might still criticize his approach as shallow or manipulative. However, unless he's causing direct harm, it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nIn summary, while some may judge his tactics as inauthentic or using money to manipulate, others might see it as a legitimate strategy given his circumstances. The key is whether his actions are deceptive or harmful. Since he's not lying about his wealth and is upfront with friends, maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's a strong argument that using wealth solely for social advantages can be seen as unethical. The answer hinges on societal values and personal ethics.\n"
