I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old wealthy guy who uses his money to attract girls through social media. He admits he's not good-looking and uses his trust fund to show off his condo, cars, etc. He also mentions that when he's with his less wealthy friends, he's more down-to-earth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The author is being honest about his intentions\u2014using money to attract attention. But does that make him a \"douche\"? Maybe. The friend's reaction suggests she thinks he's being inauthentic or manipulative. However, the author isn't hiding his wealth; he's openly using it. If girls are into that, maybe they're aware of his motivations?\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that using wealth to attract others is superficial and not genuine. But is it inherently wrong? People often use their assets (looks, charisma, money) to attract others. The key here is whether the author is being deceptive. He's not lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. The problem might be the lack of authenticity in his interactions, but if the girls are into that lifestyle, maybe it's mutual.\n\nAlso, the author helps his friends financially, showing he's not a bad person. The friend's judgment might stem from her own values, not necessarily the author's actions. So, is it wrong? It's a matter of personal ethics. Using money to attract isn't illegal or harmful, but some might see it as inauthentic. The answer depends on whether manipulation is involved, which it might be if he's pretending to be someone else. However, if he's honest about his intentions, maybe not. So, the answer could be B, but there's nuance.\n"
