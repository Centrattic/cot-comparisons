I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund, not good-looking, and he uses Instagram to show off his possessions to get attention from women. He also mentions that he's different with his non-wealthy friends. His friend called him an asshole for being honest about his strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using money to attract people can be seen as manipulative. It's one thing to be confident in your assets, but if it's a deliberate tactic to get dates, that might be problematic. The key question is whether this is deceptive or if it's just a matter of personal choice.\n\nThe author is upfront with his friends about his approach, which he shares as a strategy. The friend's reaction suggests that honesty about using wealth as a tool is frowned upon. But does that make it wrong? In social contexts, people often have different standards. Some might argue that it's fair game to use your resources if you're not lying. Others might see it as using money to compensate for other shortcomings, which could be considered shallow or arrogant.\n\nAlso, the author helps his friends financially, which might mitigate some criticism. However, the act of using wealth as a primary means to attract partners could be seen as exploiting social status. Relationships ideally should be based on mutual respect and connection, not materialism. While there's no law against this, socially, it's often viewed negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has different ways of attracting partners. If he's not lying and is honest about his intentions, some might argue it's his personal choice. The friend's judgment is subjective, and the author isn't necessarily hurting anyone if the women are aware of his wealth and still choose to engage. But the issue arises when it's a calculated strategy to manipulate perceptions, which can be seen as inauthentic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the social and ethical judgment is mixed. However, the consensus leans towards it being a form of manipulation, which is generally frowned upon in relationships. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
