I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old who comes from a wealthy family. They're not good-looking and have had trouble connecting with girls. So they started showcasing their wealth through social media\u2014posting about their condo, cars, trips. This led to an increase in followers and DMs from women. They mention dressing better, driving nicer cars, and going to trendy places to catch attention. Their main goal is to attract girls by talking about their dad's business and their future role in it. \n\nThe key points here are the use of wealth as a tool to attract romantic interest. The author is honest about their intentions, which is important. They also mention that they're a different person with their friends, supporting them financially and keeping a more modest lifestyle when with them. However, when they told a friend about their strategy, she was shocked and called them an asshole/douche.\n\nNow, considering whether this is right or wrong. On one hand, the author isn't lying about their wealth; they are using it as a part of their identity. It's their choice how they present themselves. People often use various strategies to attract others, and while some might find it superficial, it's not inherently unethical. The author isn't scamming anyone; they're being open (to their friends) about their approach. However, if they're leading the girls on with the intention of exploiting their wealth without genuine interest, that could be problematic. But the scenario doesn't mention manipulation or deceit beyond showing off wealth.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's using others for superficial reasons, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Unless there's deception involved, it's more of a judgment about values. The author isn't committing a crime or wrongdoing, just engaging in a strategy that others might find crass. The friend's reaction is subjective; her judgment doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether using wealth to attract others is morally wrong. Since there's no deception or harm beyond what's consensual, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the friend's perspective highlights potential social judgment. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't violating any moral laws, just engaging in a choice that others might dislike.\n"
