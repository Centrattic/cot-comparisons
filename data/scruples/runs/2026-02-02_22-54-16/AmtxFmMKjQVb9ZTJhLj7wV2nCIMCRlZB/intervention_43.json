I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls on social media. The story is from a 22-year-old guy who comes from a wealthy family but isn't good-looking. He started using Instagram to post about his condo, cars, watches, and trips, which increased his followers and led to DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better and uses his nicer car to catch attention, talks about his dad's business, and plans to join it next year. He's helping friends pay tuition and acts normally with them, switching to his Honda and going to student bars. He told a friend his secret, and she was shocked, calling him an asshole or douche.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he isn't). \n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative. If he's being deceptive by showcasing his wealth to get attention, that's a problem. But he's not lying about the wealth itself; he does have it. The issue is whether he's using it inauthentically or exploiting it to manipulate others' interest. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. People often use their assets to enhance their social status or attract partners. However, when it's done in a way that's transparently calculated, like using social media posts as a strategy, it can come off as inauthentic. The fact that he's sharing his intentions with others, like saying he's doing this to get with girls, might be a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not hiding his wealth. He's open about it, and even with his friends, he's generous and acts normally when they're together. The friend's reaction suggests that the method feels inauthentic, which could harm trust or make the relationships based on those DMs transactional. \n\nAlso, the age and context matter. At 22, it's common for people to experiment with social strategies. But using money to attract others can lead to shallow connections. The key points are deception and manipulation. If he's not lying but merely using his existing wealth as a tool to gain attention, is that wrong? Maybe not illegal, but ethically questionable. \n\nAnother angle: consent and honesty. If the girls are aware of his wealth and choose to engage, maybe it's their choice. But if he's pretending to be someone else or using his wealth to mask other insecurities, that's different. The problem might be that he's not being genuine. \n\nThe friend's reaction implies that revealing the method made her uncomfortable. That could be because she sees it as inauthentic. So, is the wrong in the method or in how it's perceived? \n\nIn conclusion, while it's not against the law, using wealth as a primary tool to attract others might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The author's actions could be viewed as exploitative if the intention is purely to gain romantic attention through material means rather than building genuine connections. However, some might argue that it's his way of leveraging his assets in a world where appearance and status are often valued. The key here is the intent and the perception of it as inauthentic. Since the friend called him an asshole, it shows that this strategy is viewed negatively by others, which could indicate that there's something ethically off-putting about it. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to be careful. The author isn't lying about his possessions; he's just using them strategically. But if he's aware that he's using them to manipulate others' interest, that's where the ethical issue lies. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because the intent is to use money as a tool for attraction, which can be seen as inauthentic and potentially exploiting others' materialistic tendencies.\n"
