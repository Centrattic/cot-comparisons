I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family, uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his possessions on social media and in person. He's open about doing this to get dates, but when he told a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is using his money to gain attention from women, which could be seen as manipulative or insincere. But does that make him wrong? Some people might argue that it's his choice how he uses his resources, and if the women are into that, it's mutual. However, others might say it's objectifying or using others for his own benefit without genuine connection.\n\nThe author mentions he's different with his non-wealthy friends, which might show he's aware of his behavior. But the key issue is whether using money to attract others is inherently wrong. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that his method is frowned upon. Maybe the problem is the intent\u2014using material things solely to get dates rather than building real relationships. But the women are also choosing to engage, so maybe it's a matter of perspective. \n\nI should also think about whether the author is being deceptive. If he's honest about his wealth and intentions, some might see it as transparent. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not to impress them, that could be deceptive. The post says he's upfront about his dad's business, so maybe he's not lying. \n\nAnother angle is whether it's ethical to use social media to curate an image to attract people. Social media often involves curation, so maybe it's not unique. However, doing it specifically to manipulate attention might cross a line. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see it as just a strategy in dating, while others might find it shallow. The friend's judgment implies it's considered inappropriate. But does that mean he's in the wrong? It's possible the author isn't harming anyone if the women are willingly engaging, but the method is seen as inauthentic. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because using wealth to manipulate social interactions for personal gain, even if not illegal, is ethically questionable and could be seen as insincere or objectifying others.\n"
