I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 22-year-old man uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media and in person. He tells his friends about this strategy, and one of them calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is using his wealth to gain attention from women, which could be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The key points are whether this is deceptive or if it's just a personal choice in dating. \n\nHe mentions that he's not good-looking and this is a tactic he's developed. While he's honest with his friends about his approach, the issue might be that he's using materialism as a tool to attract partners, which some might view as shallow or exploitative. However, others might argue that it's his personal strategy and not harmful as long as he's not lying outright.\n\nHe also helps his friends financially, which shows he's not entirely self-centered. But the main question is about the women he's attracting through this method. Are they aware that his wealth is the primary allure? If they're genuinely interested in him and not just his money, then it's a mutual choice. However, if he's leading them on under false pretenses, that's different. The story doesn't mention deception, just that he's being strategic with his appearance and social media.\n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, but that's just one person's opinion. The author isn't breaking any laws, but the moral judgment is subjective. In dating contexts, using wealth isn't inherently wrong, but it might be frowned upon socially if it's perceived as using money to manipulate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using wealth to attract partners is considered unethical. Some might say yes because it's inauthentic, others no because it's a personal choice. The AITA community often looks at harm caused. Since there's no mention of harm to the women, just that the friend is upset, the author might not be in the wrong. But the friend's perspective is valid too. \n\nOverall, the consensus might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because there's no deception, but it's a judgment call. However, the act of being inauthentic in relationships is often seen as a negative trait. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's using a manipulative tactic to achieve his goals, even if it's not illegal. Alternatively, B (No) if it's seen as a personal strategy without harm.\n"
