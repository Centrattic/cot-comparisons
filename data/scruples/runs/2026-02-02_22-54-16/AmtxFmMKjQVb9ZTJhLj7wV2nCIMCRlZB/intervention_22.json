I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 22-year-old wealthy individual using his status and possessions to attract women, and after confiding in a friend, she labels him an asshole. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is whether using wealth and social media strategically to attract partners is morally wrong. The author is being honest about his intentions and methods. He's leveraging his resources, which he has access to, to achieve his goals. While some might argue that this is manipulative or inauthentic, others might see it as smart self-promotion, especially in a society where social media presence can influence social interactions.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The women he interacts with are presumably aware of his lifestyle through his social media before engaging with him in person. There's no indication of deception; he's upfront about his wealth and intentions when he meets them. However, the friend's reaction suggests that there's a social taboo against such direct use of wealth for romantic purposes, which could affect how others perceive his actions.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's a different person with his non-wealthy friends, supporting them financially. This duality might not necessarily make him wrong, but it could be seen as inauthentic. The key question is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently unethical. There's no clear right or wrong here, but societal norms often frown upon transactional relationships, even if both parties are consenting adults.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often judge based on perceived honesty and respect. Since he's not lying about his status and is open about his intentions, some might argue he's not in the wrong. However, others might see it as using his wealth in a way that's exploitative or superficial. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a key point. Her judgment highlights that the method is considered inappropriate, which could influence the conclusion. But the author isn't harming anyone, just using available means. The answer might hinge on whether the method is considered deceitful. Since he's honest about his wealth and intentions, and the women approach him consensually, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the approach is seen as manipulative or transactional, then he could be considered at fault.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest and there's no coercion involved. However, it's a nuanced situation where societal norms play a big role. The answer is B (No).\n"
