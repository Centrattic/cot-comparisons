I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his money on social media and in his lifestyle. He's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. On one hand, using wealth to attract partners might be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. It could be argued that he's not being genuine and is using material things to get what he wants, which might be exploitative. Women might feel they're being lured by his wealth rather than his personality, leading to potential issues later if they find out the truth. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that others might see this as inconsiderate or deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he's a different person with his friends, helping them financially and living a normal life. He's not being dishonest with the women in an outright way\u2014maybe he's not lying about his wealth, just emphasizing it. It's also a common strategy in dating to highlight one's best qualities, and wealth is a socially valued trait. The question is whether it's wrong to use this as a tool when he's not physically attractive. Some might say it's his way of navigating the dating market, similar to how others might use looks or charisma.\n\nBut the key issue here is intent. If he's being honest about his wealth, it's not exactly lying, but he's leveraging it to attract women, which could be seen as superficial. The friend's shock and the label of \"asshole\" imply that there's a social judgment against this behavior. It's about whether using wealth in this way is unethical, even if it's not illegal. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, it's debatable. The friend's reaction also shows that even among peers, this approach is frowned upon.\n\nI need to decide if this is a matter of moral wrong or if it's a personal choice. The author isn't harming anyone directly, but he's not being his authentic self either. The women are presumably aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for that reason. However, if their interest is based on his money rather than him as a person, it could lead to insincere relationships. The author's own admission that he sounds like a \"huge douche\" suggests he's aware of the social stigma but still chooses to do it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong if we consider that he's honest about his wealth, but the method of using it to attract women is seen as inauthentic and possibly manipulative. The friend's reaction and the general societal view might lean towards considering it wrong, even if not illegal. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because it's about using wealth in a way that's perceived as deceptive or inconsiderate, even if it's not a direct lie.\n"
