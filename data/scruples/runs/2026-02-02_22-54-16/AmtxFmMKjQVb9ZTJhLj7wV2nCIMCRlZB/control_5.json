I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The situation is that he's a wealthy guy, not good-looking, and he's using his status to get attention. He posts about his wealth on social media, dresses up, drives nice cars, and talks about his dad's business to impress girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. People might argue that it's using material possessions as a tool for personal gain in relationships, which isn't genuine. On the other hand, some might say it's just a strategy, and he's using what he has to his advantage. But then, there's the aspect of honesty. He's presenting a certain image online, which could be misleading if his real self isn't as flashy. However, he does mention being different with his friends, so maybe he's aware of his image but is being authentic in other contexts.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. If he's being deceptive to get into relationships, that's a problem. But if he's just being open about his approach, even if it's superficial, maybe it's not inherently wrong. His friend's reaction suggests that others see it as inauthentic and maybe even arrogant. The fact that he admitted it to a friend shows he's self-aware, but the friend's shock indicates that his actions are socially frowned upon.\n\nAlso, considering the intention: he's using money specifically to get with girls, which could be seen as objectifying women by offering status in exchange for attention. That's a negative point. However, there's no mention of actual harm beyond the perception of being a \"douche.\" If the relationships are consensual and based on mutual interest, maybe the issue is more about personal values than actual wrongdoing.\n\nBut, if he's not being genuine in his interactions with the girls, that's a problem. Using wealth as a tool can create relationships based on materialism rather than genuine connection. The friend's label of \"asshole\" suggests that his method is seen as unethical. The key is whether he's being deceptive. If he's upfront about his wealth and intentions, it's different, but if he's pretending to be someone else, that's manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, the ethical stance here depends on the authenticity of his interactions. Since he's using wealth as a tool to attract, it's likely seen as inauthentic and manipulative, making him the asshole. The answer would be A.\n"
