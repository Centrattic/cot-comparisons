I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using money to get girls. The scenario is that he's a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls. He started posting luxury items on Instagram to gain attention, and now gets a lot of DMs. He mentions dressing better, showing off his car, talking about his dad's business, and that he's different when with his friends, helping them with tuition and all. He told one friend his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is using wealth to attract women. There's a debate about whether it's manipulative or just a strategy. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's showcasing it. But is that inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's using materialism to attract others, which could be seen as shallow. Others might say that if he's honest about his intentions, there's no deception, but if he's pretending to be someone else just to get dates, that's different.\n\nHe mentions that he's a different person with his friends, taking a Honda instead of his nicer car. This shows he's aware of the image he projects and is adjusting it for different audiences. The fact that he's helping friends pay tuition might suggest he's not completely self-serving, but that's separate from his dating strategy.\n\nHis friend called him an asshole, which is a social judgment. But does that mean he's objectively in the wrong? The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just others' opinions. If he's not lying directly but using his assets strategically, is that unethical? Maybe, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, if he's leading women on by only focusing on his wealth to attract them without genuine connection, that could be manipulative. On the other hand, if the women are interested in his wealth and he's aware, then it's a mutual exchange.\n\nAnother angle is authenticity. He's presenting a certain image to attract attention, which could be seen as inauthentic. But isn't everyone curating their image to some extent on social media? The key is whether he's being deceptive. If he's upfront about his intentions, maybe not, but the article says he's using this strategy to \"get with girls,\" implying that the women might not know his real intent. However, since he's upfront about his wealth and talks about his dad's business, maybe the women are aware they're being courted through material displays.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a data point. She thinks he's an asshole for being deceptive. If he's being transparent with the women, perhaps the friend's judgment is misplaced. But if he's not genuine in his interactions, leading women to believe he's interested in them beyond just their looks, then he's being deceptive.\n\nIn summary, the ethical issue is about honesty and authenticity. If he's not lying about who he is but using his wealth strategically, some might say it's his right to use his assets. However, if it's manipulative and inauthentic, then others might say he's in the wrong. The answer could go either way, but given the context where he's using wealth as a tool to attract women without genuine emotional engagement, the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong (option A).\n"
