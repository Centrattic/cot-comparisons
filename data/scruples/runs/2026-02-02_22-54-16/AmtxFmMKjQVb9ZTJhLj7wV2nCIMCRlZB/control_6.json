I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the described situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young man using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media and in person. He's a trust fund kid, not good looking, and has switched tactics after finding it hard to connect with girls otherwise. He's also helping friends pay tuition and acts differently around them. When he revealed his method to a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract romantic interest. Is it wrong to leverage your assets to get what you want? People often use various strategies to attract others\u2014looks, charm, social status, etc. Wealth could be seen as just another tool here. But there's a nuance. The line might be crossed if it's deceptive or manipulative. However, in this case, he's not lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. The question is whether that's inherently wrong.\n\nThen there's the aspect of his behavior towards friends. He's helping them financially, which is a positive trait. But when he told his friend his method, she was shocked and called him an asshole. That reaction might stem from her values\u2014maybe she thinks it's inauthentic or objectifying. But is that a valid judgment? The man isn't doing harm beyond what's socially considered inauthentic. If he's honest with the women he's interested in, maybe it's not wrong. However, if he's leading them on with the expectation of something more without genuine intent, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on his relationships. By using wealth as a front, is he being genuine? Authenticity in relationships is important, but people often present different sides in social contexts. The key issue here is whether he's being deceptive. He's not hiding his wealth; he's actively showcasing it. The problem might be the ulterior motive\u2014he's doing it solely to attract women. That could be seen as using his money as a tool for manipulation, which some might consider unethical.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's reaction, she might feel betrayed because he's acting two-faced. But if he's being honest with the women he's trying to attract, maybe it's not his fault. The problem could be his lack of self-awareness about how his actions are perceived. However, societal norms often frown upon using wealth to attract partners, especially if it's seen as inauthentic or superficial.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the action is about honesty and not deception, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the method is considered manipulative or insincere, then he could be. The key here is whether he's being transparent with the women he's interested in. The question doesn't specify if he's upfront about his intentions or if he's pretending to be someone he's not. If he's honest, then it's a matter of personal choice. If he's deceptive, then he's in the wrong. Since the details don't indicate deception, just strategic self-presentation, it's a gray area. However, the common societal view might lean towards finding him in the wrong for being inauthentic.\n"
