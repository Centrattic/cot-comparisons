I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a 22-year-old trust fund kid who isn't good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started showcasing his wealth through social media, like posting his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from girls. He uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, talks about his dad's business to impress. He mentions he's a different person around his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and acting more normal.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this behavior is considered wrong. The key points here are using wealth to attract women, being deceptive about his lifestyle when with friends, and the friend's reaction. The author is aware that he's being a \"douche\" but only in the context of trying to get girls. His friends don't know about his wealth, so he's presenting a different image in different social circles.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes him in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, using money to attract others can be seen as superficial or manipulative. If he's pretending to be someone he's not just to get dates, that's insincere. However, some might argue that it's his choice to express his wealth and that he's not lying if he actually has the resources. The problem might be more about his intentions and the impact on others.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, which suggests that she found it unethical or inconsiderate. But her perspective might be influenced by her own values. The author is helping his friends financially, which could be a point in his favor, but that doesn't necessarily justify his behavior. The key is whether his actions are deceptive or if he's using his wealth in a way that's honest but still inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a common criticism about people using money to attract partners, which can be seen as transactional or inauthentic. However, if he's not explicitly offering money for dates but using his wealth as a social tool, it's a gray area. The deception part is significant here. If he's hiding his wealth from his friends to fit in, that's another layer of insincerity. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Ethically, it's more subjective. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the ethics depend on intentions and honesty. If he's being upfront with the girls about his wealth and intentions, then it's his choice. But if he's misleading them by appearing more down-to-earth when he's not, that's a problem. \n\nConsidering all this, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's being deceptive, both to the girls he's dating and his friends. Using wealth as a tool to attract others can be seen as shallow, and the fact that he changes his behavior in different social settings adds to the inauthenticity. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
