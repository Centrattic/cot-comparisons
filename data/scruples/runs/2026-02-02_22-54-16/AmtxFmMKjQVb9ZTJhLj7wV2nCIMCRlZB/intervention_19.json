I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a wealthy guy who uses his money and status to attract girls by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions being a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and that this is his way to get dates. He also helps friends pay tuition and acts normally around them.\n\nHmm, the user's initial thought is the author isn't wrong, but they want opinions. The key points here are about using wealth to attract others and the honesty about it. There's a part where he told a friend, and she called him an asshole. \n\nI need to consider ethics here. Is it wrong to use your money to attract people? Some might say it's superficial or manipulative, others might say it's honest self-promotion. But the author is upfront about his intentions. There's also the aspect of being different around friends, which shows he's aware of different social contexts. \n\nBut does using money to get dates inherently make him wrong? Maybe not, but some people might view it as using someone else's money instead of authentic connection. The friend's reaction suggests she found it unethical. However, others might argue that people have different ways to attract partners, and as long as there's no deception, it's their choice. \n\nThe author isn't lying about his wealth, so it's not a deception. He's honest about his tactics. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If he's being honest and not lying, maybe it's not wrong. But the moral judgment can vary. Some might see it as shallow, others as strategic. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, using money for social gain is acceptable, in others, it's seen as exploiting status. Since there's no harm mentioned beyond the friend's judgment, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to decide between A and B. Given that the author is honest about his approach and it's not causing harm beyond his friend's opinion, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the friend's reaction shows that others might see it as wrong, so there's a gray area. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not societal judgment. If the actions are within legal and ethical bounds of personal choice, then B. If exploiting others' money for personal gain is wrong, then A. \n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards B because it's about personal strategy and not harming others directly. So the answer is B.\n"
