I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family. They mention using their wealth to attract girls by showcasing their possessions on social media. People are DMing them, and they're dressing better, using nicer cars, etc., to catch attention. They talk about their dad's business and future involvement as part of their approach. They also mention being a different person when with their non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition, and acting more down-to-earth.\n\nThe key issue here is whether using wealth to attract partners is unethical. On one hand, the person isn't being deceptive about their wealth; they're openly showing it off. However, they're using it as a tool to gain social advantages, which some might see as insincere or manipulative. The friend's reaction suggests that their behavior is perceived as inauthentic, which could lead to a lack of genuine connections. The question is whether this is inherently wrong or just a personal choice in dating strategies.\n\nEthically, honesty and authenticity are valued. While it's not illegal, using wealth to attract others might be seen as exploiting one's privilege. The person is being upfront about their intentions and methods once asked, so there's no deceit involved. But the problem might be in the perception of inauthenticity. If they're not being their true self when seeking relationships, that's a valid concern. However, dating strategies vary, and some might argue that using one's assets isn't inherently wrong. The line is blurry here. The person isn't harming others directly, but the approach could lead to superficial connections. So, whether they're in the wrong depends on societal views on authenticity in relationships. I think the answer leans towards AITA (Author Is the Asshole) because the friend's reaction indicates the behavior is seen as inconsiderate and fake, even if it's not unethical in a strict sense.\n"
