I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old with a trust fund, is using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and in his behavior. He's also helping his friends pay tuition but keeps his different approach to dating a secret. His friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is being honest about his motivations\u2014using money to attract women. That's a bit of a red flag because it's about using materialism rather than genuine connection. But is that inherently wrong? Some people might argue that if both parties are consenting adults, then it's not wrong. However, there's manipulation involved here. He's presenting a false image to get what he wants, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nThen there's the impact on his relationships. His friend was shocked and upset, indicating that his actions might be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate. Even though he's generous with his wealth by helping his friends with tuition, that doesn't necessarily offset the manipulation in his dating life. \n\nAlso, the fact that he only uses his wealth when trying to impress girls, not when with friends, suggests a disingenuous public persona. People might feel he's two-faced. The key issue here is authenticity. If he's being inauthentic in his interactions, that's a problem in relationships built on trust and genuine connection.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different dating strategies. Some might use their looks, others their wit or money. But using wealth to attract partners can lead to transactional relationships, which might not be sustainable or healthy. The question is whether it's wrong to do so intentionally. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important too. If someone feels like a friend is being deceptive or manipulative, that's a valid concern. The author's actions might harm his reputation and relationships if others find out. \n\nSo, weighing all this, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical judgment hinges on deception and manipulation for personal gain. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
