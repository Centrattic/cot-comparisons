I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The situation is that he's a trust fund kid who's not considered good-looking and has resorted to showcasing his wealth through social media posts and lifestyle to get attention from women. He's also helping his friends pay tuition and acts normally around them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she was shocked and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as using materialism or status as a tool for romantic purposes. This might be viewed as inauthentic or manipulative because it's about projecting a certain image rather than building genuine connections. However, the author is honest with himself about his motivations, even acknowledging that he sounds like a \"huge douche.\" He also mentions that he's different with his non-wealthy friends, showing he's not entirely inauthentic in all areas of his life.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, which suggests that she perceives his actions as insincere or exploitative. But does that mean he's objectively wrong? It might depend on cultural or personal values. In some contexts, using wealth to attract partners is seen as a strategy rather than unethical. However, if it's done without any genuine intent to build a relationship and purely for superficial reasons, it could be criticized.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't harming anyone directly. He's not lying about his wealth, just highlighting aspects of his life that appeal to others. People choose to engage with him based on the image he presents. However, if he's not upfront about his intentions from the start, that could be problematic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is effective or advisable.\n\nAlso, the fact that he helps his friends financially shows a different side of him, which might mitigate some of the negative judgment. But the core issue is about the use of wealth in dating. There's a societal debate about using money to attract partners. Some see it as a personal choice, while others view it as shallow or transactional.\n\nIn conclusion, whether it's wrong or not is subjective. The author isn't breaking any rules, but his approach is ethically questionable from a societal standpoint. The friend's reaction is a valid perspective, but the author's own acknowledgment of his tactics as potentially douche-like shows self-awareness. The answer hinges on whether using wealth in this way is considered morally wrong, which varies. However, given the context, the author's actions are inconsiderate and insincere, so he might be in the wrong. But there's a counterargument that it's his choice. I'm leaning towards A (he is in the wrong) because it's about using materialism as a crutch to compensate for perceived lack of other qualities, which can be seen as manipulative.\n"
