I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's gotten DMs from \"hot girls,\" and he's changed his behavior to fit this image. He's also helping his friends pay tuition and acts normally around them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest with himself about his intentions. He's not pretending to be someone else when he's with his friends, so there's some authenticity there. Also, he's using his own money, not exploiting others, and it's his choice how to present himself to attract others. People often use various tactics to attract partners, whether it's through looks, personality, or resources. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue he's being inauthentic in his dating approach, using wealth as a crutch. But is that inherently wrong? Everyone has different values when it comes to relationships. If the girls he's attracting are okay with his approach, then it's their choice. However, the friend's reaction suggests that this method is seen as shallow or manipulative. The key here is whether his actions are harmful. He's not stealing or lying about his wealth\u2014just using it to attract attention. \n\nI think the moral of the story is that while his method might be considered shallow by some, unless he's being deceptive or harming others, it's his choice. The friend's judgment is subjective, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for using his resources in a way that works for him.\n"
