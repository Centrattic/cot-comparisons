I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 22-year-old guy who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his stuff on social media and being flashy. He's also helping his friends financially but behaves differently around them. The friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Using money to attract partners isn't inherently wrong, but the intention and method matter. If he's being deceptive, that's a problem. The guy is presenting himself as wealthy and successful through his social media, which might be misleading. He's not outright lying, but he's curating a specific image to get attention. Also, he's using his wealth as a primary way to attract women, which could be seen as objectifying or treating women as they're only interested in his money.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. He told a friend about his tactic, and she was upset. That friend's reaction suggests that she found the approach manipulative or unethical. While that's just one person's perspective, it does indicate that others might view his actions negatively. The key point is whether he's being deceptive or if it's just a strategic use of his resources.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the women who message him. If they're interested in him because of his wealth and then later find out he's not as successful, that could lead to hurt feelings. But if they're aware of his situation and still choose to engage, it's mutual. However, the post suggests he's not being transparent about his approach, which could lead to insincere connections.\n\nThe fact that he's a \"trust fund kid\" but not using his wealth in a way that's authentic to his daily life (e.g., driving a Honda with friends) raises questions about his authenticity. He's compartmentalizing his life, which might indicate a lack of genuine intent in his interactions with women. This could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, people often use their strengths to attract partners. If his wealth is a part of his life, why shouldn't he present it? However, doing so in a way that's purely transactional and without genuine connection might be the issue. The line between using one's assets and being inauthentic is thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions could be seen as in the wrong because he's using his wealth as a primary tool to attract women without genuine intent, potentially leading to insincere relationships and being deceptive about his true nature. The friend's reaction supports this view. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
