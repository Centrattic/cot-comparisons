I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a 22-year-old wealthy man using his money to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media and in person. He's also helping friends pay tuition but behaves differently when with them. His friend called him an asshole after he confessed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is whether using wealth to attract romantic interest is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's manipulative or inauthentic, using material status to gain attention. Others might say it's not unethical since he's being honest about his intentions and it's a personal choice in dating.\n\nHe mentions he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates, so he's adapting his approach. But does that justify the method? There's a line between self-promotion and exploitation. If he's upfront about his wealth and the girls are aware, maybe they choose to engage. However, if he's misleading or using his status to manipulate, that's different.\n\nAlso, his behavior changes depending on the context\u2014he acts different around the girls vs. his friends. This duality might be seen as inauthentic, but it's not uncommon for people to adjust their presentation in different social settings. The key point is whether he's being deceptive about his true self. If he's honest with the girls about his wealth and intentions, it's his choice. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not (like being less wealthy), that's a different story.\n\nHis friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, but that's a subjective opinion. The question is whether his actions are objectively wrong. Ethically, there's no law against using wealth to attract partners. However, societal morals might judge it as shallow or selfish. The author might be criticized for prioritizing wealth over genuine connections, but it's still a personal decision unless it harms others (which isn't indicated here).\n\nThe friend's shock and judgment don't necessarily mean he's wrong. People have different values. The author isn't harming anyone directly; he's just using a strategy that works for him. The fact that he's helping friends with tuition suggests he's not entirely self-serving, which could balance the judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, whether it's wrong depends on perspective. Legally and ethically, there's no clear wrongdoing. It's a matter of personal choice and societal judgment. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), as there's no evidence of deceit or harm beyond personal preferences.\n"
