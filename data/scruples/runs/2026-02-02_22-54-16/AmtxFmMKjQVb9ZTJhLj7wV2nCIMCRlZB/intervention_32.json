I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and found it hard to get with girls, so he started posting his luxury stuff on Instagram to get attention. His followers increased, and he got DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He also mentions he helps two friends with tuition and behaves normally around them, using a regular car and going to student bars. He told one friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are deception and intent. He's using his wealth as a tool to attract girls, which he admits is just for getting with them. He's being upfront with the girls he's interested in, but the issue might be the deception in how he presents himself. However, the girl he told said he's an asshole, but others don't know his strategy. \n\nHe's not lying about his wealth, just emphasizing it to attract attention. The problem arises if he's leading the girls on with false intentions. If he's genuinely interested in relationships but uses his wealth as a means, that's a matter of opinion. Some might see it as using money to manipulate, others might see it as leveraging his assets. The friend's reaction is negative, but that's just one person's view. \n\nAlso, he helps friends financially, which shows he's not a bad person. But the question is about being in the wrong in the context of using money for dating. The ethics of using wealth to attract partners can be subjective. If the girls know his situation (he's not hiding it), maybe it's their choice. If he's honest with them and they're okay with it, then it's their decision. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not, that's different. He's not pretending to be someone else; he's being himself but highlighting his wealth. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's not lying about who he is, just using his resources to attract attention. However, some might argue it's superficial or inconsiderate. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's no harm mentioned to the girls, it's a matter of personal ethics. Since he's not physically or emotionally harming them, and if the girls are aware, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's leading them to believe he's into them for other reasons when it's just about money, that's deceitful. However, the narrative says he's honest about his intentions. So, the answer might be B.\n"
