I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 22-year-old who's using their wealth to attract women by showcasing luxury items on social media. They admit to being not good-looking and struggling to get dates otherwise. They switch their behavior to post about their condo, cars, trips, etc., to get attention. They also mention acting differently around friends versus when trying to meet girls.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's consider ethics and social norms here. Using wealth to attract others isn't inherently unethical, but the intent and methods matter. The key points are: they're being inauthentic, using materialism as a tool, and manipulating their image. The friend's reaction that they're an \"asshole/douche\" suggests social disapproval. \n\nAuthenticity is important in relationships. If someone is only interested in others because of their wealth, that's one thing, but if the person is pretending to be someone they're not to attract others, it's manipulative. The fact that they have to act a certain way and change their behavior (nice car vs. Honda) shows a lack of authenticity. Also, the friend's shock indicates that this behavior isn't acceptable in their social circle.\n\nHowever, the person does help friends by paying their tuition, showing generosity. But the main issue is the deception in their dating approach. They admit they're only doing this to get with girls, which is a self-serving motive. While it's common for people to present their best selves, using wealth in a way that's clearly a strategy to attract others can be seen as inauthentic and manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and authenticity are valued. If someone is only pursuing others because of their money, that's a problem. But here, the person isn't necessarily seeking relationships for the girls' money; instead, they're using their wealth to attract attention. The problem is the inauthentic presentation. People might feel used if they find out the person was just using their wealth to impress them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person is in the wrong for being inauthentic and using their wealth as a tool in a manipulative way to attract others, which can be seen as unethical in social interactions.\n"
