I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. The person is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family, using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's been doing this for a year, dressing better, driving nicer cars, and talking about his dad's business. He claims he's a different person with his friends, helping them with tuition and being more down-to-earth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The main issue is whether using wealth to attract women is inherently wrong. On one hand, people have the right to use their resources as they see, and if someone is interested in a partner because of their financial status, that's their choice. But on the other hand, some might argue that it's manipulative or that it reduces relationships to material value. \n\nThe author mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates, which he sees as a reason to use his wealth as a tool. This could be seen as a way to level the playing field, but it might also come off as inauthentic. The friend's reaction\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014raises a social concern. Even if it's not illegal or unethical in a strict sense, the social judgment here is negative. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's being two-faced (different behavior with friends vs. with potential partners) could be a point against him. The question is whether this duality is a problem. If relationships are built on honesty and mutual respect, then using wealth as a lure without genuine intentions might be problematic. However, if the women he's attracting are aware of his wealth and are okay with that, maybe it's not wrong from their perspective. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The key factors are intent and the impact on others. If he's being transparent about his intentions and the women are equally clear about their own, then it's a mutual choice. However, if he's deceiving or leading others on with false pretenses, that's a different story. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're seeking a second opinion. I should consider whether the act of using wealth for social advantage is inherently wrong, or if it's a personal strategy that others might disapprove of but isn't unethical. The friend's shock suggests that societal norms might frown upon this approach, even if it's not illegal. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical judgment depends on perspective. If the women are aware and consenting, it's a personal choice. But if there's an element of deception or exploitation, that could tip the scales. The author's own admission that he's \"a huge douche\" and the social backlash from the friend indicate that there's a moral judgment here, even if it's not a legal one. So, I might lean towards the author being in the wrong from a social/ethical standpoint, but not necessarily a legal one.\n"
