I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 22-year-old wealthy guy is using his money and social media to attract girls by showcasing his wealth, dressing better, driving nice cars, etc. He's also helping his friends pay tuition and acts more normally with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Is it wrong to use wealth to attract romantic partners? People have different opinions on this. Some might argue that it's manipulative or inauthentic, while others might say it's just a game people play. The key point here is that the author is being honest with the girls about his lifestyle, at least through his social media posts, which they might be attracted to. However, the question is whether he's being deceptive. If he's not lying about who he is, maybe it's not inherently wrong.\n\nThen there's the part where he told a friend about his strategy. The friend was shocked and called him an asshole. That's a red flag. If he's bragging about using his wealth to attract girls, even if it's not a lie, it might come off as arrogant or disrespectful. Also, the fact that he's different around his friends versus when he's trying to attract girls could imply that he's being inauthentic in general, which might be seen as a problem.\n\nThe author claims that other than this, he's a normal guy and helps his friends. That might weigh in his favor, but the main issue is the method he's using. Using wealth to attract partners isn't illegal, but it's a matter of ethics. Some people might think it's okay because everyone uses their assets (looks, intelligence, etc.) to attract others. Others might see it as shallow or exploiting the other person's interest in his money.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's a trust fund kid and not good-looking adds context. He's using what he has, which is wealth, to compensate for what he feels is a lack in other areas. But does that make it wrong? It's a personal choice, but if he's being honest about his intentions and the girls are aware of that, maybe it's not the worst. However, if he's leading them on without genuine interest, that's problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She found out he was using a strategy to attract girls, which she didn't expect. Maybe she felt he was being manipulative. But the author says he's a different person with his friends, so maybe the strategy is just a tactic for dating, not a reflection of his true self. But the line between strategy and inauthenticity is thin here.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily violating any laws, but the ethical judgment depends on perspectives. If he's being honest about his lifestyle and the girls are interested, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But using wealth to attract partners might be seen as unethical by some because it could imply he's using them, especially if he's not genuine in his intentions. The fact that he told a friend and she was shocked suggests that his actions are perceived as inauthentic or manipulative, which could place him in the wrong.\n"
