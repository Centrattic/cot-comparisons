I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 22-year-old who uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He's honest with his friends about this strategy and even helps some financially. His friend called him an asshole after he admitted to this approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The person is using his money to gain attention, which isn't inherently wrong. People often use their resources to enhance their social standing or attract partners. However, the question is about whether this makes him an asshole. \n\nHe's upfront with his friends, so maybe the issue is in the method rather than the intent. Using social media to show off wealth to attract attention isn't illegal or unethical per se. But some might argue it's superficial or inauthentic. On the other hand, he's contributing to his friends' tuition and behaves differently when not showing off, which could balance out his actions. \n\nIs it wrong to use your resources to your advantage? In dating, people often highlight their best traits. His approach is just leveraging his wealth as a tool. However, the friend's reaction suggests that others might see it as manipulative or arrogant. But unless he's actively misleading about his intentions or lying, it's more about personal ethics. \n\nAlso, he doesn't force anyone to be with him; the girls are approaching him. So he's not exploiting them, just using a strategy to get noticed. The friend's judgment is subjective. The author's actions don't harm others directly, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might see it as using money as a crutch, which could be frowned upon. \n\nI think the key points are: he's honest with friends, not harming anyone, and the girls are interested. The friend's disapproval is based on personal values, but unless there's a direct wrongdoing, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
