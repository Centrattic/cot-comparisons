I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's using his wealth to attract women through social media by showing off his condo, cars, watches, trips, etc. He also changes his behavior to appear more successful, like talking about his dad's business. He's been doing this for a year, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The main points are: using wealth to attract women, being deceptive about his lifestyle, and the friend's reaction. The key issue is whether manipulating one's image to find romantic partners is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, people often present idealized versions of themselves online, so maybe it's not unethical. However, if he's being dishonest about his intentions or his true self just to get attention, that could be problematic. The fact that he's a different person with his friends suggests he's aware of the duality. \n\nAnother angle is consent and respect. If the women he interacts with are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for that reason, maybe it's mutual. But if he's misrepresenting himself, that could be deceptive. Also, using money to attract partners can be seen as objectifying others, though the question is whether the women are equally objectifying him by valuing his wealth.\n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, which is subjective. Some might argue that it's his choice how he dates, as long as no one is harmed. Others might see it as using others for material gain. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. If he's only interested in getting girls by showing off money and not being authentic, that could lead to inauthentic relationships. However, if the women are also after his wealth, it's a mutual exchange. \n\nThe user himself says he's a normal guy when with friends, so maybe he's not malicious, but using a strategy. The question is whether the ends justify the means. The AITA community often looks at whether there's harm done. Since the women might be aware of his status and choose to engage, maybe there's no harm. But if he's leading them on with false pretenses, that's different.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether deception is involved. If he's not lying about his wealth but is selective in what he shares, it's more about personal choice. But if he's lying about his intentions or other aspects of his life, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention lies, just selective presentation. So in that case, it's a matter of personal ethics. The friend's judgment is harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
