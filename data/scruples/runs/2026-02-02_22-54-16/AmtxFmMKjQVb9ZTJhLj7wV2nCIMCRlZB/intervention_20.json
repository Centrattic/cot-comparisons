I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The situation is that the author is a trust fund kid who uses social media to show off his wealth, leading to DMs from \"hot girls.\" He's also helping friends pay tuition and acts normally with them. A friend was shocked when he revealed his tactics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just showcasing it. However, using money as a primary means to attract people might be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. But is it inherently wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, people have different ways of presenting themselves, and if he's honest about his intentions, maybe it's not his fault. On the other hand, some might argue that reducing attraction to material display is shallow.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is frowned upon. But the author is also generous with his friends, which complicates the judgment. The key points are honesty and consent. If the girls are aware they're being approached because of his wealth, but he's not lying or exploiting them, maybe it's not wrong. However, if the approach is deceitful or leads to shallow relationships, that could be an issue. The author's own admission that he uses this tactic only to get with girls might imply a lack of genuine connection, which could be ethically questionable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since there's no harm explicitly mentioned to the girls, and it's about personal choice in dating, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. But the use of social media to bait attention is a common critique in modern dating contexts. Hmm.\n"
