I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, a 22-year-old man with a trust fund, uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He also mentions that he behaves differently when he's with his friends, who aren't wealthy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract romantic attention. On one hand, people might argue that everyone has different ways to present themselves, and if someone is using their resources to gain attention, that's their choice. On the other hand, there's the aspect of authenticity. If he's insincere or only using his wealth to manipulate others' interest, that could be seen as inauthentic or even exploitative.\n\nThen there's the part about his friend being shocked and calling him an asshole. That suggests that some people might view his approach as deceptive or shallow. The author is being upfront with his friends, which is good, but the question is whether the method itself is wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he helps two friends with tuition shows he's not entirely self-centered. But the main issue is the use of wealth to attract girls. Is that inherently wrong? It depends on perspectives. Some might say it's just a game and if he's honest about his intentions, it's okay. Others might see it as using money to buy affection, which isn't genuine.\n\nAnother angle is societal judgment. The AITA format often reflects common societal opinions. In many cultures, there's a stigma against using wealth to gain social advantages, especially in dating. People might perceive it as shallow or as treating others as objects. However, the author isn't being deceptive about his wealth, he's just leveraging it. So maybe the problem is the insincerity in his interactions\u2014like talking about his dad's business to impress rather than forming real connections.\n\nBut the author does mention that he's a different person when with his friends, which implies that his behavior is situational and not his true self. If he's being genuine in those moments, maybe he's not entirely inauthentic. However, in the context of dating, if he's only using his wealth to attract attention without being honest about his intentions, that's a problem. The key point is whether he's being deceptive. If he's upfront about his wealth and uses it as part of his identity, maybe it's his prerogative. But if he's pretending to be someone else, then it's insincere.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are harmful. Here, the main harm is to the girls he's attracting, but if they are aware of his wealth and choose to engage, it's their choice. However, if he's leading them on or not being genuine, that's where the issue lies. The friend's reaction suggests that the approach is seen as inauthentic and possibly disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is using his wealth in a way that might be seen as exploiting his material status for personal gain in dating, which could be considered inauthentic or manipulative. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
