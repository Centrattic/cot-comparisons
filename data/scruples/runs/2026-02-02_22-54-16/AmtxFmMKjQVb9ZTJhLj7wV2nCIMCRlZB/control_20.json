I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking whether the person is at fault for using their wealth to attract girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. So, he started showcasing his wealth on social media\u2014posting about his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he got a lot of DMs from attractive girls. He dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He does all this specifically to attract women. However, he mentions that when he's with his less wealthy friends, he's a different person, using a regular car and going to normal bars. One of his friends found out and called him an asshole for being a douche.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether using wealth to attract partners is wrong. There are a few angles here. First, authenticity in relationships: if someone is using their wealth as a tool to attract others, is that deceptive? Second, the impact on others: the author is helping his friends pay for tuition, which is a positive action. But when he's with them, he pretends to be less wealthy, which could be seen as insincere. Third, the reaction of his friend: she found out and was shocked, calling him an asshole. That suggests she perceives it as dishonest or manipulative.\n\nOn one hand, people can use their assets to enhance their social standing, but if it's a deliberate strategy to attract women without being genuine, it might be seen as inauthentic. Relationships built on such pretense could lack true connection. Also, the fact that he hides his wealth around friends might indicate he's ashamed or manipulative, which is a negative trait.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not lying about his wealth; he's just presenting it in a way that makes him more attractive in social media. People often curate their online personas to highlight certain aspects of their lives. However, using wealth as a tool to attract partners for superficial reasons could be seen as exploiting his resources, which might make others uncomfortable, especially if it's done without transparency.\n\nThe key point is intent. If his primary goal is to use wealth as a means to attract women, and he's not being genuine about his intentions, that could be problematic. The fact that he's a different person with his friends shows he's aware of the duality in his behavior. The friend's reaction also highlights the social judgment against such tactics. While it's not illegal, socially, it might be frowned upon because it can come off as inauthentic or manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they involve using wealth in a strategic, possibly deceptive way to attract partners, which could be seen as insincere and manipulative. The act of hiding his wealth around friends and presenting a different image online suggests a lack of authenticity, which can harm relationships. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
