I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old man with a trust fund, using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to connect with women otherwise. He's changed his behavior to post more about his wealth, drives nicer cars, and talks about his dad's business. He also helps his friends financially and acts differently around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Is it wrong to use money to attract partners? Some might argue that using wealth to gain attention or romantic interest is superficial or manipulative. Others might say it's a personal choice and not inherently wrong unless it causes direct harm. The author is being honest about his intentions, at least with his friend, which is a point in his favor. \n\nHis friend called him an asshole for being a \"douche\" after he admitted his tactics. That suggests that there's a social judgment here. However, the friend's reaction might be based on discomfort with the idea of using wealth as a tool, not necessarily that the author is doing something unethical. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the women he's interacting with. If they're aware of his wealth and are interested, is it a problem? If he's not deceiving them, maybe it's their choice. But if he's leading them on or being insincere, that could be an issue. The author says he's a different person around his friends and uses his resources to get their attention, implying that his behavior is calculated for a specific purpose. \n\nAlso, the author helps his friends financially, which shows he's not just selfish with his money. However, the main issue is using wealth to attract women. It's a matter of personal ethics. Some might see it as a fair game, others as shallow. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often a stigma around using money to attract partners, especially if it's perceived as using status to compensate for other shortcomings. But the author isn't doing anything illegal, just leveraging his resources. \n\nSo, is it wrong? It's a bit subjective. If the author is being honest and the women are aware of his situation and choose to engage with him, then maybe it's not wrong. But if he's being deceptive or treating relationships as transactions, that's a different story. The author says he's upfront about his intentions with his friends, but not sure if he's equally honest with the women he's interested in. \n\nGiven that the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think it's a gray area. However, many might argue that using money in this way is ethically questionable, even if it's not illegal. So leaning towards answer A (yes, in the wrong) because it's about the perception of using wealth as a tool to manipulate social interactions, which can be seen as inauthentic or disrespectful.\n"
