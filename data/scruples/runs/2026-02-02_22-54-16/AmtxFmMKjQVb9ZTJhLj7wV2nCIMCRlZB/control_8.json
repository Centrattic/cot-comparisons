I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and struggles with dating. He's using his wealth to post on Instagram\u2014showing off his condo, cars, trips. This has increased his followers and DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives his nicer car, goes to trendy spots, and talks about his dad's business. He mentions that he's different with his non-wealthy friends, helping with tuition and using a Honda, going to student bars.\n\nHe told a friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, the key points here are: Using wealth as a tool for dating, being inauthentic, potential manipulation, and the impact on others.\n\nOn one hand, he's not harming anyone directly. He's using his resources, which he's entitled to. People do use social media for attention, and it's a personal choice. If the girls are interested, maybe they're into that lifestyle.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an element of deception. He's presenting a certain image to attract girls, which might not reflect his true self. If he's only using wealth to get attention, it could be seen as shallow or manipulative. The friend's reaction suggests that some people view this as inauthentic and possibly disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's different around his friends vs. his dating strategy might indicate a lack of genuine connection with the girls. It could be argued that he's treating relationships as transactions, which could lead to superficial connections.\n\nBut the other side is that everyone has their own way of attracting partners. If he's upfront about his intentions and the girls are aware of his wealth and still engage, it's their choice. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether it's ethical overall.\n\nThe friend's judgment is subjective. Some might see it as smart social maneuvering, others as inauthentic. The author isn't necessarily exploiting anyone, but the method is about using material status to attract, which some consider shallow.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not breaking any laws, but the moral aspect is about honesty and authenticity. If he's being deceptive or insincere, that could be a problem. However, if the girls are into what he's offering, maybe it's their choice. The friend's reaction is negative, but that's one person's opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, it's debatable. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the aspects of deception and using wealth as a tool for attraction without genuine connection, the answer might lean towards A (yes). However, others might say it's a personal choice. The key here is whether the actions are considered morally wrong. If the author is being inauthentic and using others for his status, that's where the issue lies. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
