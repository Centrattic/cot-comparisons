I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not considered good-looking and finds it hard to attract women, so he started using his wealth to post luxury items on Instagram to attract attention. He mentions that he's dressing better, driving nicer cars, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. However, he's a different person with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and acting more normally. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether using wealth to attract romantic partners is unethical. There are different perspectives here. On one hand, people often present themselves in the best light possible to attract others, which is a common practice in dating. Using social media to showcase a certain lifestyle is not uncommon. However, there's a line between showing off and being genuine. The author admits that he's only doing this to get girls and is a different person when he's with his friends. That might indicate insincerity in his interactions with the women he's trying to attract. \n\nAnother point to consider is the reaction of his friend. She called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The question then becomes whether this manipulation is unethical. If the author is being deceptive about his intentions or his true self, that could be problematic. However, if he's honest and the women are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for that reason, then it's a mutual decision. But since he's using social media to create an image, it's possible that the women aren't fully aware of his true intentions or his different behavior elsewhere.\n\nEthically, the concern here is about authenticity and consent. If someone is using their wealth to attract partners under false pretenses, that could be considered morally wrong. However, if it's about self-promotion, which is common in many areas of life, then it might not be. The fact that he's helping his friends and being genuine with them shows that he has a different standard for his friends versus romantic interests. This double standard might be why his friend was upset. \n\nAlso, the act of using money to attract partners isn't inherently wrong. People date for various reasons, including financial status. However, the method by which he's doing it\u2014posting luxury items to gain attention\u2014could be seen as superficial or shallow. It's about whether he's being honest about his motivations and if the women are entering into relationships with full knowledge of his intentions. If the women are interested in his wealth and he's not hiding that, then it's a legitimate choice for them. But if he's leading them to believe he's someone he's not, then it's problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer hinges on the ethics of using wealth as a tool in dating and the level of honesty involved. If the author is being transparent about his intentions and the women are making informed choices, then it's not necessarily his fault. However, if he's being deceptive or insincere, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he's a different person with friends suggests that his interactions with the women might lack authenticity, which could be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the conclusion might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's using a strategy that's inauthentic and potentially manipulative, even if it's a common tactic.\n"
