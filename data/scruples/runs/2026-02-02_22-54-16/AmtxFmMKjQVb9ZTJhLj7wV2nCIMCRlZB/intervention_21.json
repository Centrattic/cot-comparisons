I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls, so he started using his wealth to attract them. He posts about his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram, which increased his followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He uses his nicer car and goes to trendy places to catch girls' attention, talking about his dad's business and his plans to join it. His friends aren't wealthy, and he helps pay their tuition. He behaves differently with them, using his Honda and going to student bars. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, is it wrong to use wealth to attract romantic attention? Some might say it's using money as a tool for social status or attraction, which can be seen as shallow or manipulative. Others might argue that it's just a strategy, and if someone's using their resources to their advantage, it's not inherently wrong. But there's also the aspect of honesty. The author is being open about his intentions in his posts, but when he told his friend, she was shocked. Maybe she felt he was being inauthentic or using materialism to mask his insecurities.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that using wealth in this way might be considered crass or inconsiderate. If he's not being genuine in his interactions with the girls, that could be problematic. However, the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, helping them financially and acting more modestly. This duality might be seen as two different personas, which is common, but it could also imply that he's only showing his wealthy side to attract girls, not being himself. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of using money to gain social capital. If the author is genuinely interested in forming relationships, but is using his wealth as a means to an end, it might be seen as transactional. However, if the girls are aware of his status and still engage with him, it's their choice. The issue could be more about his self-perception and the friend's judgment. \n\nThe key here is whether using wealth to attract others is inherently wrong. Societal views on this vary. Some might see it as a smart strategy, others as superficial. The fact that the author is helping his friends financially complicates things, as it shows he's not purely self-serving. But the main action in question is his approach to dating. \n\nUltimately, whether it's right or wrong depends on personal values. If the author is being honest with himself and the girls (even if it's about his wealth), and the girls are into that, then maybe it's not the worst. But if he's being deceitful or using manipulation, that's different. The author's friend's reaction is negative, but that's her perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just about the friend's opinion. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a gray area here. Using wealth to attract others isn't illegal or unethical in a strict sense, but it can be seen as shallow or inauthentic. The answer might hinge on intent and honesty. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but his approach might be problematic from a social or moral standpoint. The user's initial thought that the author isn't in the wrong is plausible, but there are arguments against it too.\n"
