I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. So he uses his wealth to post luxury items on Instagram to attract attention. He gets DMs from girls, dresses better, uses his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business. He claims he's different with his friends who aren't wealthy, helping them with tuition and acting normally with them. However, when he told one friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms and ethics. Using money to attract others can be seen as inauthentic. The author is essentially using his wealth as a tool for superficial gains in relationships, which might lack genuine connection. However, it's also about personal choice. If both parties are aware and consenting, maybe it's not wrong. But the issue here is that the author isn't being transparent with the girls he's attracting. They might be drawn in by his money but not know his real intentions. That could be manipulative.\n\nAlso, his friend's reaction suggests that she thinks it's deceitful. The fact that he's changing his behavior for different social circles might indicate hypocrisy. He's pretending to be someone else to get what he wants, which can be seen as dishonest. Relationships built on materialism might not be healthy, and the author might be using people, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his way of navigating social situations, and he's not directly lying to the girls, just being strategic. But the problem is the intent to use money as a lure, which could lead to exploitation. The key here is intent and honesty. If the girls are aware of his wealth and still engage, then maybe it's their choice. But if he's being deceptive or insincere, then it's a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, using money to attract others with the sole intention of getting into relationships without genuine connection is likely inauthentic and could be considered wrong. The author's actions might be seen as manipulative, even if he's not lying outright. So the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong).\n"
