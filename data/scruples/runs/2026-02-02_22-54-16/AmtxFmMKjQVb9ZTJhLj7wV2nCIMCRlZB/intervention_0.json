I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 22-year-old who comes from a wealthy family and is using his financial status to attract women. He's posting about his luxury items on social media to get more attention and DMs from girls. When he's with his less wealthy friends, he's more down-to-earth. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. People often use various tactics to gain attention, whether it's through looks, charm, or material possessions. The key here is intent. The author is upfront about doing this to get with girls, which might come off as manipulative to some. However, others might argue that it's a game people play in social settings.\n\nThen there's the reaction from his friend. She's shocked and calls him an asshole, which suggests she sees his actions as dishonest or inauthentic. But the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, so maybe he's being genuine in those interactions. The question is whether the use of wealth for social advantage is unethical.\n\nAnother angle is consent and transparency. The women he interacts with might be aware of his status and still choose to engage with him. There's no indication he's lying about his wealth, just that he's showcasing it. However, if he's presenting himself as someone he's not (like pretending to be more successful or using his dad's business as a conversation topic when he's not actually involved), that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, consider cultural context. In some societies, displaying wealth is a common way to attract partners. But in others, it might be seen as shallow or materialistic. The author's actions might be viewed differently based on societal norms.\n\nEthically, the issue hinges on manipulation. If he's using his wealth to gain an unfair advantage without being deceptive, it's a matter of personal ethics. Some might say it's his right to use his resources to enhance social interactions. Others might argue it's using a privilege to gain attention that others without such wealth can't, which could be seen as exploiting a system.\n\nThe author also helps his friends financially, which shows a different side of him. This could balance out his actions, but it doesn't necessarily negate the criticism from his friend. The key here is whether the strategy is considered inauthentic. If he's being two-faced, that's where the problem might lie. But if he's just adapting his behavior to different social contexts, it's a matter of personal choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether being strategic about one's social presence is considered wrong. Since the author isn't outright lying and is transparent with his friends, some might say he's not in the wrong. However, others might see the use of wealth as a tool for attracting partners as superficial or inauthentic, which could be seen as unethical.\n"
