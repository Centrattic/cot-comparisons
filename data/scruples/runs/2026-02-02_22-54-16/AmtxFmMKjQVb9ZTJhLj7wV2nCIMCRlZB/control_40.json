I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started posting his wealth on social media, which increased his followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He uses his cars, condo, trips, etc., to catch attention, talks about his dad's business, and so on. He mentions he's different with his friends, helping them with tuition and driving a Honda with them. Told a friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole. Now, the user wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using money to attract partners could be seen as superficial or objectifying, but the author claims it's just a tactic to get dates. The key here is whether manipulating social media and wealth to attract girls is inherently wrong. \n\nOn one hand, people use various strategies to attract others\u2014flattery, dressing a certain way, showing off hobbies, etc. Wealth is just another resource. The author isn't lying about his financial status; he's being honest about his situation. Also, he's contributing to friends by paying their tuition, which shows he has a giving side. If he's not being deceptive in the relationships (assuming he's upfront about his intentions), maybe it's not unethical. People have different preferences, and if the girls are into his lifestyle, then it's mutual.\n\nOn the other hand, using money to lure people might be considered manipulative. It could imply that he's using materialism to attract partners, which might not be genuine. The fact that his friend was shocked suggests that even if it's not illegal, it's socially frowned upon. Also, the author admits he's a \"huge douche\" during these interactions, which might indicate he's aware he's acting inauthentically. \n\nAnother angle: consent and transparency. If the girls are aware of his financial status and choose to engage with him because of it, then it's consensual. However, if he's presenting a false persona (e.g., pretending to be someone he's not), that's different. The author says he's being himself in terms of his wealth but is \"a different person\" with friends. So maybe he's compartmentalizing his identity, which could be seen as inauthentic but not necessarily wrong.\n\nThe question is whether using money to attract partners is inherently wrong. If someone uses their intelligence, humor, or other traits, it's acceptable. Using wealth is similar. However, some might argue that it's exploiting socioeconomic status, which can be problematic. But unless there's coercion or deception, it's hard to label it as wrong. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a social judgment, but societal approval isn't the same as moral rightness. The author isn't harming anyone directly; the relationships are consensual. The issue might be more about self-awareness and personal values. The author himself feels like a \"douche,\" which points to internal conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while the method might be seen as superficial or inauthentic, unless there's deception or harm involved, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of personal ethics and how one views the use of personal resources in social interactions.\n"
