I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in the story is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and acting a certain way when he wants to meet them. But when he's with his friends, he behaves more normally and even helps them financially. The key points here are the intent behind his actions and the impact on others.\n\nFirst, the author's main goal is to attract girls using his wealth. He's being inauthentic by putting on a facade of luxury. The problem here might be that he's using materialism as a tool for attention and romantic connections, which can be seen as manipulative. People generally value genuine connections, and if someone is only interested in a relationship for superficial reasons, that can be problematic.\n\nHowever, when he's with his friends, he's not using his wealth in the same way. He's being more genuine there, even helping them financially. That shows he's not entirely inauthentic, just in specific situations. The issue arises when he's open about using wealth to get girls, especially after spilling the beans to a friend who was shocked. The friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is viewed negatively, possibly because it's seen as shallow or transactional.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. Using money to attract partners might be considered inconsiderate or self-serving. Relationships are built on mutual respect and genuine connection, not material displays. While it's not illegal, it's socially frowned upon because it can lead to insincere relationships where the woman's interest is based on his wealth rather than his true self. This could lead to hurt feelings if the women realize the intent is just to get with them for his own gain.\n\nThe author isn't harming anyone directly, but the deception involved in maintaining two different personas (the wealthy socialite vs. the normal friend) could lead to complications. If the women he's interested in find out he's using them, they might feel used. The fact that he's honest with his friends but not with the women he's trying to attract is a point against him. Deception in any form can be a moral issue, even if it's not malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, people often use their strengths to attract others. If someone is good-looking, they might use their appearance. The author is using his wealth, which is a personal asset. The question is whether using wealth in this way is inherently wrong. Some might argue it's his prerogative to use his resources as he sees fit, especially in a society that often values material success. However, others might see it as manipulative and lacking in authenticity.\n\nThe friend's shock indicates that the author's actions cross a social line. The friend's reaction is important because it shows the perception from others. Even if the author isn't malicious, the impact of his actions on others' perceptions matters. The author's behavior could be seen as dishonest, not just because he's using money, but because he's presenting a false image. This could lead to superficial relationships that lack depth.\n\nIn conclusion, the key factors are the intent to use wealth as a tool for attraction, the inauthenticity of his persona, and the potential for insincere relationships. While it's not illegal or harmful in a physical sense, the ethical judgment hinges on the value of authenticity in relationships. Since the author is being deceptive and using materialism as a means to an end, many would argue he's in the wrong. The answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
