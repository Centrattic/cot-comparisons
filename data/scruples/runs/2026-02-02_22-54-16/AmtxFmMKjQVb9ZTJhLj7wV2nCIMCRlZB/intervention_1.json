I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and in real life. He's also helping his friends pay tuition and acts differently with them. His friend called him an asshole after he confessed his strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are morally wrong. The user is being honest about his intentions to attract girls by leveraging his wealth. Some might see this as using money to manipulate or impress others, which can be seen as inauthentic or exploitative. However, others might argue that everyone uses their assets to some extent in social settings, and it's a personal choice. \n\nThe key points are: he's transparent with his friends about his methods, he's not harming anyone directly, and he's supporting friends financially. But the method of using wealth to attract partners might be problematic in terms of honesty and authenticity in relationships. If he's upfront about his intentions with the girls he's trying to attract, it might be one thing, but if he's misleading them, that's different. The question doesn't specify if the girls are aware of his tactics, which is a gray area. \n\nHis friend's reaction is judgmental, but that's her opinion. The main issue is whether the author's actions cross an ethical line. While it's not illegal, it could be considered using his wealth to gain social advantages, which some might find unfair or shallow. However, since it's a personal choice and not causing direct harm, the answer might be more nuanced. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's not doing anything illegal, but there's a moral debate here about authenticity in relationships. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Since the question asks if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on common moral standards.\n"
