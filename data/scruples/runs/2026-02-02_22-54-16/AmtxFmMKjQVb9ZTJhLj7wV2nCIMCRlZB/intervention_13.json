I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that a guy from a wealthy family is using his money to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media and in his lifestyle. He mentions he's not good-looking and finds it hard to connect otherwise. He tells one of his friends about his strategy, and she calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is being honest about his intentions to use his wealth to attract girls. Is that inherently wrong? People might argue that using material possessions to gain attention isn't genuine and could be seen as manipulative. On the other hand, he's not lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it more. It's a matter of personal choice in how one presents themselves.\n\nHe also helps his friends pay tuition and acts normally around them, which shows he's not a bad person overall. The friend's reaction is negative, but her judgment might stem from her own values. The key here is whether the author's actions harm others. Since the girls are initiating DMs and he's not coercing anyone, maybe it's a matter of personal strategy rather than wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is authenticity. If the author is only interested in girls for their attraction and using wealth as a tool, is that fair to the girls involved? They might be attracted to the lifestyle, not the real him. But again, it's their choice to engage with him. The author isn't forcing them; he's being upfront about his approach, albeit in his own mind. The question is whether it's acceptable to use wealth as a means to an end in this context.\n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. Some might say it's using money inauthentically, while others see it as leveraging assets one has. The author isn't harming anyone directly, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The friend's judgment is her opinion, but the author isn't violating any laws or causing direct harm. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
