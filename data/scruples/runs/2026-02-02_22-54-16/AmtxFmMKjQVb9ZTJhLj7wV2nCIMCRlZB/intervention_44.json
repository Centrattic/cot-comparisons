I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family, using his money and status to attract girls by showing off his stuff on social media. He's dressing better, using his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business to impress them. He also helps his friends pay tuition and acts more normal with them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using wealth to attract romantic interest is inherently wrong. On one hand, people have the right to use their resources in any way they choose. If he's being honest about his intentions and the girls are interested because of his money, maybe that's their choice. But there's also the aspect of authenticity in relationships. If he's presenting a false image just to get girls, that could be manipulative. However, the user mentions he's different with his friends, which suggests he's not entirely fake. \n\nBut is it wrong to use wealth to gain attention? Some might argue it's not fair or respectful to the girls if they're being lured by material things rather than genuine connection. Others might say it's a personal strategy and not harmful as long as no one is harmed. The friend's reaction indicates she finds it unethical, but that's just one perspective. \n\nI need to weigh whether the actions are deceitful or if they're just honest about their tactics. The user does admit he uses this approach specifically to get girls, so maybe there's an element of manipulation. But if the girls are aware and still choose to engage, it's a mutual decision. However, if the user is misleading them about his intentions or his true self, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the user helps his friends, which shows he's not a bad person overall. But the core issue is using wealth as a tool in dating. It's a common critique in society, but whether it's \"wrong\" is subjective. Legally, it's not wrong, but morally, some might see it as exploiting one's privilege. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's using a transactional approach to relationships, which can be seen as disrespectful. But others might say it's their business and not harmful. The friend's judgment is clear, but does that make it right? It's a bit of a gray area. I think the consensus would lean towards A because it's about using money to manipulate, but the user's own perspective is that he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
