I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family who's not considered good-looking. He uses his social media to showcase his wealth\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips\u2014which increases his popularity and gets him DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. However, he's a different person with his less wealthy friends, helping them pay tuition and acting normally.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for doing this. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as using materialism to gain attention, which some might view as inauthentic or manipulative. However, the author is upfront about his tactics, at least to his friends. He's not hiding his wealth when he uses it; he's leveraging it as part of his social strategy. But is that inherently wrong? People often present their best selves or use their assets to attract others, whether it's through hobbies, looks, or money. The line might be crossed if he were being deceptive, but he's being honest about his intentions when necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that reducing one's dating prospects to materialism is shallow and not respectful to the other person. If the girls are primarily interested in his wealth rather than his personality, it could lead to superficial relationships. However, the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, which suggests he values genuine connections there. It's possible he's prioritizing different aspects of his identity in different social circles, which isn't uncommon.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She called him an asshole, indicating that his actions were perceived as inconsiderate or inauthentic. But her judgment is subjective. Others might see it as a realistic approach to social dynamics. The key is whether his actions harm anyone beyond his own authenticity. If the girls are aware of his wealth and choose to engage, it's a mutual choice. If he's not lying about his intentions, then it's a matter of personal strategy rather than deception.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize his methods as shallow or manipulative, unless he's being deceptive or causing direct harm, it's a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
