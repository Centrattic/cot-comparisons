I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and has trouble getting girls, so he started using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions dressing better, driving nicer cars, and talking about his dad's business to impress them. However, he acts differently around his friends, helping them with tuition and being more down-to-earth.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about using money as a means to attract women. On one hand, he's being transparent about his intentions and methods, and he's not harming anyone directly. He's just leveraging his resources to achieve his goals. On the other hand, some might argue that it's inauthentic or that he's objectifying the women by implying he's using his wealth to get them, which could be seen as manipulative or treating them as interested only in his money.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of personal choice. If he's not lying about who he is (he's wealthy and using that to his advantage), and if the women are genuinely interested in him, then maybe it's his right to use his assets. However, the friend's reaction suggests that some people might find his approach crass or deceptive, especially if the women aren't aware of his true intentions. But the user says he only does this to get with girls and acts differently around his friends, indicating he's aware of the difference in personas.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's ethical to use wealth to gain social advantages. Some might see it as a natural strategy, while others might consider it unfair. The fact that he's helping his non-wealthy friends financially could complicate the perception\u2014maybe he's genuinely caring in some areas but using his wealth in others for personal gain. The contradiction there might be part of why someone would call him an asshole.\n\nBut ultimately, unless he's actively deceiving the women (which isn't clear here) or causing harm, it's a matter of personal ethics. If the women are aware of his wealth and are still interested, then it's a personal choice for them. The author's actions might be seen as a bit shallow, but not necessarily \"wrong.\" The friend's judgment is subjective, and societal views on this can vary. So, depending on the ethical framework applied, the answer could swing either way. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and there's no clear harm or deception, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
