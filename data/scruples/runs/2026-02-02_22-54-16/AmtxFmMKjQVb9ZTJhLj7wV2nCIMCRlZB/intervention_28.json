I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using money and social media to attract girls. The person is a trust fund kid who posts luxury stuff online, gets DMs, and dates girls by showing off his wealth. He admits he's doing it just for that purpose and that he's different when hanging out with friends. His friend called him an asshole after he told her.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Using money to attract attention could be seen as manipulative. People might argue that it's insincere because he's not being genuine. On the other hand, maybe he's just using what he has to his advantage. But then, is it fair to the girls he dates if they're being drawn in by his wealth and not for who he really is? That could lead to problems if they find out later.\n\nAlso, his behavior of changing his image for different crowds might indicate a lack of authenticity. If he's not being honest about his intentions from the start, that's a red flag. However, if the girls are interested in the lifestyle and he's upfront about that, maybe it's their choice. But the problem arises when he's not genuine, which can lead to superficial relationships. The friend's reaction suggests that others see it as inauthentic and possibly exploitative. \n\nBut some might say that everyone uses their strengths to attract others, and money is just one aspect. The key here is whether the author is deceptive. He mentions he's being a different person when with friends, which implies he's not being genuine in his dating life. That could be where the issue lies. So, the answer depends on whether using wealth to attract partners is considered wrong. If insincerity is the main issue, then he's in the wrong because he's not being authentic. If the problem is using money, then it's a matter of opinion. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the consensus might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) communities usually find such behavior inauthentic and thus the person is in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
