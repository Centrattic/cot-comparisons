I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses their wealth to attract girls by showcasing their stuff on social media. They get DMs from girls, go to trendy places, and talk about their dad's business. They admit they're being a \"douche\" just to get with girls but act normally with friends, even helping them with tuition. When they told a friend about their strategy, she called them an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is to determine if they are. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I have to consider if using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. Some might say it's manipulative or insincere, using money to get attention rather than being genuine. Others might argue that people have different ways to attract others, and it's not illegal or harmful as long as everyone consents. The author isn't lying about their wealth; they're just highlighting it. However, the \"only doing this to get with girls\" part could be seen as using their wealth as a tool for manipulation. \n\nBut then, social media is a platform where people often showcase their best lives. The author is leveraging their resources to create an image that attracts others. The friend's reaction might indicate that the author's approach is socially frowned upon, but does that make it wrong? Also, the author helps their friends financially, which shows they're not entirely self-centered. \n\nHowever, the key issue is intent. The author is specifically using these tactics to attract girls, which others might find inauthentic. If the girls know the author is wealthy and are drawn to that, it's a matter of personal choice for the girls, but the method of attraction could be seen as exploiting one's wealth. \n\nBut is it unethical? It's not illegal, and there's no coercion. The author isn't hurting anyone, just being strategic. However, some might argue that it's a form of deception if the author is presenting a curated image that's not their genuine self in other aspects. \n\nIn the end, it's a matter of perspective. The friend sees it as wrong, but the author might believe it's a valid strategy. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. If the author isn't harming anyone and the girls are aware and interested in the wealth, then maybe not in the wrong. But if it's considered manipulative, then maybe A. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and there's no clear harm or violation of laws, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
