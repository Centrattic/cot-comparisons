I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is the asshole. The scenario involves a 22-year-old man who's wealthy and using his money and social media to attract girls. He's posting about his affluent lifestyle, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business to get attention. He also mentioned helping friends pay tuition but switching back to a more normal persona when with them. A friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Is it wrong to use one's wealth to attract romantic partners? Some might argue that it's manipulative or insincere, as he's presenting a curated image rather than his authentic self. Others might say that people have the right to use their resources as they see fit, especially if they're not lying about the existence of those resources. However, if he's intentionally misleading others about his character or intentions, that could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the issue of authenticity. If he's being a different person around girls\u2014focusing on wealth and status rather than genuine connection\u2014does that make it wrong? Relationships built on honesty and mutual respect are generally considered healthier. Using money to attract partners might lead to relationships that aren't based on real compatibility, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a clue. She was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions might be viewed negatively by others. The fact that he had to 'spill the beans' implies that he was hiding this aspect of his life, which could indicate deceit. However, if he's honest with the girls about his approach, maybe it's not so bad. But the post doesn't mention that he's transparent with the girls; instead, it's implied that he's using a strategy without disclosing his motives.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for exploitation. If the girls are being attracted solely by his wealth and not his personality, there's a risk that the relationships could be transactional. This could lead to the girls feeling used if they later realize he's only interested in them for their looks. However, the author mentions he's a \"normal guy\" otherwise and helps his friends, which might suggest he's not entirely bad, but the method here is questionable.\n\nSocial media usage is another factor. Posting curated images to attract attention is a form of self-promotion that's common, but when it's specifically to manipulate interactions, it can cross a line. The line between self-promotion and manipulation is thin here. If the girls are aware of his lifestyle and choose to engage, maybe it's their choice. But if he's using that as a tool to attract them without genuine intent, it's more problematic.\n\nThe author's justification is that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get with girls. This brings up the issue of self-esteem and using wealth to compensate. While everyone has the right to seek partners, doing so through material display might not be the healthiest approach. It could reinforce superficial values in relationships, which is a broader societal concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, his actions could be seen as manipulative and inauthentic. He's using his wealth as a tool to attract women without being transparent about his motives, which can be considered unethical. Therefore, the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
