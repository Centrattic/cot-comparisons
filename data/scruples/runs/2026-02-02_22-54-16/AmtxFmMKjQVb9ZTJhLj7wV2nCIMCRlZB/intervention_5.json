I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old wealthy man who uses his money and social media to attract women, but claims he's a different person with his friends. His friend called him an asshole after he confessed about using his wealth to get attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is using his resources intentionally to attract women by showing off his wealth on social media. He's being honest about his motives, which is to get with girls. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nArguments for AITA (A): Using money to attract women could be seen as objectifying or being a \"player.\" It might be considered manipulative or insincere, as he's presenting a curated image rather than being authentic. Also, the fact that he's a different person in different settings could be seen as hypocritical or fake. His friend's reaction supports the idea that some people view this as inconsiderate or shallow.\n\nArguments against AITA (B): The author isn't doing anything illegal. He's honest about his intentions. He's also generous with his wealth by helping friends with tuition. It's his choice how he wants to present himself to attract partners. Society often places value on material success, so this might just be a reflection of that. Additionally, he's not pressuring women; they are approaching him based on his posts.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, using wealth to attract partners is common and not inherently wrong. On the other hand, some might argue it's superficial or inauthentic. The friend's judgment is subjective. The author's actions don't harm others directly unless he's deceptive in his relationships. If the women he dates are aware of his motivations, then it's mutual. However, if he's misleading them by not being upfront, that's a different story. The post doesn't mention deception, just strategic self-presentation. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but some might still see it as shallow. The community's reaction could be mixed. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong. Considering all this, I might lean towards B, but there's a valid case for A.\n"
