I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 22-year-old guy who's using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his money on social media, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He also mentions that he helps his non-wealthy friends pay tuition and acts normally with them. After telling a friend his methods, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. The question is about morality here. Some people might argue that it's manipulative and inauthentic, while others might see it as a strategy he's using to improve his chances. The key factors here are intent and the impact on others.\n\nThe author is honest about his intentions\u2014doing this solely to get with girls. There's no mention of deception in the context of actual relationships; he's using social media and his appearance to attract attention. However, if he's not being truthful with the women he's dating, that could be a problem. But the scenario doesn't specify that he's lying to them directly. He's presenting his lifestyle, which might be seen as using his wealth to gain attention, but is that inherently wrong?\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are considered in poor taste or unethical in her view. However, friends can have different perspectives. The fact that he helps his friends financially and presents a different side with them shows he's not entirely inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue is using money as a tool for attraction. While it's not illegal, some might argue it's superficial and objectifies others, treating them as if they're only interested in wealth. Others might say it's just a strategy in the context of dating, where people often highlight their best traits. The line is thin here. The author isn't necessarily hurting anyone directly unless the women he's attracting are led to believe he's more invested than he is, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nOn the other hand, the act of using wealth to attract partners can be seen as a form of inauthenticity, which could lead to shallow relationships. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If there's no harm beyond personal ethics, it's a gray area. But the friend's judgment suggests that some people would say he is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because using wealth to attract partners can be viewed as manipulative and inauthentic, even if it's not illegal. The friend's reaction supports this, and while everyone has different dating strategies, the ethical judgment here is that prioritizing wealth as a tool for attraction is considered inappropriate by many.\n"
