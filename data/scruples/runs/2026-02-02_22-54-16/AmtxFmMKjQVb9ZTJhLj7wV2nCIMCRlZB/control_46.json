I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The story goes that the author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, using social media to showcase their wealth and meet girls. They admit it's a tactic to get attention, and they behave differently depending on the context. They also help friends financially but were honest with one friend, who then called them a douche.\n\nSo, the main question is whether this behavior is wrong. Let's break it down. The author is using their wealth as a tool to attract romantic attention. But is that inherently wrong? People often use various strategies to attract others, like fashion, hobbies, or social status. However, there's an ethical angle here. Are they being deceptive? The author is open about their intentions with their friends in different contexts, but when it comes to the girls, they present themselves in a certain way without disclosing their true motives. That could be seen as manipulative or insincere. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is notable. She called them an asshole, implying that the method of using money to attract girls is unethical. But does that mean the author is wrong? It's subjective. Some might argue that it's a personal choice and everyone has their methods. Others might see it as exploiting wealth to gain attention, which can be seen as shallow or disrespectful. The author is also being hypocritical if they claim to be a \"normal guy\" but only act that way when not trying to attract others. \n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual attraction. If the girls are aware of the author's wealth and are attracted to that, is it their choice? The author isn't forcing anyone; it's about mutual interest. However, if the author is pretending to be someone they're not to get dates, that's different. But the story says they are upfront about their dad's business and their future role, so maybe the girls are interested in that. \n\nOn the other hand, using money as a primary tool could be a red flag for the girls, indicating that the relationship is based on materialism rather than genuine connection. The author might be building superficial relationships. But again, the ethical judgment here depends on cultural norms and personal values. \n\nThe fact that the author is helping friends financially suggests they aren't just using their money for selfish reasons, but that's a separate action. The question is about the dating strategy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If they're being honest with the girls and the girls are into that, then maybe not. But if they're misleading them by presenting a wealthier lifestyle as a key part of their personality without being transparent about their true intentions, it could be seen as wrong. The friend's negative reaction adds to the idea that this approach is frowned upon. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because it's using wealth as a manipulative tool to attract others, which can be seen as insincere. However, there's a counterargument that it's a personal choice. But given the context and the friend's reaction, the consensus might be that it's unethical. So, I'll go with A.\n"
