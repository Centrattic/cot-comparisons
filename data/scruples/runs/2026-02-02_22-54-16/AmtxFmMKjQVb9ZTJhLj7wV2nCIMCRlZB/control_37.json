I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The question is whether using wealth to attract girls is unethical or not.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund. He's not good-looking and had trouble getting girls. He started posting his wealth on social media, showing off his condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he received DMs from girls. He uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, talks about his dad's business to impress girls. But when he told a friend, she called him an asshole for \"using money to get girls.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: using social media to showcase wealth, attracting attention through materialism, and the moral implications of that. The user is asking if this is wrong.\n\nI need to consider different angles. On one hand, using wealth to attract partners might be seen as superficial or manipulative. People might argue that it's inauthentic and objectifies the other person. On the other hand, the author is being honest about his motivations and isn't hiding his intentions. He's not lying directly to the girls, just using his resources to enhance his social appeal.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests she views this approach as insincere or inconsiderate. But the author mentions he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition, and being more down-to-earth. So maybe he's not a bad person overall, just using a strategy to navigate social challenges he faces.\n\nAnother angle: social media is a platform where people often curate their image. The author is leveraging that to his advantage. It's a common tactic in dating culture, though it might come off as pretentious. However, if the girls are interested because of his wealth and he's upfront about his status, perhaps he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of authenticity. If he's only interested in getting with girls through material means, maybe it's a shallow approach. Even if he's not lying, the method could be seen as transactional, which some people find off-putting.\n\nI should also think about the AITA context. Typically, AITA questions have community responses that weigh in on whether the person deserved the criticism they received. In this case, the friend's criticism is strong. The community might split, but the consensus might be that while the author isn't the worst, his actions are superficial and could be considered inconsiderate or unethical.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because using wealth to attract partners can be seen as manipulative and inauthentic, even if he's honest about his methods. However, others might argue that it's just a different approach and not inherently wrong. The friend's reaction is a key point\u2014she feels he's being an asshole, which implies that the action is socially frowned upon.\n"
