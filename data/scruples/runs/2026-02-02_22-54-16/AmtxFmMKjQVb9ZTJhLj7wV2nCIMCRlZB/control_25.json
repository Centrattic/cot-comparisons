I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family is using his money and status to attract girls on social media. He posts about his condo, cars, trips, etc., and gets a lot of messages from girls. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. He also says that when he's with his friends (who aren't wealthy), he's more normal, drives a Honda, goes to student bars, etc. He told a friend about his tactic, and she called him an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Is it wrong to use money to attract romantic attention? Some might argue that it's manipulative or inauthentic. If someone is only interested in a relationship because of another person's wealth, that could be seen as using the person for their money. But the author isn't directly offering money to the girls; he's using his wealth as a way to attract attention and build a persona that appeals to them. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author is upfront about his motives\u2014using his wealth to get with girls. But when he told a friend, she was shocked and called him an asshole. That suggests that maybe his friend didn't think it was appropriate. However, others might say that it's his own life and he's not hurting anyone as long as the girls are aware and interested. The key here is whether the girls are being deceived. If the author is presenting a curated image of himself and the girls are choosing to engage with him because of that image, but he's not lying about the core of who he is, maybe it's not deceptive. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not to get into a relationship, that's different.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of authenticity. Relationships built on superficial traits like wealth might not be sustainable or genuine. The author mentions he's a different person with his friends, which could indicate he's compartmentalizing his identity. But does that make him in the wrong? It's possible that he's being honest with the girls by showing his wealth, even if it's for ulterior motives. \n\nThe friend's reaction is another point. She called him an asshole, possibly because she found the tactic manipulative. But whether that's right depends on societal norms. Some people might see using wealth to attract partners as unethical, while others might see it as a strategic approach. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't directly harming anyone unless the girls are being misled. If the girls are aware of his status and choose to engage with him, it's their choice. However, if he's leading them to believe he's more interested in them than he is, or if he's not being truthful about his intentions, that's a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth in this way. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the method is considered deceptive. If the author is honest about his wealth and the girls are interested because of that, then maybe it's not wrong. But if he's using his wealth as a facade to hide his lack of other qualities, it could be seen as inauthentic. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) community often considers intent and potential harm. Since the author is upfront with his friends and maybe the girls, but his friend is upset, there's a case to be made that he's being inconsiderate or manipulative. However, others might say it's his way of navigating the dating world. \n\nSo, I'm torn. On one hand, using money to attract partners isn't inherently wrong; people have different standards. On the other hand, if it's a calculated strategy to manipulate others' perceptions, that's more questionable. The fact that he's a different person with friends might suggest he's aware of the duality. Since the friend called him an asshole, but others might disagree, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) or B (he's not). \n\nIn the end, I think the author is in the wrong because he's using his wealth as a tool to attract people, which can be seen as inauthentic and potentially exploitative. Even if the girls are into it, the method might be considered unethical. So the answer is A.\n"
