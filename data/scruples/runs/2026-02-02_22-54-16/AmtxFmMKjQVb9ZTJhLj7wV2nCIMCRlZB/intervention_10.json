I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses social media to showcase his wealth, which gets him attention from women. He mentions that he's not good-looking and it's hard for him to get girls otherwise. He also helps his friends by paying their tuition and acts normally with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is being honest about his tactic. He's not lying about who he is when interacting with the girls; he's just leveraging his resources. But some might argue that using wealth to attract people is manipulative or inauthentic. On the other hand, he's not physically or emotionally harming anyone. It's about personal choices in dating.\n\nThen there's the friend's reaction. She called him an asshole for being upfront about his method. But the author didn't lie to the girls; he just uses his social media presence as a way to meet people. Is it wrong to use one's advantages? Everyone has different ways to approach dating, and this might be his way given his insecurities about his looks.\n\nAlso, the author is helping his friends financially, which shows he's not just self-serving. He's a different person around them, which suggests he's genuine in those relationships. The key here is whether his actions towards the girls are deceitful. Since he's honest about his intentions when talking to the girls and isn't pretending to be someone else, maybe it's not wrong.\n\nBut some might say that using wealth to attract partners is shallow and objectifies people, assuming the girls are only interested in his money. However, the author isn't forcing anyone; the girls are choosing to engage with him. It's a mutual choice. The problem might be more about societal perceptions rather than an actual wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's being upfront about his strategy and isn't misleading anyone. It's a matter of personal ethics and how one perceives the use of wealth in dating. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
