I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The question is whether using wealth to attract romantic attention is unethical.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not considered good-looking, so he uses his wealth to post about his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram to attract women. He mentions that he's been doing this for a year, and it's worked, getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also says he changes his behavior\u2014dressing better, driving his nicer car\u2014to catch their attention. He talks about his dad's business and his future involvement in it. He's different with his friends, helping them pay tuition and acting more normally, using a Honda and going to student bars. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole or a douche.\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether using wealth strategically to attract romantic partners is wrong. There are a few angles to consider. Ethically, people often frown upon using money to manipulate others, especially in romantic contexts. It could be seen as insincere or treating others as means to an end. Manipulating one's image to appear more desirable by showcasing wealth can be deceptive if the person is not genuine in their intentions or if they're not honest about their motivations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that people present themselves in the best light possible on social media. Everyone has certain traits they highlight to attract others. If the author is honest about his background and uses his wealth to enhance his self-presentation, it might not be inherently wrong. However, if he's being deceptive or if his actions lead to superficial relationships, that's a problem.\n\nThe key here is the intent. The author admits he's doing this \"only to get with girls,\" which suggests a focus on appearance and materialism. This can come off as shallow or inauthentic, especially if the relationships are based on his wealth rather than genuine connection. The friend's reaction indicates that this approach is seen as unethical or inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, which implies he's aware of this duality. Helping friends pay for tuition and acting normally in their presence shows he's not entirely inauthentic. However, the strategy of using wealth to attract romantic attention is problematic because it's about manipulation rather than genuine interest in others.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, deontological ethics would focus on the action itself\u2014using money to manipulate others is inherently wrong. Utilitarianism might look at the consequences: if it's making others feel used or leading to mistrust, then the consequences are negative. Virtue ethics would consider the character; being inauthentic and manipulative isn't a virtuous trait.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author is likely in the wrong. He's using his wealth in a way that could be seen as manipulative and insincere, which is generally frowned upon in romantic relationships. The friend's reaction supports this. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
