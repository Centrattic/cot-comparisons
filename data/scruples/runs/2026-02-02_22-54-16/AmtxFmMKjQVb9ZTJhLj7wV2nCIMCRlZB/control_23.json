I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He's honest with his friends about it, but one friend called him an asshole for it. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The guy is using his money to gain attention from women, which might be seen as superficial or manipulative. But he's not lying about his wealth, right? He's just highlighting it. However, the intention is solely to get girls, which could be seen as objectifying them or using them for his own benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being open with his friends. When one of them asks, he tells the truth. He's also helping his friends by paying their tuition, which might balance out his actions. He behaves differently around them, driving a regular car and going to normal places. So there's a contrast in his behavior depending on the company.\n\nIs it wrong to use your resources to attract others? In some cultures, showing off wealth might be frowned upon, but it's not illegal. However, the intent to use wealth as a tool to attract people can be seen as inauthentic. The friend's reaction suggests she thinks he's being insincere or manipulative, which could damage relationships. \n\nBut the key here is whether he's being deceptive. If he's upfront with the women he's approaching, then it's not exactly wrong. The problem arises if he's misleading them. The post doesn't mention deception, just that he's using his wealth as a means to attract. So maybe the issue is more about the method rather than the honesty. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping his friends financially shows he's not entirely self-centered. However, using wealth to attract romantic partners might still be considered unethical if it's a transactional approach, treating others as means to an end. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. But generally, being transparent and not lying isn't wrong, but using wealth to manipulate or attract without genuine intent could be seen as unethical. Hence, the author might be in the wrong because he's using his wealth strategically to gain attention, which could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, even if he's honest with his friends.\n"
