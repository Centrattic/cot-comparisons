I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old wealthy guy who uses his money and social media to attract girls. He posts about his luxury items, dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He mentions that he's not good-looking and this approach works. He also helps his friends financially but when he told one about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is using his resources to attract romantic attention. There's nothing inherently illegal or unethical about that. People often use their assets to improve their social or romantic prospects. However, there's a moral aspect here. Is he being deceptive? He's being honest with the girls about his wealth, maybe, but he's presenting himself in a way that might not reflect his true personality. But the post says he's a different person when he's with his friends, not using his wealth. So maybe he's compartmentalizing his behavior.\n\nThe key point is whether using wealth to attract others is morally wrong. Some might argue that it's manipulative or using money as a tool for vanity, which is unethical. Others might say it's just a strategy and not inherently wrong, as people use different tactics in dating. However, if he's being insincere or pretending to be someone he's not to get girls, that could be seen as deceptive. The fact that he's open about his wealth (posting it on social media) might mean it's not a lie, but the intent to use it solely for romantic purposes could be considered shallow or self-serving.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that she found it unethical, calling him an asshole. But friends' opinions can vary. The author isn't harming anyone directly; the girls might be aware of his wealth and still be interested. Unless there's a betrayal of trust or deception, it's hard to say he's wrong. However, using wealth to compensate for other insecurities (like not being good-looking) might be seen as a superficial approach, but that's subjective.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether others are harmed. If the girls aren't being lied to and are into his lifestyle, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being fake, it's a problem. The author mentions he's a different person with friends, which implies he's not being his true self with the girls, which could be seen as inauthentic. That might be the issue. So, there's a case for A (he's in the wrong) because he's using a strategy that's inauthentic and potentially manipulative. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because it's his choice how to present himself, and there's no harm done unless he's lying.\n"
