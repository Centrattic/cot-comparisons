I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his assets on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, changing his behavior specifically to attract women. He also helps his friends financially but acts differently around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative or insincere if the intent is solely to get dates. The author admits he's only doing this to get with girls, which suggests a lack of authenticity. But is that inherently wrong? People might have different opinions on that.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. He told a friend about his strategy, and she was shocked, calling him an asshole. That reaction indicates that his actions might be viewed negatively by others, even those close to him. The friend's judgment could be a key point here. If the author's actions make others feel he's inauthentic or using his wealth inappropriately, that might support the argument that he's wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his personal life and he's not hurting anyone as long as the women are aware of his intentions. If the women are interested because of his wealth and he's upfront about it, maybe there's no harm. But the problem is, he doesn't mention whether he's transparent with the women. It seems he's using a facade to attract them, which could lead to deception if the women aren't aware of his true motives.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on relationships. If he's only interested in using his wealth to attract partners, that could lead to shallow relationships. However, if he's successful in forming connections, even if they're based on wealth, some might say it's his choice. But the fact that he's acting differently when around his non-wealthy friends suggests he's aware of different social personas, which might imply he's inauthentic even in other aspects of his life.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is significant. Her shock and labeling him an asshole suggest that his actions go against social norms or expectations of honesty and authenticity in relationships. If someone uses wealth to manipulate or attract others without being genuine, that's often frowned upon.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions can be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, using his wealth as a tool to attract women without genuine intent. The friend's negative reaction and the potential for deception support the idea that he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
