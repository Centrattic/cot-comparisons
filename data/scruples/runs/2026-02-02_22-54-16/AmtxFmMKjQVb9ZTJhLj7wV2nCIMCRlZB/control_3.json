I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media and acting a certain way to impress them. He also helps his non-wealthy friends financially but keeps his dating strategy hidden. When he revealed his methods to a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his money to attract partners, which some might see as using superficial traits. However, there's no explicit deception here about his intentions or his wealth. He's honest in his approach, though maybe manipulative in the sense of curating a certain image.\n\nThen there's the part about his friends. He supports them financially, which is good, but when he revealed his strategy to a friend, her reaction was negative. The key here is whether using wealth for dating is inherently wrong. Some people might argue that it's fair game if both parties are aware and consenting. However, if the women are being attracted solely by material things without knowing his primary motive is to get with them, that could be a problem. The author doesn't mention if the women are aware of his intentions beyond his wealth, which could affect their consent.\n\nAlso, the author's behavior with friends versus his dating strategy shows a double standard. He presents himself differently in different social contexts, which might be insincere. The friend's reaction suggests that the method is seen as inauthentic or using others for personal gain.\n\nSocial media manipulation is another angle. By curating his online presence to attract attention, he's being strategic but maybe not transparent. However, social media is often a platform for self-presentation, so it's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author isn't breaking any laws, but ethical standards vary. If the women are into the lifestyle and the relationship is consensual, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's leading them on with the expectation that his wealth is the main attraction without being upfront, that's a different story.\n\nThe friend's judgment is based on her perception, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the act of using wealth to attract partners can be seen as transactional, which some find objectionable. The author's self-awareness that he sounds like a \"huge douche\" indicates he's aware of the potential criticism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions aren't illegal, they can be ethically questionable depending on the intent and the awareness of all parties involved. The deception or manipulation aspect, if present, would make him wrong. Since the women might not be fully aware of his motives and he's exploiting his wealth to manipulate perceptions, the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong).\n"
