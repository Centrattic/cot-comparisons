I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who uses his wealth to attract girls by posting luxury items on Instagram and then engaging with them. He's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and finds it hard to connect otherwise. He's helping his friends financially but presents himself differently around them. He told one of them his method, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Is he being deceptive? He's using his wealth as a tool to attract attention, which is a form of manipulation. People might argue that using social media to project a certain image isn't inherently wrong, but when it's solely for the purpose of getting dates, that's where the line might be crossed. The key point is whether he's being honest about his intentions with the girls he's trying to attract.\n\nAlso, when he told his friend, she was shocked. That suggests that his actions might be seen as disingenuous or inauthentic. Even if he's helping friends financially, his behavior towards the girls he's interested in is different. This could be seen as using people for his own benefit without genuine connection.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The girls might be aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him because of that. However, if they're not aware that his interest is solely for their appearance or that he's presenting a curated image, then there's an issue of honesty. But the story doesn't specify if the girls know his motivations or if they're equally interested.\n\nThere's also the aspect of self-worth. The guy feels he needs to use his wealth because he's not attractive, which touches on deeper issues of self-esteem. However, that doesn't necessarily justify his actions. People have different dating strategies, but using materialism as a primary tool might be frowned upon socially.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent, harm caused, and authenticity. If the guy is being deceptive, then he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his approach and the girls are okay with it, maybe not. The story doesn't mention if the girls are aware of his tactics, but the fact that he's changing his behavior to attract them suggests a level of inauthenticity. Plus, his friend's reaction indicates that his method is seen as unethical by some standards.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the consensus might lean towards AITA (Author Is The Asshole) because he's using wealth to manipulate situations for his benefit without genuine intent, which can be considered deceitful and inauthentic.\n"
