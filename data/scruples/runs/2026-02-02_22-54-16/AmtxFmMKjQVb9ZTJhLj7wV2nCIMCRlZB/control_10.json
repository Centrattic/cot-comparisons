I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a 22-year-old man who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started using social media to show off his condo, cars, watches, and trips, which increased his followers and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls\". He dresses better, drives his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress girls. He mentions he's helping friends with tuition but acts normally with them, using his own car and going to student bars. He told a friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract romantic attention. This raises questions about authenticity and manipulation. He's presenting a certain image of himself that's not his everyday behavior. When he's with friends, he's more down-to-earth, but when he's trying to meet girls, he's showcasing his wealth. \n\nIs using wealth to attract partners inherently wrong? Some people might argue that it's not wrong to use what you have to your advantage, especially if you're not lying outright. However, if he's being deceptive about who he is\u2014like pretending to be a different person just for the sake of attracting girls\u2014that could be considered insincere or manipulative. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that others might view his approach as inappropriate. The fact that he's changing his behavior based on the audience (friends vs. potential partners) might indicate a lack of authenticity. \n\nAnother angle is whether the girls are aware that he's using them for their appearance in exchange for his wealth. If they're into him for his money, it's a transactional relationship, but if he's using his wealth to manipulate their interest without genuine intent, that could be problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the girls' intentions. \n\nAlso, the author is being honest with his friends about his strategy, which shows he's aware that his actions might be seen as inauthentic. The friend's negative response reinforces that others see it as a bad move. \n\nIn terms of ethics, using wealth to attract others might not be illegal, but it can be seen as morally questionable if it's done with the sole intent of manipulation. The key here is the intent and the impact on others. The author is being inauthentic, which can lead to shallow relationships and potentially hurt others' feelings if they later find out they were only being courted for his wealth. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using manipulation and inauthenticity to achieve his goals, which can be considered unethical.\n"
