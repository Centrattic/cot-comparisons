I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family, part of a trust fund. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls. A year ago, he started a strategy of posting his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. His followers increased, and he gets a lot of DMs from \"hot girls\" saying hi. Now he dresses better, uses his nicer car more, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business and his future plans to join it. He admits he sounds like a \"huge douche\" but clarifies that he only does this to attract girls. Otherwise, he's a normal guy, and his friends aren't wealthy. He helps two of them pay their tuition and acts differently when he's with them, using his Honda and going to student bars. Recently, he told one of his friends about this strategy after she asked how he attracts such hot girls, and she was shocked, calling him the biggest asshole/douche in the city. The question is whether he's in the wrong, with options A (yes) and B (no).\n\nHmm. So the key points here are using wealth as a way to attract women, being deceptive about his lifestyle, and then revealing this to a friend who was upset. The user is asking if they're the a**hole. \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of using money to attract people. Is it wrong to use one's wealth to attract women? That's a bit subjective. Some might say that it's not inherently wrong because people have different preferences. If someone is into wealth, then the author is just catering to that. But others might argue that it's manipulative or insincere if the author is pretending to be more interested in the business or lifestyle than he actually is. \n\nThen there's the part about dressing better and using his nicer car. Is that deceptive? If he's actually wealthy and can afford those things, maybe not. But if he's pretending to be wealthier than he is, that's different. The author says he's not good-looking, so maybe he's trying to compensate with material things. However, he clarifies that he's a different person with his friends, using his Honda and going to student bars, and helps pay their tuition. This suggests that he's acting a certain way around girls but being genuine with friends. The friend who found out was shocked and upset, which adds a layer of betrayal or perhaps disapproval of his tactics.\n\nI need to think about the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the A**hole). The community usually looks for whether the person's actions are clearly in the wrong, causing harm, or being insincere. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women through social media, which could be seen as exploiting his status or being inauthentic. However, if all parties are aware and consenting (the girls aren't necessarily being misled, just attracted by his posts), maybe it's not the worst. But the part where he's acting differently when he's not with them might imply that he's being two-faced. When he told his friend, her reaction was negative, suggesting that she finds this behavior unethical or shallow. \n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author is upfront about his goal being to get with girls, which could be seen as transactional. If the girls are just responding to his posts because they like his wealth, then the relationships formed might be based on materialism rather than genuine connection. That could be problematic. However, as long as he's not lying about his intentions in the interactions, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's leading them on with false pretenses, that's another issue. \n\nThe friend's reaction also matters. She might perceive it as inauthentic or arrogant, hence calling him an a**hole. The author's friends aren't wealthy, so when he's with them, he's not showcasing his wealth. This could indicate that he's using his wealth as a facade when interacting with girls, which might be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't necessarily lying about his wealth; he is from a wealthy family. He's just curating his image to appeal to a certain audience. The question is whether that's acceptable. Social media is often about curation, so maybe it's not wrong. But the act of using money to attract women in a way that feels inauthentic or transactional might still be frowned upon. \n\nAlso, the author is helping his friends with tuition, which shows he's not entirely selfish. However, that's separate from his approach with women. The main issue is whether his methods are wrong. \n\nIn summary, the author is using his wealth to attract women through social media by showcasing his lifestyle and changing his behavior. He's being deceptive in his interactions, perhaps leading girls to believe he's more into the lifestyle or business than he is, but he's not lying about his wealth. The friend's disapproval is a red flag, but it's not clear if the girls are aware of his tactics. If the relationships are based on manipulation or falsified intentions, then he might be in the wrong. If it's just a matter of personal preference and he's honest about his approach, it's debatable. However, since he's using a facade to attract people, which can lead to inauthentic connections, the community might lean towards AITA because it's about using money to manipulate perceptions for romantic gain.\n"
