      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The context is that they're a student with limited money, they usually make their own food, and when they do order, the total ends up being high because of delivery fees. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but they're in the US now, probably unfamiliar with tipping culture here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how tipping works in the US. In the US, it's customary to tip service workers, including delivery drivers, around 15-20% of the bill. However, some people might tip less if they can't afford it. The person in question is a student with limited funds, so maybe they can't afford the standard tip. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping. \n\nThe user says they paid with a card, which might make tipping less automatic. If they paid with cash, they might give the change as a tip, but with card, maybe it's easier to skip. However, in the US, even when paying by card, people often add a tip, either manually or through the app. So if they didn't add any tip at all, that could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the person is in a financial bind. They're a student who doesn't order food often, so maybe they don't see the need to tip every time, especially when the total is already high. However, in the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe person might not realize that in the US, tipping is part of the service cost, not just a suggestion. So even if they consider their country's 10% as a reference, in the US, delivery tipping can be higher, especially for good service. The cost of the meal plus delivery fee is $19, which might be considered a bit high, but the total is still the total. The question is whether not tipping makes them in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural expectations versus personal financial situation. If the person is unaware of the US tipping norms, maybe they're not at fault. But if they're aware and choosing not to tip despite being able to afford a small amount (even 10% of $19 is about $1.90), then maybe they are. However, the user mentions they're a student with limited money, so maybe even $1.90 is a stretch. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because they're in a different country and might not know the expectations, and they have financial constraints. But some might argue that they should still tip a small amount. But since they're not in their country and the tipping culture is different, maybe they're not at fault for not following it if they're trying to adjust. Alternatively, if they're expected to follow local norms when in the US, they might be in the wrong. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B because they're not maliciously not tipping, just unaware and in a tough financial spot.\n"
