      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, ordering food occasionally. They mention paying $19 for ramen including delivery and no tip. They\u2019re from a country where tipping is 10%, and they tip when paying cash but not with a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually around 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, the total amount here is $19, which might be a bit low for a delivery fee. But the key points are the person's financial situation and their reasoning. Since they're a student with limited funds, maybe they can't afford to tip. Also, they might not be aware that in the US, even when paying by card, a tip is expected. Some might argue that not tipping at all is wrong, but others might understand their situation. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the delivery service allows adding a tip via the app, they could have done that, but maybe they didn't know. Alternatively, they might have thought the delivery fee included a tip, which isn't always the case. The answer might depend on whether they had the means to tip but chose not to, or if they genuinely couldn't. Since they mention they barely have money and rarely order food, perhaps they're not in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to check if there's any obligation regardless of financial situation. However, in the US, tipping is discretionary, so if someone can't afford to tip, it's not their fault. So B makes sense.\n"
