      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery fee to be high. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with card, they don't tip, only when paying cash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically 15-20%, especially when paying by card. The author might not be aware of this, as they mention it's 10% in their country. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are cultural expectations versus personal financial constraints. While the author is in a tight financial situation, the expectation in the US is that tipping is part of the service cost. Not tipping could be seen as not meeting the local norm, hence being in the wrong. On the other hand, if the delivery fee already includes a tip (sometimes it does), then maybe it's less of an issue. But the user says there's a delivery fee and ends up paying a lot, which might not include the tip.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't tip when paying with a card, only cash. But in the US, even with card payments, people are expected to add a tip. So not doing so might be considered rude or inconsiderate. However, the author's financial situation is a mitigating factor. Still, the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy. \n\nIn many cases, people who don't tip by cultural norms might be seen as in the wrong, regardless of their ability to pay. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They didn't follow the local tipping custom, which is part of the service cost expectation here. However, there's a nuance if the delivery fee includes a tip. The user didn't mention that, so assuming it's separate. So final answer A.\n"
