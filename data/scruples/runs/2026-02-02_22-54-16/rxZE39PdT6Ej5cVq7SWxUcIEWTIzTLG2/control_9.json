      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, usually cook their own food, but sometimes order takeout. The place charges a delivery fee, and they end up paying a lot for not much food. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, and when paying cash, they give a tip with change. But when using a card, they don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20%, especially for cashless payments. Since the user is in the US, their country's 10% might not apply here. They might not be aware of the higher expected tip in the US.\n\nThe delivery fee might be separate from the tip. The person is upset about the total cost, including delivery, but maybe they don't realize that the delivery fee is for the service, and the tip is for the delivery person's effort. Since they pay with a card, it's possible that the system allows adding a tip, and not doing so means the delivery person doesn't get any extra. In cash, they give a tip as change, but with card, they skip it. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. In the US, not tipping when using a card could be seen as inconsiderate because the customer can easily add a tip. However, if the person is in a financial struggle, maybe it's understandable. But the expectation is still there. The answer might depend on the US norms versus the user's country's practices. Since the user is in the US, they might be expected to follow local customs. So the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they're not adhering to the local tipping culture even though they can afford to tip given they're ordering food. But some might argue B, considering their financial situation. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy. Since the US norm is higher, and the user is paying with a card (which makes tipping easier), the author is in the wrong for not tipping. So answer A.\n"
