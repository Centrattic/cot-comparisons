Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they order food occasionally, and they're upset about the total cost including delivery and the tip. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying by card, they don't give a tip, and they end up paying $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Tipping customs vary by country. In the US, tipping is customary and expected, often around 15-20%. However, the user is from a different country where 10% is standard, and they might not be aware of US tipping norms. Also, as a student with limited funds, they might be struggling with the higher prices here. They mention paying by card, which might make it harder to add a tip automatically, unlike cash where you can round up the change.\n\nThe question is whether not tipping is wrong. In the US, not tipping can be seen as rude or stingy, especially since delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. However, the user might not know this expectation. Additionally, the cost adds up for them, so it's a financial burden. There's a balance between cultural expectations and personal circumstances. \n\nOn one hand, the delivery driver deserves compensation for their service. On the other, the user is in a different country and might not be aware of local customs. Also, their financial situation could be a mitigating factor. The key here is whether the user's actions are considered wrong given the cultural context and their intent. If they're following their home country's customs without knowing US norms, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they knew or should have known about US tipping practices, they might be. However, the person might genuinely not have known. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because of the cultural difference and financial situation.\n"
