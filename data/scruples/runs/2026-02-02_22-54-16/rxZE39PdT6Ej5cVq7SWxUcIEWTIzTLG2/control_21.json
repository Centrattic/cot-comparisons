      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, don't order food often, and when they do, they pay with a card. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but in the US, they're unsure. They felt it was expensive paying $19 for ramen, which included delivery fees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for delivery services, usually around 10-15%, especially if using a card. However, the user is coming from a different cultural background where tipping might be different. They might not realize that in the US, delivery tips are expected even with card payments, unless it's a cash transaction where the tip is optional based on the change.\n\nThe user is being frugal because they're a student with limited funds. They might not have the extra money to tip, especially if they feel the delivery fee is already high. But from the US perspective, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate since delivery workers rely on tips as part of their income. However, the user might not be aware of this expectation.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're not aware of the US tipping norms. On the other, even if they knew, they might still choose not to tip due to financial constraints. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. If they were aware and still chose not to tip, maybe yes. But if they were unaware, it's less clear. However, the fact that they paid with a card, which often includes a tip option, might be a point. If they didn't include a tip there, they might be expected to. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to check the nuances again.\n"
