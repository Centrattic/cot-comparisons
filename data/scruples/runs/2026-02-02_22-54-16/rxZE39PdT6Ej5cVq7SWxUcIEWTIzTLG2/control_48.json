AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but when paying by card, they don't tip. The total cost here was $19 for ramen noodles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user says in their country it's 10% when paying cash, but maybe in the US, the expectation is different. In the US, tipping delivery is common, often around 15-20%, especially if the order is expensive. But the cost here is $19, which isn't that high. However, the question is whether not tipping at all is wrong.\n\nThe person argues that when paying by card, they don't tip because they don't get change. But in the US, when you pay by card, the tip is usually added at checkout. So maybe the user is not aware of that. If the user didn't include a tip because they weren't sure how to add it via card, that's a different matter. But if they had the option and chose not to, then maybe they are in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The delivery driver's income might rely on tips. So even if the person is on a tight budget, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the cost being high might make them feel it's unfair to add a tip.\n\nIt's a balance between cultural expectations and personal financial constraints. The user's reasoning is that they don't tip when paying by card because they don't have change, but that might not be a valid reason in the US system where digital tipping is standard. So the user might be in the wrong for not leaving any tip, even a small one, especially if they can afford the meal itself.\n"
