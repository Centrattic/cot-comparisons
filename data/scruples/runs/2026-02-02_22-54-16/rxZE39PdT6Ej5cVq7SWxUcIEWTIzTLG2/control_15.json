      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nThe person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays with a card. They mention that the total cost is high, including delivery fees, and they end up paying $19 for ramen. In their country, the usual tip is 10%, but when paying cash, they tip when getting change. However, when using a card, they don't tip.\n\nFirst, I should consider the cultural norms in the US. I know that in the US, tipping is a common practice for service workers, including delivery drivers. The standard tip is typically around 15-20%, but some people might tip less depending on the situation. The author is from a country where 10% is normal, but they're in the US now. So, there's a cultural difference here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not tipping when paying with a card. If tipping isn't automatic and the author doesn't add anything, maybe they are expected to tip even when using a card. Some delivery apps have a tip option at checkout, so if the author didn't add a tip there, maybe that's the issue. However, if the author didn't have the option or didn't know, maybe it's not their fault.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the total is high. Maybe they feel the delivery fee is part of the cost, so they don't see the need to tip extra. But in the US, the delivery fee is often just for the delivery, and the tip is for the service. So the driver might not get the delivery fee, only the tip. If the author didn't tip, the driver might not get paid fairly.\n\nBut the author is a student with limited funds. They might not be able to afford a tip. However, the argument is that in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service. So even if it's a small amount, maybe they should tip something. Alternatively, if the total is already high, maybe they can leave a lower tip but still add something.\n\nAnother angle: when paying cash, they tip when getting change, but with a card, they don't. If using a card, maybe the tip isn't automatically added, so the author has to manually add it. If they didn't do that, they might be in the wrong. But if the app doesn't have a tip option, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because in the US, tipping is expected regardless of payment method. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the driver's income, especially since the author is aware of the practice. However, the author's financial situation is a factor, but it's still a matter of following local norms. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing.\n"
