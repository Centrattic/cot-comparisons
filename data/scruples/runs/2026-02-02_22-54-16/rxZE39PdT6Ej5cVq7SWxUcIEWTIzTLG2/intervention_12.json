Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy when they paid by card. They mention being a student with limited money and that the total ended up being $19 for ramen, which seems high to them. They also note that in their country, tipping is 10%, and they tip when using cash. In the US, tipping for delivery can vary, but it's common to tip around 15-20% or a flat rate like $2-3, especially if it's a low-cost item. \n\nThe key points here are the person's financial situation and cultural differences. As a student, they might be budget-conscious. The total cost seems high to them, which could influence their decision. Also, they tip when paying cash, so maybe they're just not used to how tipping works in the US via card payments. \n\nIn the US, it's expected to tip delivery people, even if paying by card. Some places allow you to add a tip through the app, but if not, it's still customary. However, the person's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the item was overpriced. They might not be in the wrong because they're being honest about their circumstances and trying to manage their expenses. Cultural norms play a role here too\u2014since they're used to 10% tipping, perhaps they're adjusting to different expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to tip at all could be seen as not meeting the local standard. But given the context\u2014student, limited funds, cultural adjustment\u2014it's a gray area. The person isn't necessarily wrong if they're making an effort to tip when possible and the situation is tight. So, the answer is B.\n"
