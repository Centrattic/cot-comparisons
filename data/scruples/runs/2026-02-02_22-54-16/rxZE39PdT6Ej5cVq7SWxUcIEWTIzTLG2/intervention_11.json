AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student with limited money who doesn't often order food. They're wondering if not tipping the delivery guy is wrong. They mention paying 19$ for ramen, which includes a delivery fee, and they pay by card.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, typically around 15-20% for services like delivery. The user is from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're used to a different system. The key points here are their financial situation and the context of where they're from. \n\nTipping in the US is part of the compensation for service workers, especially since minimum wage might be lower for tipped positions. Not tipping could be seen as withholding part of their expected pay. However, the user is a student with limited funds, which might make it hard for them to tip consistently. Still, in the US context, not tipping could be considered rude or unfair to the delivery person. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The user is paying by card, which might make it easier to add a tip. Maybe they didn't know they should tip when paying by card, since in cash they give change. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer hinges on cultural expectations versus personal circumstances. \n\nSome might argue that regardless of the situation, tipping is expected in the US, so the user is in the wrong. Others might empathize with their financial situation and consider it a minor mistake, especially if they're new to the US tipping culture. \n\nI think the user isn't entirely wrong because they're in a different cultural context and have financial constraints. But there's also a case that they should adapt to local norms if they're in the US. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. Since the user is a student and doesn't order often, maybe the expectation isn't as strict as for frequent orders. So leaning towards answer B.\n"
