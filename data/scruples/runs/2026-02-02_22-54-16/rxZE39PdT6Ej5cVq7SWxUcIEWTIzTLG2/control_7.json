      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total including delivery fees too high. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but they paid with a card and didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US versus their home country. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often expected around 15-20%, especially for cash payments. However, when paying by card, sometimes people forget to add a tip, especially if they're not used to it. The user might not realize that in the US, even with card payments, a tip is expected. \n\nThe user's argument is that they're a student with limited funds and the total cost is already high. They might feel that the delivery fee is separate from the tip, and since they paid with a card, they didn't have to give extra. But the key point here is whether tipping is considered part of the service cost. Even with a card, the expectation is that you include a tip, perhaps through the app or at the time of payment. \n\nAlso, the total being $19 for ramen might seem high, but delivery fees and service charges can add up. However, the user's responsibility is to check if the tip was included when paying by card. If they didn't add a tip, even if they paid electronically, they might be in the wrong from the US perspective. \n\nBut there's also the angle of cultural differences. If they're from a country where tipping isn't as expected, they might not realize the norms here. However, the question is about whether they're at fault. The user might not be in the wrong if they were unaware, but in the US context, not tipping is generally considered poor etiquette, especially when the option was available. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user had the opportunity to tip via card and didn't. If they didn't know, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they chose not to despite knowing the US tipping norms, then they are. The scenario says they paid with a card, but it's unclear if they added a tip through the payment method. The user might have assumed that the delivery fee covered the driver's pay, but in reality, tips are separate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't add a tip intentionally, but if they were unaware due to cultural norms and the payment method didn't allow for easy tipping, they might not be. However, since the question is about the US context, the expectation is to tip regardless of payment method, so the answer is likely A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
