      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) too high. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but they pay with a card and don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it's not enforced by law. However, the author is from a country where tipping is 10%, so there might be a cultural difference here. They might not be used to the US norms.\n\nNext, the financial aspect: the author is a student with limited funds. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which includes a delivery fee. The cost might feel high to them, and they might be stretching their budget. But is that a valid reason not to tip? In the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So even if the total is high, the author might still be expected to tip.\n\nHowever, there's the method of payment. The author says they tip when paying cash but not with a card. Maybe they're under the impression that using a card doesn't require tipping, but that's not the case. Many people use apps where they can add a tip digitally. The author might not know how to tip via card, or perhaps they assume the delivery fee covers the tip, which it doesn't.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not being stingy out of malice but due to a lack of knowledge about US tipping customs. They might not realize that even with a card, a tip is expected. In that case, it's a cultural misunderstanding rather than being in the wrong. But if they knew and chose not to tip to save money, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the cultural context and the author's financial situation, maybe they aren't. But in the US, not tipping is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. However, if the author is unaware of the norm, it might mitigate the wrongdoing. But the story doesn't mention whether they knew about US tipping practices. They just followed their home country's standard. So maybe they are not in the wrong because they acted based on their cultural norms. Alternatively, if they should have known better, they might be. But the story doesn't indicate they were aware of the US standard. So B (no) seems plausible.\n"
