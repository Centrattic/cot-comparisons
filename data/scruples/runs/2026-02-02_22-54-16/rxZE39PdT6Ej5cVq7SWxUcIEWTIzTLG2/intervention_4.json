AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a student who's tight on money and orders food occasionally. They mention not tipping the delivery guy because they paid with a card and are concerned about the total cost, which includes a delivery fee. They compare it to their home country's 10% tipping norm, but in the US, tipping practices might be different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even though it's not mandatory. However, it's often expected as part of the service industry's income. But since the user is a student with limited funds, their financial situation is a factor. They might not have the means to tip as much as someone who earns more. \n\nThe key points here are the user's intent and circumstances. They are not avoiding tipping out of spite or ignorance but because they're budgeting carefully. They also paid with a card, which might make leaving cash tips less convenient, but some platforms allow adding a tip electronically. If they didn't know they could tip digitally, that's a different story. But the user doesn't mention that, so maybe they just didn't want to spend the money.\n\nAnother angle is whether the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The user is upset about the total cost, which includes delivery fees. If they see these as separate from the tip, they might feel it's unfair to add another 10% on top. However, in the US, tips are considered part of the total payment for the service, so even with a delivery fee, a tip is expected as a way to compensate the delivery person.\n\nHowever, the user's financial constraints could be seen as a valid reason. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they should order less or choose cheaper options. But the question is about right or wrong. In the US, not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair to the delivery person, who relies on tips as a significant portion of their income. But the user isn't in the US, so their understanding might be based on their home country's norms, which differ.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If we consider the US context, not tipping could be problematic because it affects someone's income. But if we consider their financial situation and cultural background, it's more of a misunderstanding. The answer might depend on whether the user had the means to tip but chose not to, which could be seen as wrong. But since they mention they have limited money, it's a gray area. They might not be in the wrong if they can't afford to tip, but ideally, they should tip a smaller amount if possible. However, the user's situation is tight, so maybe B is the right answer.\n"
