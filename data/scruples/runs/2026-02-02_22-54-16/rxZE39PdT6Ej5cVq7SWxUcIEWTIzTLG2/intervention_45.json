AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a student with limited money, orders food rarely, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping. They're from a country where 10% is standard, but in the US, tipping practices might be different. The key points here are their financial situation, the payment method, and their understanding of tipping norms.\n\nIn the US, tipping for delivery is customary, though not always enforced. Some places include a tip automatically, but others don't. Since the user is paying with a card, maybe they didn't have change to leave a tip, which is common in cash transactions. But in the US, even with card payments, it's expected to add a tip through the app or at the time of payment. The user might not be aware of this difference from their home country.\n\nHowever, the user is in a tough financial spot. They're a student, so their budget is tight. If they can't afford to tip, it's not entirely their fault. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Arguably, not tipping is considered rude in the US, so they might be seen as in the wrong. On the other hand, their financial constraints and lack of awareness about US tipping norms could mitigate that.\n\nThe delivery fee is separate from the tip, so maybe the user is conflating the two. The total cost being high doesn't absolve them from tipping, but their situation is understandable. Tipping is a cultural expectation in the US, so not doing it could be seen as neglecting a social norm. However, if they can't afford it, it's a different story. The answer hinges on whether financial hardship excuses not tipping in this context.\n\nI think the answer is B (they're not in the wrong) because they're a student with limited funds, and the situation is understandable. But some might argue that they should still tip if they can, even a small amount. Since they mentioned they usually make their own food and only order occasionally, maybe they aren't used to the tipping system here. So, while it's not ideal, they're not entirely at fault.\n"
