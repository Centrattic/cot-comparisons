      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the writer is a student with limited money. They rarely order food but sometimes do, and they find the total cost (including delivery fee) high for not much food. They paid with a card and didn't tip. In their country, tipping is 10%, but they don't know the US norms. They paid $19 for ramen, which they think is expensive.\n\nIn the US, tipping for delivery can vary. Some places might expect a tip, even if it's not mandatory. However, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. The writer didn't tip because they paid with a card. But in the US, even with card payments, it's common to add a tip at checkout or through the app. If the app allows adding a tip, not doing so could be seen as not contributing to the driver's income.\n\nHowever, the writer is in a difficult financial situation. They mention being a student and not having much money. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they should skip ordering food when possible. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that tips are part of the service, and not tipping is being inconsiderate. Others might understand the financial struggle and not hold it against them. It's a balance between the driver's income and the customer's ability to pay.\n\nSo, depending on the cultural norms and the specific situation (like whether the app allowed tipping or if the driver expected it), the answer could go either way. But in the US, even small tips are appreciated, so not tipping might be considered wrong, especially if it's easy to do. But considering the writer's financial situation, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong.\n"
