AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost, including delivery and no tip, to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but they pay with a card and don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, but it's not legally required. However, the situation here is different because the author is paying with a card. When using cash, people often round up the total as a tip. With a card, it might be less automatic. The author might not be aware that in the US, even with card payments, a tip is expected for delivery. \n\nThe author is a student with limited funds, so their perspective is about financial constraints. They might not realize that delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Some might argue that not tipping at all is inconsiderate, but others might say that in a cashless transaction, it's less expected, especially if the author isn't aware of the local norms. \n\nAlso, the total cost being high is a factor. If the delivery fee is already high, the author might feel the service is overpriced, leading them to not tip. But the tip is separate from the delivery fee. \n\nIn the US, some restaurants add a gratuity for large parties or delivery, but if it's not added, customers are supposed to tip. The author's justification is that they don't have much money and in their country, they tip when paying cash. Since they're in the US now, maybe they're adjusting to different norms. \n\nSo, considering all that, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they should have tipped despite the payment method. Since in the US, even with a card, a tip is expected for delivery, the author might be in the wrong. But if they're not aware of that, maybe not. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether there's a misunderstanding. The key point is that in the US, not tipping at all is generally seen as wrong, regardless of payment method. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they should tip, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to financial constraints and lack of awareness. But the standard here is that tipping is expected, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
