      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high for a small meal. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when paying cash, they tip with the change. But when using a card, they didn't tip, and now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, even though it's not mandatory. Unlike some countries where service charges are included, in the US, tips are separate and expected. The author comes from a country where tipping is 10%, which might be different from the US standard. However, when they use a card, they didn't leave a tip, which might be the issue here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't afford to tip because of the high delivery fee and the total cost. But in the US, delivery drivers rely heavily on tips as part of their income. Not tipping, especially when using a card, might be seen as not contributing to their earnings. The fact that they didn't tip when using a card is significant because cash transactions often make tipping more spontaneous, whereas card payments might require an intentional decision to add a tip.\n\nSo, from the US perspective, the author is not following the expected norm. Even if they're a student and money is tight, the expectation is still there. The total cost being high doesn't negate the need to tip. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adhering to the local custom, which affects the delivery person's income. However, some might argue that they're just being honest about their financial situation, but in the US context, not tipping is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason.\n\nI think the correct answer here is A, meaning the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the established US tipping practice for delivery services.\n"
