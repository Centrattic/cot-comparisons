AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which they're wondering if they should have.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. The user says in their country, it's 10%, but they're in the US now. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually around 15-20%, sometimes even more. So if they paid with a card, they might have the option to add a tip, but if they didn't, that's a problem here. However, the user might not be aware of US tipping norms.\n\nThe user is a student with financial constraints. They feel the delivery fee is high already, leading to a total of $19 for ramen. The question is whether not tipping is wrong. \n\nArguments for being in the wrong (A): In the US, delivery tipping is expected. Not tipping could be seen as disrespectful or unfair, as delivery workers often rely on tips. Even if paying with a card, the option to add a tip is there, so not doing so is against norms. \n\nArguments for not being in the wrong (B): The user is in a different country (US) and might not be aware of local customs. They have financial constraints. The delivery fee is seen as high, so they might not perceive the need for an additional tip. They might not understand that tips are part of the service cost in the US.\n\nBut the user did mention that in their country, it's 10%, so they're aware of tipping, just maybe not the higher US standard. Also, paying with a card doesn't excuse not tipping. The expectation is still there regardless of payment method. Even if the total seems high, the tip is separate from the delivery fee.\n\nSo I lean towards A because the user is in the US and should follow local norms. Not tipping could be seen as wrong here. However, the user's financial situation might be a mitigating factor, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy. So the answer is likely A.\n"
