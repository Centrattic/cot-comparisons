When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The user is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost high, including a delivery fee. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip when they get change. However, they used a card this time and didn't tip, leading to a $19 total for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary, especially for service workers like delivery drivers. The standard tip is around 15-20%, but it can vary. If the user is in the US and pays with a card, some places might automatically add a tip, but if not, it's expected to add one manually. Since the user is used to tipping only with cash, maybe they're not aware of the US practice where even card payments require a tip. \n\nThe user argues that the total is high, but the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The delivery fee is a charge by the restaurant or delivery service, while the tip is for the driver's service. Even if the total seems expensive, the tip is a separate consideration. Not tipping could be seen as unfair to the delivery person, especially since their income might rely on tips.\n\nHowever, the user's financial situation is tight. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they should adjust their ordering habits. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. In the US context, not tipping could be considered rude or inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance. For example, if they didn't know the expectation, but since they mentioned paying with cash and tipping when getting change, maybe they knew but just didn't in this case. So, the consensus might be that they are at fault.\n"
