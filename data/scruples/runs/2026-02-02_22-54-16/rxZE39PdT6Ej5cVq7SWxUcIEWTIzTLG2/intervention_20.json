AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The context is that the author is a student with limited funds, orders food occasionally, and feels the total cost (including delivery) is too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they tip during the change. However, when using a card, they might not tip because it's a different process.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for service jobs, including delivery. Typically, 15-20% is common, but delivery tipping can vary. Some people might leave around $3-5 regardless of the order size. Since the author is in a different country, their expectations might differ, but they're now in the US context here.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. They pay 19$ for ramen, which includes delivery. They might be struggling to afford even the base cost. The question is whether not tipping is wrong in this situation. The key points here are financial constraints and cultural expectations. \n\nIf the author is paying with a card, maybe they don't have the habit of adding a tip during the card transaction, unlike with cash where it's more immediate. However, in the US, even with card payments, people usually add a tip. The author might not be aware of this, especially if they're from a different country where tipping is different.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings, especially if the author is used to different practices. On the other hand, the author's financial situation is tight, and the total cost seems high. There's a balance between cultural norms and personal circumstances. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, in the US context, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate because the delivery person depends on it. However, if the author is genuinely unable to afford even a small tip, maybe there's understanding. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the user's own country's practices are different, but they're in a situation where US norms apply, the expectation would be to tip. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong for not tipping, even if it's due to financial constraints.\n"
