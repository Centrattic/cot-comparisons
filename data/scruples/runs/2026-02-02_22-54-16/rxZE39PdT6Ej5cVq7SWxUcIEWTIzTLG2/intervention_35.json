      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They usually make their own food but sometimes order. The place they order from has a high delivery fee, making the total cost around $19 for ramen. They mention in their country, tipping is 10%, but in the US, they might not know the norms. They paid by card, which might make tipping optional or automatic? \n\nIn the US, tipping for delivery varies. Some places add a tip to the total, especially for card payments. If the author didn't tip, maybe the delivery person didn't get a cut. But the author's reasoning is that they can't afford it and the prices are already high. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural expectations. In the US, while tipping isn't mandatory, it's customary, especially for delivery where the delivery fee might not include a tip. However, the author is a student with financial constraints. Since they paid by card, maybe they didn't have the option to tip or weren't aware. The high cost might also be a factor. So, while it's common to tip, the author's situation shows financial hardship, so they might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
