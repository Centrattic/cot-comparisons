      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and in their country, they tip 10% when paying cash. But in the US, they might not be familiar with the tipping norms. They paid with a card and didn't tip, and now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping customs. In the US, it's customary to tip service workers, including delivery drivers, typically around 15-20%. However, tips are not mandatory and are considered a service charge. The author is coming from a different cultural background where tipping is different, which might affect their understanding. \n\nThe author mentions paying 19$ for ramen, which includes delivery fees. They might feel that the total is already high, so adding a tip on top seems like a lot. But in the US, tips are separate from the cost of the item and delivery fees. The delivery fee usually covers the driver's base pay, and the tip is supposed to supplement their income. \n\nHowever, the author didn't have cash to tip and used a card. Some people might argue that when paying with a card, you can still add a tip, so not doing so is inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author might not have known the local custom or felt it was too expensive. \n\nBut the key points here: the author is a student with limited funds, possibly unfamiliar with US tipping norms, and didn't tip because they paid with a card. In the US, even when paying with a card, it's expected to add a tip. So, not tipping in this context might be seen as not following the local custom, hence the author could be in the wrong. However, considering their financial situation and cultural background, some might be more understanding. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the expectation of tipping applies regardless of payment method. Since in the US, tips are expected even with card payments, not tipping could be considered wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes), but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, if the author is a foreigner unfamiliar with the system, maybe B (No). But the question is about the US context, so the expectation is there. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
