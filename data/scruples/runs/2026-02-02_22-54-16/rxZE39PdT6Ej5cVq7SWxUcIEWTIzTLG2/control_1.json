      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student, doesn't have much money, and usually makes their own food. When they do order takeout, they end up paying a lot for not much food, especially when there's a delivery fee. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when they pay cash, they tip with the change. However, when using a card, they didn't tip. The main issue is whether they're at fault for not tipping in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user mentions their country's 10% tipping standard, but the question is about the US. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, though it's not as standardized as restaurant tipping. Typically, people might tip around 15-20% for delivery, but some might leave less if the service is poor or the order is small. However, the author is a student with limited funds, paying $19 for ramen. They might feel that the price is already high, making tipping difficult.\n\nNext, the payment method matters. When paying with cash, it's easier to give a tip on the spot, but with a card, the author didn't add a tip. In the US, some delivery platforms allow adding a tip during payment, so maybe the author didn't do that. If the author didn't add a tip at all when using a card, that could be an issue because the delivery person might not receive expected compensation. However, if the author intended to tip but forgot or didn't know how, that's different.\n\nAlso, the cost of the meal is $19. If that's considered expensive for the portion size, the author might feel it's unreasonable to add a tip. However, delivery fees are separate from the meal price, and the delivery person's wage might be low, relying on tips as part of their income. In the US, delivery drivers, especially for places like DoorDash or Uber Eats, often have base pay plus tips. If the author is ordering through such services, not tipping could impact the driver's earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's financial situation is a factor. As a student, they might be budgeting strictly and view the delivery fee as excessive. They might not be aware of the tipping norms in the US or might not consider that the delivery person's pay depends on tips. There's also the argument that the total cost, including the delivery fee, is already high, making it a tough choice for someone with limited funds.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? In the US, while there's no legal requirement to tip, it's a cultural expectation. Failing to tip, especially when it's easy to do so (like adding a tip during online payment), could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's financial constraints and lack of awareness about US tipping norms might mitigate the blame. The key is whether the author had the means to tip and chose not to. If they could afford the meal and delivery but not the tip, maybe they should reconsider. But if the total cost is already straining their budget, it's more understandable.\n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on perspective. If the author didn't tip because they couldn't afford it, some might argue it's not their fault. However, if they could have added a small tip despite the cost, then they might be in the wrong. The scenario doesn't specify if the author left any tip or none. If they left none, then in the US context, it's more likely they are in the wrong. If they left a small tip, maybe not. But based on the description, they didn't tip at all when using a card. Therefore, considering US norms, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's a case for B (not in the wrong) due to financial constraints. However, the consensus in the US is that tipping is expected regardless of the price, so A is more likely the correct answer.\n"
