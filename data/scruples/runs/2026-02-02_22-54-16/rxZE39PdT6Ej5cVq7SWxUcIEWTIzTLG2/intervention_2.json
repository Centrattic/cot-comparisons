      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of a situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery person. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money, usually makes their own food. They order occasionally, and when they do, the total including delivery fees is high. They paid with a card and didn't tip. In their country, it's 10%, but they tip when paying cash. They're wondering if they did wrong by not tipping here in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Typically, 15-20% is common, but it can vary. The author didn't tip when using a card, which might be different from their home country. However, the user is in the US now, so local customs apply.\n\nBut the author's financial situation is tight. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which includes delivery fees. The question is whether not tipping is wrong given their circumstances. Some might argue that tipping is expected regardless of income, while others might be more understanding.\n\nAlso, when paying with a card, sometimes the system automatically adds a tip, but the author might not be aware of that. If they were paying cash, they'd tip, but with a card, maybe they didn't. However, in the US, even with card payments, it's expected to add a tip. The app might have a tip section, and the author didn't use it.\n\nBut the author is a student with limited funds. Maybe they didn't know it's expected. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. Since the US expects tipping, not doing so could be seen as wrong. However, if they're new to the US or unaware of the difference, that's a factor. But the user in the scenario is asking for an opinion. The user themselves think the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering that the author is in the US, where tipping is standard, and the delivery fee is part of the cost, but the author didn't tip. Even though they have financial constraints, the expectation in the US is to tip. So maybe A is the answer. But some might argue that the author's situation is understandable. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the norm is to tip, then not doing so could be seen as wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
