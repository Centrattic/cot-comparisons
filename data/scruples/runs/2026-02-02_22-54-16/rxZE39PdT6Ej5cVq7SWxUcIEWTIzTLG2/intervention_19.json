      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. Let me break this down. The author is a student with limited money, usually makes their own food. When they do order, they end up paying a lot for not much, including a delivery fee. They paid with a card and didn't tip, questioning if they're at fault. In their country, tipping is 10%, but they might not be familiar with U.S. tipping norms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider U.S. tipping customs. Typically, in the U.S., a 15-20% tip is standard for delivery services, especially if the delivery is done in person. However, some people do tip 10% if they're short on funds or not used to it. The cost here is $19 for ramen, which sounds high. Delivery fees can add up, so maybe the total includes base price, delivery fee, and tip. But the author is paying with a card and not giving any tip. \n\nIn the U.S., when paying with a card, tips are usually added at the time of payment, either automatically or manually. If the author didn't include a tip, that's a different approach than in their home country. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The key factors here are intent and awareness of local norms. If the author is a student from another country, they might not be aware that tipping is expected in the U.S. Even if they knew the 10% rate from their country, maybe they thought that's the same here. But in the U.S., delivery tips are often expected on top of the delivery fee, so maybe $3-5 is standard. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're paying a lot already, and in their country, they tip when using cash. Since they paid with a card, perhaps they didn't have the opportunity to leave a tip, or they didn't know the custom. However, in the U.S., even with card payments, you're supposed to add a tip. So if they didn't do that, they might be seen as not following the local norm. \n\nBut the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. That could be because the total amount seems high, or maybe the author is not aware of the tipping culture. On the other hand, others might argue that it's the customer's choice, and not tipping is just their preference. However, in the U.S., not tipping at all might be considered rude, especially if the service is good. \n\nWait, the delivery guy's job often relies on tips. So if the author is in the U.S., not tipping could impact the delivery person's income. But the author is a student with limited funds. It's a balance between following local customs and personal financial constraints. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They might be misunderstanding the tipping expectations, but it's a cultural difference. Plus, they're a student with limited means, so expecting them to tip 15-20% on an $18 order (assuming $19 total) would be about $3-4 more. However, if they left zero, that's different. Maybe they left a small tip? The post is a bit unclear. But the key is that they're not aware of U.S. tipping norms. So, they're not at fault for not knowing, but maybe could educate themselves. But since they asked if they're in the wrong, and the answer is B, it's more about not being in the wrong. However, some might argue that they are in the wrong because they should have known. Hmm.\n"
