      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they rarely order food, and when they do, they feel like they're paying a lot for not much. The delivery fee makes the total around $19 for ramen noodles. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, and they tip when using cash by giving the change as a tip. But with card payments, they don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. The user is from a country where tipping is 10%, but they're in the US where tipping is typically 15-20% for services like delivery. So there's a cultural difference here. The person might not be aware that in the US, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income since they might not get a tip-based wage otherwise.\n\nThe key points here are: the person is a student with limited funds, the total cost including delivery is high, and they don't tip when using a card. In the US, even with a card, tips can be added via the payment method. If they don't tip, they're not contributing to the driver's income, which is expected here. However, the person might not realize that tips are part of the driver's pay, especially if they're from a different country.\n\nOn the other hand, the person is in a financial situation where they can't afford to tip, and they're trying to manage their expenses. The question is whether not tipping, especially with a card, is wrong. In the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, but if they're unaware of the cultural norm, that might affect the judgment. Also, if the delivery fee is already high, maybe the person feels the cost is unreasonable, but that's separate from the tip.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the person is expected to tip regardless of their financial situation. If the norm is strong, like in the US, then not tipping might be considered wrong, hence A. But if there's a valid reason (like financial hardship), maybe B. However, the person could have still tipped a small amount even with a card. The fact that they don't tip when using a card suggests they're choosing not to, which in the US context could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
