When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, and they find the total cost (including delivery and no tip) to be high for the food they get. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they paid by card and didn't tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even if you pay by card. Many people would expect a tip, maybe 10-15%, because delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. The person here didn't tip, but they're from a country where cash and 10% are standard. However, the US is different, and not tipping by card might be seen as not following local customs.\n\nBut the user is a student with limited funds, so their financial situation is tight. They might not be aware that in the US, even with card payments, tipping is expected. Also, the total cost being high (like $19 for ramen) could make them feel it's unreasonable to tip extra. However, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The fee covers the service cost, while the tip is for the driver's work. \n\nThe key points are: Are they aware of US tipping norms? Do they have the means to tip? The user says they don't have much money, but they chose to order food, which implies they can afford it. However, if they're not used to the US system, they might not know. On one hand, the driver deserves fair compensation. On the other, the user's financial constraints are a factor. \n\nI think the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because in the US context, not tipping when you have the means, even if you're a student, is against the norm. But if they genuinely can't afford it, maybe B (not in the wrong). However, since they ordered food, they can afford to tip a small amount. The main issue is the expectation in the US versus their home country. So, the answer might be A because they didn't tip despite being able to, even if it's a different custom elsewhere.\n"
