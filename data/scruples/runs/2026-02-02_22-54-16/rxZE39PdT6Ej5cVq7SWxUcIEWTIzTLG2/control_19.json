AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery and tip too high. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but they usually tip when paying cash. Here, they paid with a card and didn't tip, costing $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in the US, maybe? Because they mention US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery, often around 15-20%. However, the person is coming from a country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware of the US expectations.\n\nThe key points are: they can't afford to tip because they're a student with limited money, they think the total is too high, and they paid with a card, which might make leaving cash tips harder. But in the US, tips are part of the expected payment when using a card as well, often added at checkout. So even if they paid with a card, they should include a tip in the total.\n\nThe question is whether not tipping is wrong. Arguments for yes: Not tipping in the US is considered rude, and delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. The user's financial situation might be tough, but they chose to order food, which typically includes a tip. Arguments against: They're a student with limited funds, maybe they didn't realize the expectation, and the total seems high for the meal. However, in the US, the tip is part of the service, so not including it could be seen as a mistake.\n\nI think the answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because in the US context, not tipping is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of payment method. Even if they think it's different in their country, once they're in the US, following local norms is expected. The high total might be a result of the delivery fee plus the expected tip, which is part of the service. So not tipping would leave the driver without that compensation, which is part of their income.\n"
