AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a student with limited money and orders food occasionally. They pay with a card and didn't tip because in their country, it's 10% and they tip when paying cash. They spent $19 on ramen with delivery fees.\n\nHmm, in the US, tipping for delivery is common but maybe not as strict as in-person service. Some people tip delivery drivers, others don't, especially if they're paying by card. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping. \n\nIn the US, delivery tipping isn't always expected the same way as restaurant tipping. Some people might argue that delivery drivers rely on tips because their pay is low. But others might say it's a service fee or part of the delivery cost. Since the person is using a card, maybe they find it harder to tip because they don't get change. \n\nThe person mentions their financial situation. If they can't afford to tip, maybe it's understandable. But if they can afford to order the food, they might be expected to tip. However, since they're a student with limited funds, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. Some might say they're in the wrong for not tipping, others might empathize with their situation. But in the US, even with card payments, many apps have a built-in tip option. If they didn't use that, maybe they should have. But if they didn't know, then maybe not. \n\nThe key points: They didn't tip despite being able to pay by card. In the US, even with cards, tipping is expected for delivery sometimes. So maybe they are in the wrong. But considering their financial situation, maybe they're not. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they might not be aware of the US tipping culture for delivery and have financial constraints. But some might argue A. Hmm.\n"
