      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying by card, they don't tip because they usually do it with cash when there's change. The main question is whether they're at fault for not tipping in the US context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20%, especially for cash transactions. However, when paying by card, it's common to tip through the app or at the time of payment. If the app allows tipping, not doing so might be expected, but if the app doesn't have that option, maybe it's different. The user says they paid with their card, but maybe they didn't add a tip through the payment method. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they are a student with limited funds and the total cost is high. They might feel that the delivery fees and the food cost already add up a lot, so tipping is an extra expense they can't afford. The key here is whether the platform allows for tipping via card, and if the user had the opportunity but chose not to. \n\nIf they paid by card and the app required or gave the option to tip, then not tipping might be considered inconsiderate because the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income. However, if the app didn't have a tipping option at the time of payment, then maybe the user isn't at fault. The situation isn't clear on that detail. \n\nAlso, the user mentions their country's practice is 10%, but in the US, higher tips are expected. However, if the user isn't aware of this cultural difference, maybe it's less about being wrong and more about a lack of knowledge. But in the US context, not tipping could be seen as neglecting a customary expectation, especially if the delivery person is expecting it. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a financial position where they're struggling, and the total cost is a burden. The question is whether the expectation of tipping overrides their financial constraints. If the user is unable to tip due to financial hardship, that's a valid reason. But if they're choosing not to tip despite the ability to do so, that's different. \n\nThe user's scenario doesn't specify if they had the means to tip. They say they \"don't have a lot of money,\" but it's unclear if they have zero discretionary funds or just limited. If they're making a conscious choice not to tip even when they can afford a small amount, that's one thing. If they can't afford to tip at all, that's another. \n\nIn the US, delivery drivers often depend on tips because their base pay might be low. So not tipping could affect their income. However, the user's perspective is that the fees are too high, making the total unreasonable. There's a balance between expectations and personal circumstances. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user had the ability to tip and chose not to, versus being unable to due to financial constraints. Since the user mentions they \"barely order food\" and \"don't have a lot of money,\" it's possible they're in a tight spot. However, in the US, tipping is expected regardless of the payment method. If they paid by card and didn't add a tip, even a small one, they might be in the wrong. But if they had no way to tip via card (like the app didn't allow it), then it's not their fault. The scenario doesn't specify that detail, so it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven the information, I think the user is in the wrong because they had the means to tip (paying by card) but didn't, even though they might be struggling financially. The expectation in the US is to tip delivery, so not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they couldn't tip via card, that's different. Since the question doesn't clarify that, but the user says they paid with a card, maybe they had the option. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I'm not entirely certain because there's a financial hardship angle.\n"
