      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total price including delivery fees high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they usually tip when paying cash by giving change. Now, they're using a card and didn't tip, hence the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The standard tip is often 15-20%, but even 10% might be acceptable depending on the situation. The author is from a country where 10% is normal, which might be different from US expectations.\n\nThe author is paying with a card, which makes it easier to include a tip. However, they didn't do it this time. They argue that the total cost is already high with delivery fees, but the delivery fee is separate from the tip. Tips are meant as a reward for service, not part of the delivery fee.\n\nThe author's main points are financial constraints and possibly not being aware of US tipping practices. However, since they mentioned using their card, which allows for adding a tip, not leaving one could be seen as neglecting a standard practice. Even if they are used to tipping via cash, the method shouldn't matter; the expectation remains.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not have extra money to tip, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. In the US context, not tipping when you can afford it, even if it's a small amount, might be considered inconsiderate. However, if they can't afford any tip, that's different. The situation states they paid with a card, which implies they had the means to pay the total, so perhaps they could have allocated a small tip.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the financial ability to tip. If they're a student with limited funds but managed to pay for the meal with a card, maybe they could still spare a minimal tip. Alternatively, if the total was too high, maybe they felt it was unreasonable. But the delivery fee is separate from the tip, so the high cost doesn't necessarily excuse not tipping.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's situation is understandable, in the US context, not tipping when using a card (where it's an option) is generally seen as not meeting the expected practice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. However, if they couldn't afford any tip, that's a different case. The description doesn't specify if they couldn't afford it, just that they don't have a lot of money. So the answer might lean towards AITA yes, meaning answer A.\n"
