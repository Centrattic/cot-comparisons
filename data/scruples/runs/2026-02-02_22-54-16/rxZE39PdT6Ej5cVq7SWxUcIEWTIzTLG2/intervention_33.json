AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, order food infrequently, and find the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with card, they don't tip. They paid $19 for ramen, which they find expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common but not as strict as in, say, restaurants where service is part of the job. Some people tip for delivery, some don't. The user comes from a country where 10% is standard, but in the US, tips can vary. Maybe they're confused because in their country, cash tips are common, and when paying by card, maybe there's an option to add a tip. If they paid by card and didn't add a tip, that's their choice.\n\nThe user's justification is financial\u2014they don't have much money. Students often have tight budgets. They also mention the total cost being high, which might make them reluctant to add a tip. But is it wrong not to tip? In the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income, especially since their base pay might be low. However, the expectation isn't as strong as for in-person service. Some people might argue that not tipping is inconsiderate, but others might say it's the customer's choice.\n\nThe key here is whether there's an expectation. If the user is aware that in the US tips are part of the service cost, then not tipping could be seen as not contributing. But if the user isn't aware or isn't in a position to tip, is that their fault? The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies moral or social responsibility. If the user is following their own country's norms (10% when paying cash) but in the US, when using a card, they don't add the tip, maybe they're not aware that tips can be added via card. Alternatively, maybe they're under the impression that the delivery fee includes a tip, but that's not usually the case.\n\nAlso, $19 for ramen might be high, but that's part of the restaurant's pricing. The user's frustration is understandable, but the main issue is whether they should tip. If the user is not tipping despite being able to, even a small amount, some might say they're wrong. However, if they can't afford it, others might be more understanding. The answer hinges on balancing the expectation of tipping with the user's financial situation. Since the user is a student with limited funds, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if tipping is expected and they can afford it (even a small amount), then maybe they are. The answer could be B, but I need to check the nuances.\n"
