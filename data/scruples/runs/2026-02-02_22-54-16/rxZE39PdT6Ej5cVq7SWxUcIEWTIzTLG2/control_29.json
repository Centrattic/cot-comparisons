      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is a student with limited money, usually makes their own food, and only orders occasionally. They mention that the total for the ramen was $19 with a delivery fee, and they paid by card. They say in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying cash, they tip when they get change. They're wondering if they're at fault for not tipping when using a card.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary for delivery services. Even though delivery might not be in-person like a restaurant, the expectation is still there. The delivery fee is separate from the tip. Typically, people tip around 15-20% of the order total, but even 10% would be acceptable in some cases. Since they paid $19, a 10% tip would be about $1.90, which is not a huge amount. The person is a student, so they might be tight on budget, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are understanding the cultural norm. In the US, tips are part of the service workers' pay, even for delivery. Not tipping at all, even with a small order, can be seen as inconsiderate because the delivery person relies on those tips for income. The fact that they pay by card might make it easier to tip, but they chose not to. The argument is that even if it's a small amount, the gesture matters. So, the author might be in the wrong for not contributing anything, especially when the total isn't that high. However, some might argue that if the service was poor, it's acceptable not to tip. The scenario doesn't mention any issues with the delivery, so it's likely expected to tip. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
