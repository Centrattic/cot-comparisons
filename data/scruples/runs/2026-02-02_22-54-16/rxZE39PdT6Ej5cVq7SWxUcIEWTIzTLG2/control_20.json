      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy in the US. The author is a student, doesn't have much money, usually cooks their own food, and only orders delivery sometimes. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but when using a card, they don't tip. They paid $19 for ramen with a delivery fee and feel it's too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms for delivery. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, typically around 10-15%, especially when paying with a card. Since the author is using a card, they might not have the same habit of tipping as when paying cash. However, in the US, not tipping could be seen as rude or stingy, even if the total is high. The user's reasoning is that they can't afford it, being a student. But in the US, tips are part of the service industry workers' income. So, even if the total seems high, the expectation is that a tip is included. However, the author might not be aware of the local customs. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they're in the US, they should follow local expectations. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). However, if they are in a different country where card tipping isn't expected, but the question seems to be about the US. The user mentions the US in the question. So the answer would be A because in the US, not tipping when paying by card is considered wrong, even if they are a student. But maybe there's a cultural difference here. The user's country expects 10% cash tips, but in the US, it's higher and expected regardless of payment method. So the author is in the wrong for not tipping in the US context. Therefore, answer A."
