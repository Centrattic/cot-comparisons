AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. They're a student with limited money, paying around $19 for ramen with a delivery fee. They mention in their country the tip is 10%, but in the US it's different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. Typically, in the US, a 15-20% tip is expected for services like delivery. However, the user is comparing to their home country's 10%, which might be different. Also, they're using a card, so maybe the tip isn't automatic as it would be with cash. \n\nBut the cost is a factor here. $19 for ramen seems high, especially with delivery fees. Students on a budget might feel the price is already steep, making tipping a financial burden. However, the delivery person's income often relies on tips. So there's a balance between personal financial constraints and the service worker's livelihood.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The user didn't tip, but maybe they have a valid reason due to cost. However, the expectation in the US is different. But maybe there's no right or wrong, just a cultural difference or a situation where the person is struggling financially. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the norm is to tip and they didn't, maybe they are. But considering their financial situation, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the user is expected to follow US tipping norms despite their budget.\n"
