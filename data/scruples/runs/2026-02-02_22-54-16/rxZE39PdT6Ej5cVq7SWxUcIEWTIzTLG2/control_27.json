      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost including delivery high. They mention that in their country, they tip 10% when paying cash, but here they pay with a card and don't tip. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20%, though some people might tip less, especially if the service was poor. However, the author is paying with a card, which might make it easier to forget to tip, but the expectation is still there.\n\nThe author is a student with limited funds, which is a possible reason for not tipping. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If tipping is part of the service cost in the US, then not tipping might be considered inconsiderate, even if the person can't afford much. However, if the author is struggling financially, some might argue that it's understandable, especially if they tip when they can (with cash). However, the author mentions they don't tip when paying by card, which is a common method now. \n\nAlso, the total cost being high might affect their decision. If the delivery fee is already high, they might feel the tip is an extra burden. But in the US, tips are separate from the service fee. So even if the delivery fee is included, the tip is still expected. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is aware of the tipping culture. They mention their country's practice, so maybe they're adjusting. But they're now in the US, so adapting to local norms is part of being a guest. Not tipping could be seen as not respecting local customs, which might make them the 'A' in the AITA scenario. However, if they're in a tight financial situation and can't afford to tip, some might sympathize, making them not the 'A'.\n\nBut generally, in the US, not tipping at all for delivery is frowned upon. If the author can afford to pay with a card but not tip, they might be in the wrong. However, if the total is already a strain (like $19 for ramen), maybe it's a valid hardship. It's a bit of a balance between cultural expectations and personal circumstances. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer hinges on the cultural norm being more important than their personal situation. So probably AITA is yes, they are in the wrong. But I need to check if there are exceptions or if their reasoning is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because they have a valid reason (limited funds), but in the US, the expectation is stronger. Different people might have different opinions. In some cases, people don't tip if they can't afford it, but others might still consider that wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards AITA being yes because they're not tipping despite the ability to pay, even if it's a small amount. If they can't afford to tip, they should maybe not order, but since they did, not tipping is inconsiderate.\n"
