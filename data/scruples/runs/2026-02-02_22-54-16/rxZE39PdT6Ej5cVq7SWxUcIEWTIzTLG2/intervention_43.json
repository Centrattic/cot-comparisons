AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost, including delivery and the meal, to be high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, and when paying cash, they tip with the change. However, when using a card, they don't tip. They paid $19 for ramen noodles and are questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user mentioned their country uses a 10% tip, but they're in the US, where tipping is often expected as part of service, sometimes even considered part of the worker's wage. However, the US also has a tipping culture where not tipping can be seen as rude, especially if it's customary. The user is a student with financial constraints, which might affect their ability to tip. \n\nBut the key points here are: 1) They pay with a card, so maybe they find it easier to not tip when using a card since there's no cash to round up. 2) They perceive the total cost as high, which adds to their hesitation to tip. \n\nIs not tipping in the US when using a card acceptable? Well, some people might not tip if they're paying electronically, but generally, the expectation is that you should still tip, regardless of payment method. However, the author's financial situation is a mitigating factor. Students often have limited budgets, and if they're already paying a high price for a small meal, they might prioritize other expenses. \n\nAdditionally, the author isn't being malicious; they're just making a choice based on their circumstances. They also mentioned they do tip when paying with cash, which shows they're conscious of the norm but maybe the card payment method makes it harder to follow. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery driver relies on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could impact their earnings. However, the author's situation is understandable. It's a balance between financial constraints and social expectations. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They are making a choice based on their financial situation and the context of their payment method. While the US expects tipping, it's not a legal requirement, and people can have valid reasons for not doing so, especially when they can't afford it. So the answer is B.\n"
