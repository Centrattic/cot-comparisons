      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and feels the total cost is high with delivery fees. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but they don't tip when paying by card, and they paid $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is a significant part of service workers' income, typically around 15-20% for good service. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard. So maybe they're not used to the US tipping norms. But the question is whether they're in the wrong here.\n\nThe author is paying with a card, not cash. In the US, if you pay by card, it's common to add a tip through the payment method, sometimes with an option on the app or at the time of payment. If they didn't include a tip, maybe that's considered inconsiderate, especially given the delivery fee. But the author argues that the total cost is high, so they can't afford to tip. However, in the US, the delivery fee is separate from the tip, and the tip is expected as a separate charge.\n\nBut the author might not know this. They might be following their country's norms. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the user is in the US, then not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they're in another country, maybe not. Wait, the original question mentions the US, so the context is the US. The user is asking about AITA (Am I the Asshole) in the US context.\n\nSo, in the US, not tipping for delivery is generally frowned upon because delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. Even if the total is high, the expectation is still to tip. The author might be in the wrong because they're not contributing to the delivery person's income, even if they're trying to save money. However, the author's reasoning is that they can't afford to tip, which is a valid point. But the US norm is that tipping is expected regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the service was poor, not tipping is acceptable, but the author doesn't mention that. So if the service was standard, the expectation is to tip. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A), but others might argue they're not (B). However, given the US tipping culture, the answer is more likely A. But I need to check if the question is from the US or another country. The user mentions \"in the US\" when talking about tipping, so the context is the US. So the answer would be A. But wait, the user is in their own country where 10% is standard, but the question is about the US situation. Wait, the original post is from a person in their country, but the AITA subreddit usually discusses US situations. Maybe the user is in the US but used to another country's norms. So they're not following US norms. Therefore, they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
