      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee and tip) too high. They paid with a card and didn't tip, and they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US regarding tipping. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically 10-20%, and is part of the delivery person's income. However, the person is from a country where 10% is standard and tips with cash when using that method. They might not be aware that in the US, not tipping when paying by card is common and acceptable. Some people argue that tips are part of the service cost, so if the total includes a tip, it's covered. But if it's separate, maybe not tipping is seen as wrong. However, the person is in a financial situation where they're saving money by cooking and only order occasionally. They mention the total being $19 for ramen, which they find high. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? On one hand, US tipping culture expects a tip, even for delivery. On the other, the person is using a different cultural norm and might not know that. Also, they are a student with limited funds. But in the US, it's expected that you tip even if you pay by card. So maybe they are in the wrong for not tipping when it's customary. However, if the delivery service automatically includes a tip or if the payment method (card) makes it hard to leave a tip, that's different. The post doesn't mention if the tip was included or an option. The person might have not realized they needed to add a tip when using a card. \n\nBut in the US, when you pay by card for delivery, you can still add a tip, so not doing so might be considered inconsiderate. However, the person's reasoning is financial hardship and cultural difference. So maybe they are not in the wrong because they don't know the local customs and are being frugal. But in the US context, the expectation is to tip, so the answer might be A. Wait, but the user is from another country, which complicates things. If they were in their home country, maybe not tipping is okay, but in the US, they might be expected to follow local norms. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the delivery person relies on tips as a significant part of income, not tipping could be seen as wrong. But if the person is unaware, maybe they shouldn't be blamed. But in the US, it's part of the service, so perhaps they are in the wrong. I think the answer is A, but there's a gray area. Alternatively, B if the person is not in the wrong due to cultural differences.\n"
