      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student with limited money who usually cooks their own food but sometimes orders takeout. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, and when they pay with cash, they tip accordingly. However, when using a card, they don't tip and are now questioning if they're at fault for not tipping the delivery person.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping when paying with a card. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Typically, people add a tip when paying by card, either by adding a percentage to the total or entering a tip amount. If the payment method allows for it, the user should have included the tip. Since they didn't, they might be considered in the wrong because the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income. However, the user is in a different country where tipping is 10%, which could lead to confusion. But the question is about the US context. If they're in the US, the expectation is higher, maybe 15-20%. If they're in their home country, maybe the expectation is lower. The key is whether the user met the local tipping norms. Since they paid with a card and didn't add a tip, even if they usually do when paying cash, they didn't follow the US practice. So, they might be in the wrong because the delivery person expects a tip regardless of payment method. Alternatively, if they were unaware of the US tipping customs, maybe that's a factor. But the user acknowledges that in the US it's different, so they might be responsible for adjusting their behavior. Therefore, answer A.\n"
