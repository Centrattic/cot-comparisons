      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the delivery fee high. They're wondering if they're wrong for not tipping when they pay by card. In their country, they tip 10%, but here in the US, they're confused about the usual tipping practice. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which seems high, and they don't tip when paying with a card, which they might have done automatically with cash.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, often around 10-15%, even if there's a service fee. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard, but maybe in the US, delivery tips are expected even if there's a service charge. The user might not be aware of the US tipping culture, especially since they're a student, perhaps an international one. They also mention not tipping when paying by card, which is a different method than cash.\n\nBut is it wrong? The user is being honest about their financial situation. They're not necessarily being stingy; they just might not tip when using a card. Some people do tip via the card payment, others don't. The delivery fee is separate from the tip. The user is trying to manage their budget. However, in the US, not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair to the delivery person, especially if there's no service fee included. But the user might not know that service fee is a thing, or that it's separate.\n\nThe key points are intent and knowledge. The user doesn't know the US tipping norms and is acting based on their own country's practices. They also mention the cost is high, so they might be trying to save money. But in the US, even if there's a service fee, people often tip extra. However, if the user is unaware, maybe they're not at fault. On the other hand, if they knew the US norm and still chose not to, that's different.\n\nSince the user seems to be in a transitional phase, adjusting to a new country's practices, and they're not deliberately avoiding tipping, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the user is aware that tipping is expected but still refuses, that would make them the asshole. But the user here seems to be genuinely confused. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're not intentionally being stingy and are adjusting to a different cultural norm. However, some might argue that once in a country, one should follow local norms, so not tipping could be seen as wrong. But since the user is a student and might not be aware, it's a bit of a gray area. I think leaning towards B makes sense here.\n"
