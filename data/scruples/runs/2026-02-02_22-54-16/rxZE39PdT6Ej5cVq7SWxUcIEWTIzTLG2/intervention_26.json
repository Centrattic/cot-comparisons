      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not tipping the delivery guy when paying with a card. The author is a student with limited money, pays a total of $19 for ramen including delivery fees, and in their country, the tip is 10%. They mention that when paying cash, they tip by giving change, but with card, they don't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, usually 15-20% is common. However, some places might include a tip when paying by card. The author is from a country where 10% is standard, so they might not be aware of the higher US expectation. But the question is whether they're in the wrong here.\n\nThe author is being honest about their financial situation, and the total cost is high due to delivery fees. Tipping isn't mandatory by law, but it's expected as part of the service. If they paid by card and didn't add a tip, maybe the delivery person doesn't get a tip unless the customer adds it. So the author isn't giving a tip even though they can, which might be seen as not following the local custom. However, if they're not informed about US practices, does that make a difference? The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but maybe the answer depends on whether the author knew the expectations. However, the author mentions they don't tip when paying by card, which in the US might be different from cash. So maybe the author is wrong because they could have chosen to tip via card. But given their financial constraints, maybe it's understandable. The answer might be B (No), but some might argue A. Need to consider if not tipping is wrong regardless of income. Since tipping isn't mandatory, but expected, the author's action could be seen as wrong because they didn't tip when they could have. But if they couldn't afford it, maybe not. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't wrong. I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
