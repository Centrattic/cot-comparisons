      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention in their country it's 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip. However, when using a card, they don't, and they're wondering if that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Tipping in the US is different from some other countries. In the US, it's customary to tip service workers, especially delivery, around 15-20%, sometimes even more. Cash tips are common, but when paying with a card, some people still add a tip. The author might not be aware that in the US, delivery tips are expected regardless of payment method. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're a student with limited funds and find the total cost high. But the question is whether not tipping is wrong. The key points are understanding the local customs versus the author's own country's practices. Since they're in the US, local norms apply. If they're using a card, maybe they should still add a tip, even if small. However, the author might not know this expectation. \n\nOn one hand, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate to the delivery worker who relies on tips. On the other, the author is being honest about their financial situation. But in the US, not tipping is generally frowned upon, even for students. So the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being yes. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to balance between cultural expectations and the individual's circumstances. The answer depends on whether the author is aware of the US tipping norms and if not tipping is seen as intentional or due to lack of knowledge. Since the author mentions their country's 10% but might not know US standards, maybe there's some leeway. But the main issue is that in the US, not tipping delivery is often considered wrong regardless of payment method. So the answer might be A (in the wrong), but some might argue B. Need to decide based on typical AITA response structures. Usually, if someone is unaware but in a context where the custom is well-known, they might still be in the wrong. So probably A.\n"
