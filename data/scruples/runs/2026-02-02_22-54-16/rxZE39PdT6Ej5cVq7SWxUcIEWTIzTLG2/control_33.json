      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy.\n\nFirst, the context is that they're a student with limited money. They don't order food often, and when they do, they feel like the total cost is high because of delivery fees. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip when getting change. However, when using a card, they didn't tip. The question is whether they're wrong for not tipping in the US.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The standard tip for delivery is usually around 15-20%, though some might argue that even 10% is acceptable in certain cases. The author might be coming from a country where 10% is standard, but in the US, 10% might be seen as low or even considered below average for delivery services. \n\nThe author is paying with a card, which makes it easier to include a tip directly in the payment. Not adding a tip in this scenario could be seen as not contributing to the driver's earnings, especially if the driver relies on tips as part of their income. However, the author is struggling with the cost, paying $19 for ramen, which they find high. \n\nThe key points are the cultural expectation in the US versus the author's background, their financial situation, and the method of payment. While the author's financial constraints are valid, the expectation in the US is still to tip. Not tipping could be perceived as inconsiderate, but there's also an argument that the cost should be reasonable. However, the main issue is about the norm of tipping in the US. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't tip despite the cultural expectation, even if they're in a different situation.\n"
