      "text": "Okay, let's break down the user's question. They're a student with limited money, usually making their own food. They order occasionally but feel the delivery fees and prices are high. The main question is whether they're at fault for not tipping the delivery guy when paying by card, especially since in their home country, a 10% tip is standard but they pay cash tips there. In the US, they're paying by card and not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically 15-20%, and sometimes even added via the app. However, if they pay by card, some places allow adding a tip at checkout. If they didn't add a tip then, that's a point. But maybe the user didn't know this practice here. Also, the user is coming from a different country where they tip when paying cash. So in the US, if they pay by card and don't add a tip, that's different. However, in some US payment systems, you can't avoid adding a tip unless you specify 0%, which might be considered rude.\n\nThe user is a student with financial constraints. They mention the total cost is $19 for ramen, which might be seen as expensive. But the question is about tipping, not the price. The user's reasoning is that since they pay by card, they don't give cash tips. In their country, tipping is part of the cash transaction, so maybe they don't expect to tip when paying by card. However, in the US, even with card payments, service workers often rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could leave the delivery person with no compensation for their service.\n\nBut the user's situation is that they're not in the US originally and might not be aware of the local tipping culture. Also, they're financially constrained. The user is asking if they're at fault. The answer hinges on whether not tipping is considered wrong here. Some might say it's wrong because the delivery person expects a tip, while others might understand the user's financial situation and cultural difference.\n\nIn the US, tips are part of the service worker's pay. If the user didn't add a tip via the card payment method, they might be contributing to the worker's lower earnings. However, if the user was unaware of this system, that's a cultural difference. Still, in the US, it's expected that you tip regardless of payment method. So the act of not tipping could be seen as wrong, even if unintentional. The user is in a situation where they can't make a cash tip, but the expectation is still there. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (They are in the wrong), so answer A.\n"
