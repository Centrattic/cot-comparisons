      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds it expensive. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying by card, they don't leave a tip. They're wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In the US, tipping delivery drivers is common, often expected, and sometimes even built into the payment system. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard, so they might not be aware of different cultural norms. They also mention paying with a card, which might not include a tip automatically, unlike cash where you can give the change as a tip.\n\nThe cost of the meal is $19, which the user feels is high. They might be stretching their budget. Tipping is a way to compensate delivery workers for their service, especially since delivery fees might not cover the driver's earnings. But if the user is in a different country, the norms could vary. Wait, the question mentions the US, so maybe the user is in the US now? The original question says \"how much you usually tip in the US,\" so maybe they're a student in the US but from another country where tipping is 10%. \n\nSo, in the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers around 15-20%, especially if the order is a significant portion of their earnings. If the user isn't tipping, they might be seen as not following the local custom, which could be considered inconsiderate. However, if they're a student with limited funds, they might be trying to manage their expenses. The key here is whether not tipping is a breach of etiquette in this context.\n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. If the author is in a country where tipping is 10%, maybe they're following their own norms. However, the question is about the US, so the user might be conflating their home country's norms with the US. If they're in the US, not tipping could be seen as a problem. But if they're in their home country, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nWait, the original question is phrased as \"I don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.\" So they're in the US, possibly a student from another country. Therefore, the author is not from the US but is now in the US, where tipping is higher. In that case, they might be unaware of the higher tipping expectations. However, even if they're new, not tipping could be seen as a mistake, but not necessarily wrong if they're following their own cultural norms. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. If the author is in the US and not tipping when it's customary, they might be considered in the wrong. However, if they're struggling financially, it's a matter of personal choice. But the general etiquette in the US would expect a tip. So the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they're not following local customs, or B (not in the wrong) because they're adhering to their own culture's norms or have financial constraints.\n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural expectations and financial situation. Since the user is a student with limited funds, it's a valid reason. But the local expectation is to tip. However, it's not a legal requirement, just a social custom. So maybe they're not in the wrong, but could be seen as inconsiderate. The user's own reasoning is that they don't think they're wrong, so the answer might be B.\n"
