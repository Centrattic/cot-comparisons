AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a student with limited money. They usually make their own food but sometimes order delivery. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but when paying with card, they don't leave a tip. The total for their ramen was $19, which they think is too much. The main question is whether they're at fault for not tipping when using a card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. The standard is around 15-20%, but even 10% might be expected in some places. However, the person is from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're not used to higher expectations here.\n\nThey mention paying with a card, which might make tipping less automatic. If they're not used to it, they might forget or not know the correct amount. The total cost includes delivery, which they find high, so they might feel the price is already covering the service.\n\nBut the key point is whether they're in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all for delivery could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the delivery person is relying on tips as part of their income. However, their reasoning is that they're a student with limited funds and that the total is already high. There's a balance between cultural expectations and personal financial constraints.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the person is in a different country's system and might be adjusting. While tipping is expected, their situation shows they're making an effort to order less and manage expenses. The problem is more about the high cost and delivery fees, not necessarily their decision not to tip. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe some would say they should still tip a small amount even on a card if possible. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Given their explanation and cultural background, it's more of a misunderstanding than intentional neglect. So probably B.\n"
