      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They mention they don't order food often because they usually make their own. When they do order, they feel the total cost is high, including delivery fees. They paid with a card and didn't leave a tip. In their country, it's 10%, but they think it's absurd to pay $19 for ramen with delivery fees.\n\nNow, considering the US tipping culture. In the US, tips are customary for services, especially for delivery. While it's not legally required, many people expect a tip, usually 15-20%, especially if the service is good. The author is coming from a country where 10% is standard, but in the US, expectations are higher. Also, using a card might make tipping less obvious, but some apps or websites have a tip option built in. The author didn't mention using cash, so maybe they just didn't add a tip section on the app.\n\nThe key points here are understanding cultural differences. The author might not be aware that in the US, tips are a significant part of service workers' income. Even though they're paying with a card, the expectation is still there. However, the author is in a financial bind as a student. They might not have the means to tip, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if they knew the US tipping norms and still chose not to tip despite being able to, then maybe. But since they're a student with limited funds, it's a tough spot. The question is whether they should have tipped regardless. But the answer might depend on whether they could afford it. If they couldn't, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they just didn't consider it because of their country's norms, then maybe they are expected to adapt to local customs.\n\nAlso, the cost of the meal is an issue. $19 for ramen with delivery fees might seem high, but the tip is separate from that. So even if the total is high, the tip is still expected as a separate gesture.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is tricky. On one hand, the author didn't follow local customs. On the other, they have financial constraints. In the US, service workers rely on tips, so not tipping could affect their income. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose not to tip despite the local norm. But if they genuinely couldn't afford it, maybe not. However, the post doesn't mention that they couldn't afford it, just that they feel the cost is high. So they might have the means but just chose not to tip. Hence, answer A.\n"
