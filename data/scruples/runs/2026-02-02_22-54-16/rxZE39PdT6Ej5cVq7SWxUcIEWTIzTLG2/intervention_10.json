      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited funds. They order food occasionally and feel that the total cost, including delivery fees, is too high. They mention paying with a card, so they can't just give cash for a tip. They also note that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they do tip by giving change. Now with card payments, maybe the tip isn't as automatic.\n\nIn the US, tipping is a significant part of many service workers' income. For delivery drivers, tips can make up a big portion of their earnings since they might not earn a lot from the base pay. So even though the author is paying for the food, the driver relies on tips. \n\nBut the author argues that the total cost is high, and they can't afford to tip. They might feel that the delivery fee is supposed to cover some of that. However, in the US, delivery fees don't always account for the driver's pay. The drivers still expect tips as part of their compensation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's financial situation is a valid point. They're a student, so money is tight. Maybe they don't understand the US tipping culture fully. But if they're aware that tipping is expected and common, not tipping could be seen as withholding part of the driver's income. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of choosing to use a card where tipping isn't as straightforward. If the author had paid cash, they would have tipped. But with a card, maybe they didn't consider adding a tip. Some people might argue that it's still their responsibility to tip regardless of payment method. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they knew the norm and chose not to tip, maybe. But if they're genuinely unaware or in a financial crunch, others might be understanding. But in the US, not tipping is often seen as rude or unfair to the worker. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) with the author being in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides again.\n"
