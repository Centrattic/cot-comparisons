      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with limited money. They mention they don't order food often and usually cook themselves. When they do order, they pay with a card and don't tip, which costs them around $19 for ramen. The delivery fee is part of the cost. They note that in their country, 10% is customary, but when paying cash, they tip with change. However, since they use a card, they don't leave a tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually 10-15%, especially if there's a fee. But the author is from another country where the norm is 10%, so maybe they're not used to the US system. Also, they're a student with financial constraints. But the key point is that using a card allows for adding a tip, so maybe the author could still tip even if they don't carry cash. \n\nIs it wrong not to tip? Well, in the US, not tipping is considered rude, but if the service is poor, it's sometimes acceptable. However, the author doesn't mention any poor service. They just don't tip because they use a card and are focused on the total cost. \n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that not tipping in the US is expected only in specific situations. Since the author is aware of the 10% norm but chooses not to tip when using a card, maybe they should adjust their habit to include a tip even when paying by card. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is about financial constraints. If they can't afford it, maybe they are justified. However, if they can afford the meal, they can also afford a small tip. Also, the delivery fee is included, but the tip is separate. \n\nIn the US, delivery tips are often added to the card payment. So the author might not realize they can still tip via card. If they don't, they are leaving the delivery person without a tip, which is part of their income. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they could tip but choose not to. \n\nBut considering cultural differences and financial situation, some might be lenient. However, the standard expectation in the US is to tip, especially when using a card. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they could adjust their payment method to include a tip. Alternatively, if they can't afford a tip, then maybe not. But the author says they \"barely\" have money, but still order food, so maybe they can spare a few dollars. \n\nHmm. I think the consensus would be that they're in the wrong because they can tip if they want to support the delivery person, even if it's a small amount. Not tipping in the US is generally frowned upon unless there's a reason. So the answer is A.\n"
