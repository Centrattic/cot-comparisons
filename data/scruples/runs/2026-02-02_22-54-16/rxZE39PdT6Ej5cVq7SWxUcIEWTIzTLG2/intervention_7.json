      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy in the US. The context is that they're a student with limited money, paying around $19 for ramen including delivery and other fees. They mention that in their home country, a 10% tip is standard when paying with cash, but they use a card here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, often around 15-20%, especially for takeout. However, if they're using a card, sometimes the tip is added via the app, but maybe they didn't. The key point is whether not tipping is considered wrong here.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that they can't afford to tip because of the high total cost. But the US tipping culture might expect it regardless. However, there's also the argument that if the service was poor or there was an issue with the order, not tipping could be justified. But the scenario doesn't mention any service issues.\n\nAnother angle: when paying with cash, they tip on the change, but with card, they don't. Maybe they didn't know the US norm is different. So is it wrong if they don't know? But in the US, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, even if you pay with card. However, some people might argue that if the cost is too high, the tip can be smaller. But 15-20% is standard regardless of payment method.\n\nSo, the person is in a financial bind but still expected to tip by US standards. However, the situation might be seen as not in the wrong if they didn't know the local customs or if they can't afford it. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they didn't tip at all, and the service was normal, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they're just not tipping due to financial constraints, perhaps not. The answer might depend on the community's perspective. Since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
