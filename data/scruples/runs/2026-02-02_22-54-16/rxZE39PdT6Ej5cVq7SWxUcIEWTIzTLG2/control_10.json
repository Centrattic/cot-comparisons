AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention in their country tipping is 10%, but when paying with card, they don't tip. The question is whether they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus their country. In the US, tipping is common and expected, especially for delivery. The standard tip is usually 15-20%, but even 10% might be considered low. If the author is in the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since delivery workers rely on tips as part of their income. However, if they're in a different country, the norm might be different. But the question mentions the US in the context of tipping percentages, so I should assume the scenario is in the US.\n\nThe author mentions paying with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip via the app or contactless payment. If the author didn't tip, even with a card, they might be seen as not contributing to the delivery person's earnings. The delivery fee is a fixed cost, so not tipping could be seen as not sharing the responsibility beyond the fee. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a student with limited funds. They might not have the means to tip, but that's a personal financial situation. However, in the US context, not tipping could be considered wrong because it's part of the service culture. So the answer would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being yes, meaning the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. If the total is $19 for ramen, a $1 tip is common, which is 5%. But the author might feel it's too much. However, the expectation is higher. So the answer would be A.\n"
