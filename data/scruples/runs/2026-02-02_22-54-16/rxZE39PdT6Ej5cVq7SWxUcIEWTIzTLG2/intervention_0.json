      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is a student with limited money. They usually cook their own food but sometimes order takeout. The total cost includes a delivery fee, making the price high for the amount of food. The author is wondering if they're at fault for not tipping when paying by card. In their country, tipping is 10%, but they tip when paying cash by giving change. They paid with a card, so maybe they didn't leave a tip that way.\n\nIn the US, tipping delivery drivers is common, typically around 15-20%, especially if there's a delivery fee. But the author's situation is different\u2014they come from a country where 10% is standard and they only tip when paying cash. Paying by card might have made it harder for them to leave a tip, or maybe they didn't know the US norms.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, in the US, not tipping could be seen as rude because delivery workers rely on tips. The total might seem high, but the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author might not realize that the delivery fee doesn't cover the tip. So, not tipping could be considered wrong by US standards.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a different cultural context where tipping norms are lower. They might not be aware of US practices. Also, their financial situation is tight, making the high total seem unfair. They might feel they're being asked to pay twice\u2014once for the food and delivery, then again for a tip. If they didn't know how to tip via card (like through an app or adding a tip at checkout), that could be a factor.\n\nBut the key point is the expectation in the US versus their own country. The author might not have intended to be rude, just unaware. However, since they are now in the US (assuming the context is the US), they might need to adapt to local customs. The delivery fee is separate, so expecting the tip to be part of that might be a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the community's opinion is that tipping is expected regardless, then yes. But if they're excused due to cultural differences and lack of knowledge, maybe not. The answer hinges on whether the expectation in the US is so strong that not tipping is wrong, regardless of the reason.\n"
