AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they don't order food much, and when they do, they pay with a card. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they give the tip with the change. However, when using a card, they didn't tip because they felt the total was already high for the amount of food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Tipping is customary for delivery in the US, often around 15-20%, especially if the service is good. But the person is coming from a different cultural background where 10% is standard and tipping isn't automatic with card payments. They might not be aware of US practices. \n\nAlso, they're a student with financial constraints. They might not have the means to tip, especially if the total is already high. The delivery fee is included, making the cost seem steep for the value received. \n\nHowever, in the US, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings. But the author might not have known that tipping is expected even with card payments. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on the context. If they were unaware of the tipping culture, it's understandable. Plus, their financial situation is a factor. But if they knew or should have known, maybe they are at fault. However, since they mentioned their country's practice and financial constraints, it's more a misunderstanding than intentional. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
