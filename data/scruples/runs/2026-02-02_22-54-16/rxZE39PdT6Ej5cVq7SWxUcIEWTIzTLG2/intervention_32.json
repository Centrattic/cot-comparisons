AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the delivery fees high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they use a card, they don't tip. The total came out to $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often expected around 15-20% or more. However, the author is from a country where it's 10% with cash. They might not be aware of US tipping practices. Also, they're a student with financial constraints, so maybe they can't afford to tip as much as locals. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The author isn't being intentionally stingy; they have a different background and might not realize the expectation here. Also, they're using a card, which makes tipping less automatic since cash isn't involved. However, some argue that even with a card, a tip should be added through the app or at checkout. If the app allows for tip entry, not including any could be seen as not tipping. But if the app doesn't have that option, maybe it's less expected.\n\nAnother angle: the total cost being $19 for ramen might seem high, but that includes delivery fees. The author might feel the price is already too much, so not tipping is a way to save. But in the US, delivery fees and tips are separate. The delivery fee goes to the company, while tips go to the driver. So maybe the author isn't accounting for the tip as part of the total cost.\n\nHowever, the key factors are the author's awareness of US tipping norms and their financial situation. Since they mention it's different in their country and they're a student with limited funds, it's possible they didn't intend to be rude. So, are they in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If they knew the norm and chose not to tip despite being able to, then maybe yes. But if they genuinely didn't know, and their financial situation is tight, then no. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because intent and circumstances matter.\n"
