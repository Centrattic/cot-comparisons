Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student with limited funds who usually cooks their own food. They occasionally order takeout, but find the total cost, including delivery fees, to be high. The question is whether not tipping the delivery driver makes them \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, often around 15-20%, especially for services like delivery. The author mentions their home country uses 10%, but they're in the US now. They paid by card, which might make tipping less automatic, but the main issue is whether they should tip despite the high total.\n\nThe key points are financial constraints and cultural norms. The author is being honest about their situation and might not have the means to tip as much as expected. However, some might argue that tipping is part of the service cost and necessary for the worker's income. Others might empathize with their situation, especially since they already find the total price steep. \n\nConsidering the author's explanation and the context of being a student with limited funds, it's reasonable to say they're not in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their circumstances and might not be aware of US tipping norms. So, answer B.\n"
