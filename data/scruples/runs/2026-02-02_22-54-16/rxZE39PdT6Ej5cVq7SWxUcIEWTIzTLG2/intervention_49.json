AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is set in the US, where tipping is customary, but the person is a student with limited money. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but they're confused because in the US, the delivery fee is separate and they end up paying a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is part of the service culture. Delivery drivers often rely on tips because their wages might be lower, and the delivery fee doesn't always cover their pay. So, not tipping could be seen as not following the local custom here.\n\nThe person is a student and spends $19 on ramen, which they consider expensive. They might not have the means to tip, but they also might not be aware that in the US, even small tips are expected. However, the fact that they pay with a card and don't tip, compared to when they use cash and give a 10% tip, might be a key point. If they're using cash, they do tip, but when using a card, they don't. That could be a mistake in understanding how card payments work for tipping\u2014maybe the card system requires adding a tip electronically, or the driver expects it. Alternatively, maybe the person isn't aware that tips are expected regardless of payment method.\n\nAnother angle is the cost breakdown. The person mentions the delivery fee and ends up paying a lot. If the total includes delivery, maybe the tip is on top of that. So, even if the food is not expensive, the total cost might make a small tip seem reasonable. But from the person's perspective, they're already paying a high amount, so the tip feels like an extra burden.\n\nLegal or ethical obligations? In the US, there's no legal requirement to tip, but it's a strong social norm. Not tipping could be seen as disrespectful or unfair to the worker. However, if the person is genuinely struggling financially, some might argue that it's understandable, but others might still expect a tip as part of the service.\n\nThe person is self-aware, acknowledging they don't have much money. They're comparing their home country's 10% to US practices. This shows they're trying to adapt but might not fully grasp the local expectations. In that case, maybe they're not in the wrong for not knowing, but they should still tip to support the worker.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the main issue is lack of awareness, but A (in the wrong) if the social norm is so strong that not tipping is considered wrong regardless. However, since the person is a student with limited funds and might not have the means to tip, maybe the answer leans towards B. But in the US context, not tipping is generally frowned upon, so maybe A. Hmm, it's a bit tricky. I need to weigh the cultural expectations against the individual's circumstances. Since the user is in the US and the norm is to tip, not doing so could be seen as wrong even if they're in a tight spot. So, the answer would be A.\n"
