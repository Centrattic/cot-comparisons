AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The context is that they're a student with limited money, and they're paying with a card. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but in the US, maybe different. The main points to consider here are the cultural norms in the US about tipping and the financial situation of the person.\n\nFirst, in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. The usual amount is around 15-20%, but some people might tip less or not at all if they can't afford it. The person here is a student and mentions they barely order food, so their financial situation is tight. They're paying with a card, which might make it harder to leave a tip compared to cash. So maybe they didn't know they could add a tip online or through the app when paying with a card.\n\nAnother angle is the delivery fee. The person feels the total is too high with the delivery fee included. Maybe they didn't account for the tip as part of the cost. Also, in some places, the tip is automatically added, but if they paid with a card and didn't include it, maybe they didn't realize they should add it. The question is whether not tipping is wrong in this case.\n\nThe person isn't in a position where they can easily tip, given their financial constraints and the payment method. The US tipping culture is part of the service workers' pay, so not tipping could affect their income. However, the person isn't malicious; they're just struggling financially. So there's a balance between cultural expectations and personal circumstances.\n\nI think the key here is whether the person intended to not tip or didn't know how. If they were unaware that tips could be added with a card payment, maybe they're not at fault. But if they knew the norm and chose not to tip despite being able to, then they'd be in the wrong. The situation says they paid with a card and didn't mention knowing how much is typical in the US. They might have been confused about the expectations. Considering all that, the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong, because they're a student in a different country, and maybe they didn't know the US tipping norms or how to apply them with a card payment.\n"
