AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student who doesn't have a lot of money and usually makes their own food. They occasionally order takeout but find the total, including delivery fees, expensive. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping the delivery person when paying by card. \n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, often around 15-20% for services like delivery. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard. They mentioned that when paying cash, they tip with change, but with a card, they don't. The delivery fee is separate, making the total $19 for ramen. \n\nThe user is in a tight financial situation. Tipping via card can sometimes be optional, but not tipping at all might be seen as inconsiderate. However, given their financial constraints and cultural background, they might not see it as necessary. The delivery fee is part of the price, so maybe the user feels the fee covers the delivery, hence no extra tip needed. \n\nBut in the US context, tips are expected as part of the delivery person's income. Even with financial hardship, not tipping could be frowned upon. On the other hand, the user isn't in the US and might not be aware of local customs. Also, the total cost is high due to fees, which might make them reluctant to add a tip.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user's intent isn't malicious. They're being honest about their situation and cultural background. While the US norm is to tip, the user's actions might not be entirely in the wrong given their perspective and circumstances. So, the answer might be B.\n"
