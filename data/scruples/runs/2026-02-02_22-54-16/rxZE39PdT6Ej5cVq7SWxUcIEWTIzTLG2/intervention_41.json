      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a student with limited money. They usually don't order food because they make it themselves. When they do order, the total ends up high because of delivery fees. They paid with a card, and since in their country they tip 10% when paying cash, they didn't tip when using a card. They paid $19 for ramen, which they find expensive, and are wondering if not tipping is wrong here.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nIn the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, even though it's not mandatory. However, the situation here has some nuances. The author is a student with financial constraints, which might affect their ability to tip. They mention that in their country, tipping is done with cash, so maybe they're not used to the US system where tipping is expected regardless of payment method. \n\nBut here's the thing: in the US, when you pay with a card for delivery services, you can add a tip at the time of payment. If they didn't do that, they might be seen as not tipping. However, if the delivery person didn't ask for a tip or there was no option to add it through the app, that's different. The scenario doesn't specify if they had the option to tip via card. \n\nAlso, the cost of $19 for ramen with delivery fees might be on the higher side, but that's the business's pricing. The author's financial situation is a factor, but in the US, tipping is part of the service cost, so even if the total seems high, not tipping could be considered not meeting the social norm. However, if the author wasn't aware of the tipping expectation when using a card, maybe they're not at fault for not knowing. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not tipping is inconsiderate, especially since delivery workers often rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. The author's justification is that they don't tip when using a card because of their home country's practices, which could be a cultural misunderstanding. \n\nBut in the US, tipping is expected regardless of payment method. So even if the author didn't have much money, the expectation is to include a tip when paying with a card. If they didn't, they might be considered in the wrong because they didn't follow the local custom. However, if they were genuinely unaware of the expectation, maybe that lessens the blame. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's financial constraints, 2) Cultural differences in tipping practices, 3) Whether the payment method allowed for tipping. Since the scenario doesn't mention if they had the option to tip via card, it's hard to say. But assuming they could have added a tip, then not doing so might be seen as wrong. However, if they didn't know, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the ability to tip when using a card and whether the expectation was clear. Since the author didn't mention adding a tip in the scenario, it's possible they didn't, which in the US context would mean they're in the wrong. But considering their student status and cultural background, maybe it's a nuanced case. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. In the US, not tipping for delivery is generally frowned upon, so the answer might lean towards A, but given the circumstances, perhaps B is more appropriate. Wait, but in the US, it's a social norm regardless of payment method. So if they didn't tip, they are in the wrong. Hence, answer A. But the user thinks B. I need to consider both. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B because the author is a student with limited funds and there's cultural context. But in the US, you can't avoid tipping by using a card. So maybe they are in the wrong. I'm torn. Let me check similar AITA scenarios. Often, people are called not the asshole if there's a financial hardship or cultural misunderstanding. So maybe B. But in the US, expecting to tip is part of the system. If they didn't tip, even if it's cultural, it's still not following the local norm. But if they were unaware, maybe they're not at fault. So perhaps B. The answer is B.\n"
