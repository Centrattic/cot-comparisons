      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with little money, usually cook their own food, and only order when they want to. The total came to $19 for ramen, which seems high to them. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but they paid with a card here, so maybe they think the tip should be part of the card payment. But in the US, tipping is usually expected regardless of payment method, and sometimes even added automatically. The person didn't tip, so the question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus the person's home country. In the US, not tipping could be seen as rude, especially for delivery. Delivery drivers rely on tips because their base pay might be low. The total of $19 includes delivery fee and food, so not tipping might take a bigger chunk of the driver's earnings. Even though the person is a student and has financial constraints, the expectation in the US might be that tipping is part of the transaction, regardless of payment method. However, some people might argue that if the person isn't used to the local customs, they might not know to tip when using a card. But generally, in the US, a tip is expected, and not giving it could be considered wrong. So the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) meaning they are in the wrong. But maybe the student's situation is understandable, but the norm is still to tip. The key points are the cultural expectation versus the individual's circumstances. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
