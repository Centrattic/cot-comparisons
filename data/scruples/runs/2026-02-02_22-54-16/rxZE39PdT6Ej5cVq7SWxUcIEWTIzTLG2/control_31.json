When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and doesn't tip when paying by card. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but when paying cash, they tip when getting change. They feel it's too expensive to tip when paying by card because the total ends up high. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. The user is in the US, where tipping is common, but they're from a different country where 10% is standard. However, in the US, especially for delivery, tips are often expected even if not mandatory. The delivery person might rely on tips as part of their income.\n\nThe user argues they can't afford to tip because the total is already high. But in the US, delivery fees and tips are often separate. Even with a card payment, the user might still be expected to add a tip. Not tipping could be seen as withholding a customary part of the payment that the delivery person counts on. \n\nHowever, the user's financial situation is a factor. They're a student with limited funds. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all might be frowned upon, but maybe there's some understanding if the customer is paying via card and the tip isn't automatic. Still, the expectation exists. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the US norm considers tipping as necessary regardless of payment method. Since the user didn't tip, and in the US it's customary, even if they don't have much money, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the options are A or B. The user didn't tip, and in the US, it's expected. So A would be the answer.\n"
