      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is a student with limited funds. They usually make their own food but occasionally order takeout. The delivery fee is high, and they feel like they're paying a lot for not much food. They're wondering if they should tip the delivery person when paying with a card. In their country, the standard tip is 10%, but when paying cash, they tip with the change. They think $19 for ramen is absurd.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not tipping. Let's consider the US tipping culture. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, and even more if the service is good. However, when paying by card, some people add the tip digitally. The writer might not be aware of the US norms since they mention their country's 10% rate. \n\nBut here's the thing: in the US, not tipping at all, even with a card, could be considered impolite. The writer is a student with limited funds, which might be a valid reason for not tipping as much as they normally would in their home country. However, the expectation in the US is different. The delivery fee is separate from the tip, and the tip is supposed to be a gratuity for the service. \n\nThe writer is concerned about the total cost, but they might not realize that the tip is part of the service cost. Even if the delivery fee is high, the tip is an additional part that drivers rely on. So, while the writer is in a tight financial situation, not tipping at all could be seen as not following the local norm. However, the amount they're paying (19$ for ramen) might be a factor. If the base price is high, maybe the tip is expected to be lower, but typically, the tip is calculated on the total (food + delivery fee), unless the platform automatically adds a tip. \n\nThe key points here are understanding the local customs and the writer's financial situation. If in the US, not tipping is frowned upon regardless of the payment method, then the writer is in the wrong. But if they're a foreign student not aware of US norms, maybe they're not fully at fault. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong, so I need to consider the general consensus. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer being in the wrong (A) because in the US, not tipping is generally considered rude, even if you're paying by card. The fact that they are a student with limited money might be a mitigating factor, but the expectation is still there. Alternatively, some might argue that since they're not in the US, they might not know the norms, but the question is in the context of the US. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
