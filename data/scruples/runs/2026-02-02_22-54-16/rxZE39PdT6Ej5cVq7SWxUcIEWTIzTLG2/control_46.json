      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery and tip) to be high. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying with cash, they tip when they get change. However, when using a card, they don't tip, and now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. The standard is usually 15-20%, but can vary. The author is from a country where 10% is the norm, which is lower than the US standard. That's a key point. The question is whether the author is wrong for not tipping when paying with a card.\n\nThe user also mentions paying $19 for ramen, which seems high. The delivery fee and service charge might be part of that. In some places, delivery apps or restaurants add a service fee, which can be mistaken for a tip. But if the author didn't add a tip on top of that, they might be underpaying in the US context.\n\nHowever, the author isn't in the US. The question is about whether they're in the wrong, but the scenario is set in the US. The user might be confused because they're used to a different tipping norm. But if they're in the US, following local customs is expected. If they're in their home country, then the local 10% might be acceptable. The post doesn't specify the location, but the mention of the US in the question suggests the context is the US.\n\nAlso, when paying with a card, many people still tip. If the author didn't tip because they don't have cash, that's a reason, but in the US, tipping via card is common. The author could adjust the total before paying with the card. So not tipping might be seen as not following local customs, even if they're a student with limited funds.\n\nBut the author is a student with limited money, so maybe they're not in the wrong for trying to save. However, the expectation in the US is that delivery drivers rely on tips. So not tipping could be considered wrong as it affects the driver's income. The answer might depend on the local norms and the author's awareness of them.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author is in the US and not tipping when it's expected, they might be in the wrong. But if they're in their home country and following local norms, maybe not. Since the post is asking about the US context, the answer is likely A. However, if they're not in the US, then B. But the question is framed as if the scenario is in the US. So the answer is A.\n"
