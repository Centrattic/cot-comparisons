AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally but usually cooks. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, which they do when paying cash. However, when paying by card, they don't tip, leading to a total of $19 for ramen. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn the US, tipping for delivery can vary. Some people tip, some don't, especially if they feel the service wasn't great. But generally, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. The person here is justifying not tipping because they're a student and the cost is high. They might not be in the wrong if they can't afford it. However, some might argue that even a small tip is appreciated. \n\nBut the key points are: the user is financially constrained, the total cost already includes a delivery fee, and they tip when paying cash. Since they're using a card, maybe they don't have change to tip. In the US, tipping isn't mandatory, so not tipping isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their situation.\n"
