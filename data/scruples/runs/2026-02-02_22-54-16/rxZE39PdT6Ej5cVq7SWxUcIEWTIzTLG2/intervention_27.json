      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. They don't order food often, usually cooking their own. When they do order, they end up paying a lot including delivery fees, and they feel it's unreasonable to pay $19 for ramen. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but since they pay with a card, they don't give a tip. The question is whether they are in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, even if you pay with a card. Some places might expect a tip, either automatically added or left by the customer. However, the author is from a country where the norm is 10%, but in the US, it's often 15-20% for services. But wait, the author is in the US, right? The post starts with \"I don't know how much you usually tip in the US...\" So they're a non-US person in the US, maybe a student there.\n\nThey paid with a card, so maybe they didn't have change to leave a tip as they do in cash. In the US, when you pay with a card, you can add a tip via the terminal, or the restaurant might include a tip. But if they didn't do that, maybe the delivery person didn't get a tip. However, the author might not be aware of the US tipping norms, especially if they're new there.\n\nThe key points here are: the person is a student with limited funds, the total cost seems high to them, they're not used to the US tipping system, and they didn't leave a tip. The question is if they're wrong for that.\n\nIn the US, delivery tips are often expected, even if you pay with a card. So if they didn't leave a tip, the delivery person might not get compensated properly. However, the author's financial situation is tight, and they might not know the local customs. But the responsibility is on the customer to know local practices, especially when they're a student in the US. However, if the restaurant automatically added a tip, then the author might not be at fault. But the post says they paid with their card and didn't mention a tip. So maybe they didn't add it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they knew the US norm was higher and chose not to tip despite having the means (even if limited), then maybe. But the author is struggling to make ends meet. However, the argument that they should have known the tipping culture applies. The answer could be nuanced. But in an AITA context, the community might consider that the person is not in the wrong if they genuinely couldn't afford it, but others might argue they should have left a small tip regardless.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author knew about the US tipping norms. If they didn't and it's their first time, maybe they're not at fault. However, as a student in the US, they should be aware that tipping is part of the service industry. So maybe they are in the wrong. But the community might be sympathetic given their financial situation. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they have limited funds and the total was high, but others might say A. Hmm. I need to decide based on the information given. The author didn't leave a tip, but their reasoning is about cost and not knowing the US norm. If in their country it's 10%, but in the US, higher, they might not be aware. So maybe B is correct. But the fact that they paid with card and didn't add a tip when they could have, even a small amount, might lead to A. I'm a bit torn. But since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and considering the financial constraints, I'll go with B.\n"
