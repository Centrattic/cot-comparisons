      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost, including delivery and tip, too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with cash, they tip. However, they pay with a card and didn't tip, leading to $19 for ramen. The question is whether this is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a student with financial constraints. They don't order food often, so maybe they're not familiar with US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for service, and while some might argue that delivery drivers rely on tips, others might understand if a customer is struggling. The cost is highlighted as $19 for ramen, which seems steep, so the author might feel the price already includes service. However, in the US, delivery fees and tips are usually separate, so not tipping might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the cost is high. \n\nBut the author mentions they tip when using cash, which suggests they are trying to be considerate when possible. Paying with a card might be a new situation for them, and they may not know that tipping is expected even with card payments. The key factors here are intent, awareness of local norms, and financial constraints. If the author didn't tip because they didn't know it was expected, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they were aware but chose not to tip, that's different. The story suggests they are aware (since they mention 10% in their country) but maybe not the US practice. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee is mentioned as part of the high cost, which might make the author feel the service is already paid for. However, in the US, the delivery fee is often for the company, and tips go to the driver. So the author's reasoning might not align with local expectations. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had knowledge that tipping is expected in the US for delivery services. If they didn't know, they might not be in the wrong. The fact that they tip when using cash suggests they are trying to be polite, but perhaps didn't realize that even with card payments, tipping is expected. However, some might argue that being aware of the US norm (since they mentioned their country's 10%) means they should have known better. \n\nOn balance, the author's financial situation and the fact that they tip when possible could lean towards not being in the wrong. But the expectation in the US is that you tip regardless of payment method. So there's a conflict here between personal circumstances and local customs. The answer might be a nuanced \"Not the AITA\" because they are unaware or in a difficult financial position, but technically, they didn't follow the norm. However, considering their intent and effort to tip when possible, maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the act of not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate regardless. \n\nI think the answer is A, they are in the wrong because in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service, and not tipping, even if you pay by card, is considered rude. Financial constraints don't negate the cultural expectation. However, some might argue the other way, but in the US context, the answer is likely A.\n"
