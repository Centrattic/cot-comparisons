AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The user is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and pays by card. In their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying by cash, they tip when they get change. They find the total cost (including delivery fee) of $19 for ramen a bit high.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping culture. In the US, tipping is customary for service jobs, including delivery. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it can vary. The user might not be aware of this expectation because they're used to a different system where tipping is 10% or done when paying cash. Since they pay by card, maybe the system doesn't allow for cash tips, so they might not know if they can add a tip there. Also, the total cost seems high to them, which might make them reluctant to tip extra.\n\nHowever, even if they're a student with limited funds, the expectation in the US is that tips are part of the total cost. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to the delivery person's income, which is part of their pay. The delivery fee might cover the driver's base pay, but tips are still expected as a service charge. The user might be under the impression that the delivery fee is enough, but that's not typically the case.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is making a conscious choice to not tip because they find the cost already high. They might not have malicious intent and are just trying to manage their money. However, in US norms, not tipping is considered rude and unfair to the delivery worker. So while they might not be \"in the wrong\" in a legal sense, socially they could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The user is not in a position where they can't afford a tip, just that they're being mindful of their expenses. The answer might depend on cultural understanding. If they're unaware of the US tipping norms, they might not be at fault. However, if they are aware and choose not to tip anyway, that's different. The scenario suggests they might not know the standard expectations, which could mitigate their responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, they're not in the wrong) because of their limited funds and possible lack of awareness about US tipping practices. However, some might argue that once you're in a country where tipping is expected, you should follow local norms regardless of personal financial situations. But the key here is the user's intent and circumstances. They're a student, paying by card, and might not know how to tip when using a card. The total cost being high from their perspective also plays a role. Therefore, while the norm is to tip, the user's situation might not make them in the wrong.\n"
