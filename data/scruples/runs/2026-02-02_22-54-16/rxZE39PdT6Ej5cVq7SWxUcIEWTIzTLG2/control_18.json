      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. They're a student with limited money, right? They usually make their own food but sometimes order takeout. The problem is they didn't tip the delivery guy when paying by card. The question is whether that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user mentions their country typically tips 10%, but they're asking about the US. In the US, tipping for delivery can vary. Some people tip because delivery drivers often have low base pay, but others might not tip as much as for in-person service. However, many delivery services now have an option to tip through the app, and sometimes the delivery fee includes a portion for the driver. \n\nThe user is paying with a card, so maybe they don't get the opportunity to tip in cash as they would in their home country. But in the US, even when paying by card, there's usually a tip entry on the receipt or through the app. If the user didn't add a tip there, they might be missing a chance to contribute. Also, the delivery fee might not cover the driver's wages adequately, so not tipping could mean the driver gets less. \n\nThe user is upset about the total cost being $19 for ramen. Maybe they feel the delivery fee is already high, but if the tip is part of the total, not including it could be seen as not contributing to the driver's pay. However, the user's financial situation is a factor. They can't afford to tip as much as they do in cash transactions. \n\nSo, is it wrong? If in the US, the expectation is to tip delivery drivers, even when paying by card, then not tipping could be considered inconsiderate. However, if the user is genuinely unable to afford it, maybe the situation is different. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on the cultural expectations. In the US, tipping is part of the service cost. Not tipping might be seen as wrong because the driver relies on it. But the user's financial constraints are valid. However, since they are in the US, they should adapt to local customs. So, they might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if it's a small amount.\n"
