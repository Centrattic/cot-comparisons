AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip a delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and found the total cost, including delivery fee, to be high. They mention they usually tip 10% in their country but when paying by card, they didn't tip. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, even if paying by card. However, the user is from a country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware of US tipping practices. But they are in the US now, so maybe they should adapt. However, they mention the total cost being high. The delivery fee is separate, but the tip is part of the total they pay. If they didn't tip, the delivery person might rely on that tip as part of their income. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a financial bind as a student. They might not be able to afford the tip. But is it their responsibility to tip regardless? Some argue that the business includes a service charge, but if it's not included, the customer is expected to tip. If the user is paying by card and the option isn't there, maybe they should set aside cash for tips. But they don't have a lot of money. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? If the norm in the US is to tip, even with card payments, and they didn't, they might be considered in the wrong. But if their knowledge is from their home country, maybe they're not at fault. However, being in the US, they should research local customs. The high cost might be an excuse, but it's not a reason. The user's perspective is that they're not in the US, but the question is about the US context. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the user being in the wrong because in the US, tips are expected and part of the worker's pay. Even if you're using a card, the option to tip is usually there. If they didn't know, that's a reason, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they didn't tip, and in the US, it's customary, they are at fault. Answer A.\n"
