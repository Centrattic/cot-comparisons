AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. They mentioned being a student with limited funds, ordering food once in a while, and finding it expensive. They also note that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they're in the US now. \n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, especially for services like delivery, a tip is usually expected. The common range is 15-20%, but for delivery, maybe a bit less because it's not as direct as restaurant service. But some people still tip around 15% there. The user paid with a card, which might make it easier to include a tip automatically, but they didn't.\n\nThey paid $19 for ramen, which seems high. However, the question is about whether not tipping is wrong. The author's reasoning is that they can't afford it, given their student status. But in the US, tipping is part of the service workers' income. Even if the total seems steep, the expectation is that you tip. So, even if it's hard, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate to the delivery person who relies on that.\n\nBut there are arguments both ways. If the user can't afford to tip, maybe they should avoid ordering when possible. However, if they're a student and this is a rare occurrence, maybe the delivery person would understand. But generally, the US culture expects tipping, so not doing so might be considered wrong. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite knowing the norm. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to their financial situation. However, the question is about societal expectations. The answer likely leans towards A.\n"
