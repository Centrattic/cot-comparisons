AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. They usually make their own food but sometimes order when they want to. They mention that the delivery fee plus the order makes the total high, like $19 for ramen. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re at fault for not tipping when paying by card. In their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they give cash tips when possible. Since they use a card, maybe the tip isn't automatic, so they didn't add it.\n\nIn the US, tipping is common, especially for service workers like delivery drivers. Some places allow adding a tip through the app when paying by card, but maybe the author didn't know or didn't have the option. The key points are their financial situation and whether they had the means to tip. If they could have added a tip via the payment method and didn't, maybe they're expected to. However, if the app didn't let them include a tip, then they might not be in the wrong. Also, considering they're a student with limited funds, maybe the community would be more lenient. But in the US, leaving no tip is often seen as rude, even if the total is high. So there's a balance between their financial constraints and cultural expectations. I think the answer might be B, but I'm not sure if the method of payment matters here.\n"
