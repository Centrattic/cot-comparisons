Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a student who doesn't order food often because they make their own. When they do, they use a delivery service that charges a delivery fee, making the total higher. They paid with a card and didn't tip, asking if they're at fault.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, usually around 15-20% for delivery, even if paying by card. But the user is from a country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware of the US tipping culture. Also, they mention the total being $19 for ramen, which seems high because of the delivery fee, which might affect their perception of the tip's necessity.\n\nThe user is in a tight financial situation, being a student. They might not have the extra money to tip, especially since they don't order often. However, not tipping could be seen as disrespectful to the delivery person in the US context. But considering the user's circumstances and cultural background, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key points are cultural differences, financial constraints, and awareness of local customs. So, while tipping is expected, the user's lack of knowledge and financial situation could mitigate the blame.\n"
