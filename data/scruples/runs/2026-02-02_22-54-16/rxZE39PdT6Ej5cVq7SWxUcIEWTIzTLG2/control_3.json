      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is at fault. They're a student with limited money, and they mention the US tipping culture versus their own country's 10% standard. They paid with a card and didn't tip, leading to a $19 ramen order.\n\nFirst, in the US, tipping is customary for delivery, usually around 15-20%. The delivery fee might be separate, but the total could still be high. The author might not be aware that even when paying by card, a tip is expected. In their home country, tipping with cash is easier, but in the US, the system is different. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on the context. If they knew the cultural expectation, then not tipping could be seen as wrong. However, if they were unaware and made an honest mistake, maybe not. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they had the knowledge that in the US tipping is different and chose not to tip despite the higher total, maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if they had a valid reason like financial hardship, it's debatable. But the community might expect them to still tip a small amount if possible. So the answer might be A, but some might say B. Hmm.\n"
