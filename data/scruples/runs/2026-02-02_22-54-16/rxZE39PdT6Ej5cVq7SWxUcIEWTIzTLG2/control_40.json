      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is a student with limited money. They usually don't order food, but when they do, the total ends up being high because of the delivery fee. They paid with a card and didn't tip. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but they're in the US now where tipping norms might be different. They felt the final price was too much for the food they got.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, it's customary to tip delivery drivers, typically 15-20%, especially if the food is expensive. However, the person is a student with limited funds and the total cost after delivery fee is $19 for ramen, which might seem low. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the total is low, the expectation in the US is that you tip. Whether you pay cash or card, you're supposed to leave a tip. The author didn't tip, even though they have the option to add a tip with their card. Some might argue that the delivery fee is separate from the tip, and the author should have included a tip regardless. Others might sympathize because they're a student and the total was high. \n\nHowever, the main point is that in the US, not tipping is considered rude, regardless of the amount. The author didn't tip even though they paid with a card, which allows for adding a tip. So, even if they're tight on money, the expectation is there. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). But maybe some people would say B because the situation is understandable. But according to the norms, the answer is likely A.\n"
