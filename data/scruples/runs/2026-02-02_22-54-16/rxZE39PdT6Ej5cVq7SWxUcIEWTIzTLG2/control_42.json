      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the student is on a tight budget, orders food occasionally, pays with a card, and doesn't tip because in their home country, tipping is 10%, which they do when paying cash. They find the total price high for the food they get.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural differences. The writer is from a country where 10% tipping is standard, but the scenario is set in the US, where tipping practices can vary. In the US, especially for services like delivery, it's common to tip around 15-20%, sometimes even more for good service. However, some places might have built-in tips, but the user mentions a separate delivery fee. So, in the US context, not tipping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially since the delivery fees might not go entirely to the driver. \n\nThe user is a student with limited funds. They pay by card, which might make tipping less automatic than when using cash. When paying cash, they give a 10% tip, but with a card, they don't. This shows they are aware of tipping norms but choose not to when using a card. However, the US tipping culture isn't strictly 10%, so expecting a 10% tip might not be enough here. \n\nThe total cost being high for the food might contribute to their frustration, but that's a separate issue. The delivery fee could be separate from the tip. Even if the total is high, the tip is a separate gesture to compensate the delivery person for their work. \n\nSo, in the US, not tipping at all (even 10%) might be considered wrong because the expectation is higher. The writer's justification is cultural, but if they're in the US, they should adapt to local norms. Therefore, the answer might be AITA yes (A for author is in the wrong). But some might argue they're in a tight budget and trying to adapt. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about deserving sympathy. \n\nAnother angle: if the user is in the US, they should follow US tipping customs. Even if they come from a country with 10%, in the US, 15-20% is standard for good service. So not tipping at all is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
