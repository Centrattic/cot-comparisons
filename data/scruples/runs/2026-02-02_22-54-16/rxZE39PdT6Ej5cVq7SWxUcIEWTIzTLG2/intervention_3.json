      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high for the amount of food they get. They mention that in their country, 10% is typical, but when paying with a card, they don't give a tip. The total came to $19 for ramen noodles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of tipping in the US. Tipping is common for service workers, including delivery drivers, and many people see it as part of the service cost. However, the author is a student with financial constraints. The question is whether not tipping is wrong in this scenario.\n\nIn the US, while tipping is customary, it's not always mandatory. Some people argue that if the service is good, a tip is expected, but if the service is poor, they might not tip. However, the author's situation is more about affordability. They pay with a card and might not have cash on hand, which could make tipping harder. But with card payments, many delivery apps allow adding a tip digitally, so the lack of cash shouldn't be a barrier.\n\nThe author might not be aware that in the US, a 15-20% tip is common for delivery, which could add up to $3-$4 on a $19 order. However, the author's reasoning is that in their country, 10% is standard. But they're in the US now, so adapting to local norms might be expected. On the other hand, if the delivery service is included in the total with a fee, maybe they feel the tip is redundant or the fees are already high. \n\nThe key points are financial constraints and the expectation of tipping. If the author can't afford to tip, but still can afford the meal, some might say they should still tip if they can. Others might argue that the high cost of the meal (including delivery fees) is unreasonable, so the author isn't at fault for not tipping. \n\nI need to balance between the social norm of tipping in the US and the individual's financial situation. The author isn't being disrespectful or intentionally avoiding their responsibility due to laziness, but rather due to economic hardship. However, service workers rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could impact them negatively. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a case for both sides. The author's situation is understandable, but in the US context, not tipping might be seen as inconsiderate. But given their financial constraints, it's not entirely their fault. The answer hinges on whether the financial hardship excuses not tipping. Since the user says they're a student with limited money and only order occasionally, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So the answer might be B, Not in the wrong.\n"
