      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but when paying by card they don't tip, which is different from when they use cash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping for delivery is usually expected, even though it's not as common as in-person dining. People often tip between 10-20%, especially if the delivery was good. However, the author is paying with a card, which might make it less automatic than cash. Some people might not tip if they're paying digitally, especially if they're not used to it. \n\nThe author is a student with limited funds. They're paying $19 for ramen, which includes delivery fees. That's a significant amount for them. They might feel pressured because they already pay delivery fees and see tipping as an extra cost they can't afford. But in the US, delivery tips are part of the service, not just a voluntary gesture. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect here. The author is from a country where 10% is standard, but in the US, tipping practices can vary. The author might not be aware that even with a card, a tip is expected. Also, if they're paying with a card, maybe they can set a lower tip percentage, but they choose not to tip at all. \n\nSo is the author in the wrong? If the US norm is to tip delivery, even with a card, then not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the author is unaware or in a financial bind, some might understand. However, the expectation is still there, so the answer might lean towards A (yes, they're in the wrong). But others might argue B (no) due to financial constraints and cultural differences.\n"
