AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they usually cook their own food, and when they do order\u5916\u5356, they end up paying a lot including delivery fees. They mention that in their country, it's 10%, but they pay with a card, so maybe they don't have change to give cash tips. They paid $19 for ramen, which they think is a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms in the US. Tipping is customary there, usually around 15-20% for service. But the person is coming from a country where it's 10%, so maybe they're not used to it. Also, since they use a card, they can't give cash tips, but many places now have options to add a tip through the card payment. Maybe the delivery guy expects a tip, especially if the delivery fee doesn't include it. \n\nThe user might be thinking that since they paid with a card, they didn't have to give a tip, but in the US, even with card payments, it's expected to include a tip. If the app or website doesn't have an option to add a tip, maybe the delivery person is left without any. However, if the payment system allows adding a tip, then not doing so could be seen as not tipping. \n\nAlso, the cost of the meal and delivery fee might be high, but that doesn't necessarily mean the tip is justified. The delivery person's job might require them to rely on tips as part of their income. Not tipping could affect their earnings. But the user is a student with limited funds, so maybe they can't afford to tip. It's a balance between their financial situation and the expectations of the service.\n\nIn some places, the delivery fee might cover part of the driver's pay, but in others, tips are a significant part. If the user is in the US, they should be aware of the tipping culture. However, if they're not used to it because of their country's norms, that's a factor. The answer might depend on whether the payment method allowed for a tip, and whether the user intentionally skipped it or just didn't know.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the user in the wrong? If they didn't leave a tip because they didn't know it was expected, maybe not. If they could have added a tip through the payment method but chose not to, then maybe they are. But since they mentioned they pay with card and didn't include a tip, perhaps they didn't know how or realized it's part of the process. The key is whether the delivery system allowed for a tip and the user's awareness of it. If the app doesn't have a tip option, not tipping is understandable. If it does, then not tipping could be seen as wrong. The user might not be in the wrong if they didn't know the local tipping norms or couldn't adjust their payment method accordingly. But since they are in the US, there's an expectation to tip, so maybe they are in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
