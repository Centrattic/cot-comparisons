AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.

It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. They usually make their own food but sometimes order takeout. The delivery fee makes the total high for a small order. They paid with a card and didn't tip. In their country, tipping is 10%, and they tip when paying cash. They feel the total is too much for ramen noodles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a financial situation where money is tight. The delivery fee is part of the cost, but they're questioning whether they should tip. In the US, tipping is customary, often around 15-20%, especially for services like delivery. However, the author comes from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're not used to higher tips. \n\nPaying with a card might make it easier to not tip since they don't handle cash. But the question is whether not tipping is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI should think about cultural expectations. In the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the total is high. However, the author's financial constraints are a factor. If they can't afford to tip, maybe it's understandable. But if they can afford the meal and the delivery fee, perhaps they should tip a small amount. \n\nThe key points are: the author's financial situation, cultural differences in tipping, and the payment method. Since the author is a student with limited funds, it's possible that they can't afford to tip, but if they can, even a small tip might be appreciated. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nIn some views, not tipping at all is wrong regardless of the reason. But others might empathize with financial hardship. The answer might depend on whether the author could manage a small tip. If the total is $19 for ramen, maybe the author could tip $1 or 2, but if that's too much, then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their situation is tough, and they might not be able to afford a tip. So the answer would be B.\n"
