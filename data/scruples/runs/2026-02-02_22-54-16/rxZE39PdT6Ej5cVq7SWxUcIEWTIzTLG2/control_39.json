      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they ordered food, and the total was $19 for ramen. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but they paid with a card and didn't leave a tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in the US, where tipping is a significant part of service workers' income. Even though in their home country it's 10%, in the US, the typical tip for delivery is often 15-20%, especially if it's a convenience store or restaurant delivery. However, the user is a student with tight finances, which is a common situation.\n\nThe key points here are financial constraints, cultural differences in tipping, and the method of payment. Since they used a card, they didn't have to handle cash, which might have made it easier to forget to tip. But in the US, even with card payments, people usually add a tip at checkout. Not leaving any tip, regardless of the payment method, might be seen as not following the local custom.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is that they find the total price (including delivery) already high, which could be a valid point. However, delivery workers rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be considered inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the user is struggling financially, it's a personal hardship. The question is whether the user is wrong for not tipping despite the financial situation.\n\nI think the answer would be that the user is not in the wrong (B) because they have a valid reason (limited funds) and maybe weren't aware of the US tipping culture. However, another perspective is that tipping is expected here, and not doing so is considered rude regardless of the reason. But given the user's explanation and being a student, maybe it's more of a B. Hmm, but some people might argue that the user should still tip even a small amount if possible. The total was $19, so 10% would be $1.90. Maybe they could have left that. But if they can't afford it, then it's understandable. So, maybe B is correct because the user's situation is a valid reason.\n"
