AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food infrequently, and finds the total cost including delivery and tip high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard, but when paying with card, they don't leave a tip automatically. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including delivery drivers. Even though the author is from a place where 10% is standard, they're now in the US where the expectation might be higher, especially for delivery. Delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income since their base pay is low. Not tipping could impact their earnings significantly.\n\nHowever, the author is a student with limited funds. They might not have the financial means to leave a tip, especially when the total cost is already high. The key point here is whether the author is obligated to tip regardless of their financial situation. In the US, while tipping is expected, some people might argue that if you can't afford a tip, you shouldn't order food, but others might understand financial constraints, especially for students.\n\nAlso, the author uses a card, which might not facilitate easy tipping, unlike cash. Some delivery apps have a tipping option built into the payment process, so maybe the author didn't consider adding a tip through the app. But if they're not aware of this, it's not entirely their fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have left a tip even if it's small. The question is whether 10% is considered appropriate in the US for delivery. Typically, in the US, 15-20% is common, but for delivery, sometimes people leave $2-5 regardless of the total. If the total was $19, 10% would be $1.90, which is reasonable. However, the author might not know this and is following their home country's standard.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they might be unaware of US tipping norms and are in a financial situation that limits their ability to tip. However, there's an argument that they should be aware of local customs, especially if they've been in the US for a while. But since they're a student, maybe they're still adjusting. The main point is that while tipping is expected, the author's situation and lack of awareness might mitigate their responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
