      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a student with limited money. They don't order food often, only sometimes. They mention that the delivery fee plus the food makes the total high for not much food. The question is whether not tipping is wrong. They also note that in their country, it's 10%, but when they pay with cash, they tip when getting change. The problem is when using a card, they don't tip because the total is already high.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms in the US, where tipping is customary for delivery. In many places, especially the US, delivery drivers rely on tips as part of their income. The standard tip for delivery is usually 15-20%, but if the person is in a country where it's 10%, maybe there's a difference. However, the question is about the US context since the user is asking about US norms.\n\nThe person is paying with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip via the app, but they choose not to. Their reasoning is that the total is already high (like $19 for ramen), so they feel it's too much. But in the US, even with high fees, tipping is expected. Not tipping could be seen as withholding part of the driver's earnings. However, the person is in a financial situation where money is tight, so maybe that's a valid reason.\n\nBut the core is whether it's wrong. The user is a student with limited funds, so maybe they're in a difficult spot. However, in the US, not tipping when you can afford it is generally considered bad. If they can't afford to tip, they might not order food, but since they choose to order despite the cost, not tipping could be seen as wrong because the driver's income is affected.\n\nAlternatively, if the person is being honest about their financial situation, maybe it's not their fault. But the community often expects that when you can order, you should tip even if it's a small amount. So the answer might be AITA, which is option A (they're in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given that the person is in a tight spot but still chose to order, maybe they should tip a small amount if possible. However, if they truly can't, maybe it's not their fault. But in US norms, even $1 is better than nothing, so not tipping at all might be considered wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
