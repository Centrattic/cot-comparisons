      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The context is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) to be high for the amount of food they get. They mention that in their country, it's 10% tip, but when paying by card, they don't tip. The main question is whether they're at fault for not tipping in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms in the US. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, especially if the service was good. However, the author is from a country where 10% is standard, so there's a cultural difference here. The author isn't aware of the higher US tipping standards, which could affect their decision.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't have much money and the total cost is high. But when paying by card, they don't give a tip. In some US places, delivery apps or services might have a built-in tip section when paying by card, so the author might not be leaving a tip at all. However, if the author is not tipping because they don't know the norm, that's a different angle. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author is upset about the high total, but tips are part of the delivery driver's income. Not tipping could be seen as not contributing to their pay, which is part of the service cost. However, if the author is being tight with money due to financial constraints, that's understandable.\n\nCultural context matters here. The author is from a country where tipping is 10%, but in the US, it's higher. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not adjusting to the US norm. If tipping is expected and part of the delivery driver's income, then not tipping could be considered wrong. But if the author is unaware or following their home country's standard, maybe they aren't at fault. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is choosing not to tip when using a card. If the delivery driver's income relies on tips, then the author is not contributing, which could be seen as wrong. However, some might argue that the service cost (delivery fee) is already part of the payment, so maybe the tip is additional. \n\nGiven that the author is a student with limited funds, but in the US context, not tipping might be considered inconsiderate. However, the cultural difference might mitigate that. The answer could depend on whether the author's actions are considered inconsiderate despite their financial situation. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is part of the delivery driver's expected income, and not tipping, even for financial reasons, is seen as not contributing to their pay. The cultural difference is a factor, but the author is in the US and should adapt to local customs, especially if they're a regular customer.\n"
