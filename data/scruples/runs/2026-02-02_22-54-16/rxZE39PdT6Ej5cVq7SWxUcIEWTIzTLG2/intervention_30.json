      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They mention being a student with limited funds and paying 19 dollars for ramen, which includes a delivery fee. They also note that in their country, the tip is 10%, but they pay with a card and don't tip in the US.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping culture. In the US, tipping is customary, especially for service workers like delivery drivers. The standard is usually around 15-20%, though it can vary. Since the author is in the US, they should be aware of this expectation. However, they might not be familiar with it if they're from another country, as they mentioned.\n\nThe author is a student with limited money. That's a valid point; financial constraints can affect tipping decisions. But in the US, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is struggling. Some might argue that the delivery fee covers the driver's pay, but often that's not the case\u2014the fee is just for the service, and tips are separate compensation for the worker.\n\nThe author pays with a card. In the US, online tipping is often an option at checkout. If they didn't include a tip there, that's different from cash where you can adjust the amount. So maybe the author didn't know how to tip via card or didn't realize they needed to add it separately. That could be a factor.\n\nThe cost of the meal plus delivery is 19 dollars. A 15% tip would be about $2.85, which is a small amount. Given the author's financial situation, this might be a tough choice, but it's still a standard practice. However, since they're not from the US, they might not be aware of this norm.\n\nThere's also the argument that in some countries, service charges are included, so tipping isn't expected. The author might be following their home country's customs, which could lead to a lack of tipping. But when in the US, adapting to local customs is typically expected, even for newcomers.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is new to the US and not fully aware of tipping norms, that's understandable. They might not have realized that not tipping could be considered rude or unfair to the delivery person. In that case, it's more of a cultural misunderstanding rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: financial situation, cultural background, and the expectation in the US, there's a balance. Some might say the author is in the wrong for not tipping, others might consider their circumstances and say it's not their fault. The key points are the intent and awareness of local customs. If the author knew about US tipping norms and chose not to tip despite being able to afford it, then they might be in the wrong. But if they genuinely didn't know, then it's a learning situation.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author was aware of the US tipping culture. If they were aware and still chose not to tip, it's in the wrong. If they were unaware, maybe not. But since they mentioned paying with a card, which might have made tipping harder for them, that adds another layer. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if it's a cultural misunderstanding, or A (in the wrong) if they should have known better.\n"
