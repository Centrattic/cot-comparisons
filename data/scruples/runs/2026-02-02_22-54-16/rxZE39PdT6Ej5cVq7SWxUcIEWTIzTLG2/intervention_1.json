AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and feels the delivery fee is already high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which they're questioning because in their country, 10% is the norm. They paid $19 for ramen, which they find expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, but it's not a law. The author is from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're not used to US tipping practices. Also, they're a student with limited funds, so financial constraints are a factor. \n\nThe question is whether not tipping is wrong here. The answer could depend on the perspective. If the delivery fee is separate from the tip, then the author might not be obligated to tip, but in the US context, not tipping could be seen as rude. However, the author is justifying it by their own country's norms and financial situation. \n\nI should consider if the delivery fee covers the delivery person's pay or if it's just a fee for the service. If the delivery person's wage is based on the delivery fee, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the delivery person relies on tips for income, then not tipping could affect their earnings. \n\nAlso, the user mentions paying with a card, which doesn't allow for cash tips. Maybe the restaurant doesn't add a tip automatically, so the user didn't leave one. \n\nSo, the answer might balance between US tipping expectations and the user's personal circumstances. The user is not in the US, so they might not be aware of the cultural nuances. But in the US, leaving a tip is expected even for delivery. However, the user is a student with limited funds, so maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong, considering their financial situation and different cultural norms. But it's a gray area. The key points are the cultural difference and financial constraints. However, some might argue that in the US context, not tipping is wrong regardless, making the answer A. But given the author's explanation, B seems more appropriate.\n"
