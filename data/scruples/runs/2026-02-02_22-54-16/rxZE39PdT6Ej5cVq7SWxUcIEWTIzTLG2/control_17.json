AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the delivery guy is in the wrong. They're a student with limited money, paying $19 for ramen with a delivery fee. They mention in their country it's 10%, but they paid with a card. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery. Even if paying by card, people usually add a tip via the app or website. The author didn't tip, which might be considered rude here.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they can't afford it. They mention paying a lot for not much food. However, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The fee goes to the company, while the tip is for the driver. Even if the total seems high, the tip expectation is part of the service.\n\nAlso, the author might not know US tipping norms. In their country, cash tips are common, but in the US, card tips are standard. Not leaving any tip could be seen as not contributing to the driver's income, especially since the fee isn't part of their pay.\n\nSo, while the author has a valid point about financial constraints, the expectation in the US is to tip, regardless of payment method. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not tipping. But it's also a matter of cultural misunderstanding. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies responsibility. Since the norm is to tip, even with a card, the author is expected to follow that, hence answer A.\n"
