      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and feels the delivery fee and total cost are high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which is different from their country's 10% norm. They paid $19 for ramen, which they find absurd.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms in the US. In many US restaurants and services, tipping is customary, often 15-20%, especially for services like delivery. However, some places might include a tip automatically or have a system where delivery drivers earn a base pay plus tips. If the delivery fee is separate from the tip, then the driver might rely on tips for their income. \n\nThe author is a student with financial constraints. They might not be aware of the US tipping culture, since in their country it's 10%, which is lower. Paying with a card might make it easier to skip the tip because it's not cash. But in the US, even with card payments, it's expected to add a tip. Some apps or services have a tip option at checkout. If the author didn't include that, they might be considered in the wrong because the driver depends on those tips. \n\nOn the other hand, the cost seems high, and the author is struggling financially. However, the responsibility for tipping is on the customer. Even if the total is high, the tip is part of the service cost. So, while the situation is understandable, not tipping could be seen as wrong because it's part of the expected norm in the US. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip despite the expectation in the US, even if they're on a budget.\n"
