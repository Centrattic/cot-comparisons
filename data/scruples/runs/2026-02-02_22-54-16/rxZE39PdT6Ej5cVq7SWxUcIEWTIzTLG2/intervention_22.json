Sometimes though I would like to order food. The place I order from take a delivery fee and I end up paying a lot for not too much food. AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change. It's just absurd that I end up paying 19$ for my ramen noodles.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The person is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which is different from their usual practice when paying cash. They\u2019re in a country where 10% is standard, but maybe in the US, tipping expectations are different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In the US, tipping is common for service jobs, including delivery. Usually, people tip between 15-20%, but sometimes less depending on the situation. The user might be confused because their home country's standard is 10%, which is lower. So, there's a cultural difference here.\n\nThe person's argument is that they can't afford to tip because they're a student and the total cost is high. They pay with a card, which might make tipping less immediate compared to cash. However, the delivery fee and the cost of the food might already be high, but the tip is still expected as a separate part of the payment.\n\nOn one hand, the delivery person relies on tips as part of their income, especially in places where wages are low and tipping is customary. Not tipping could be seen as unfair to the worker. On the other hand, the person has financial constraints and might not know the local tipping norms since they're from a country where it's lower.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the US expects tipping, then not doing so might be considered rude or unfair. However, the person might not be aware of the local expectations. But since they're asking the question, they are now aware and might be making a conscious choice. Still, their financial situation is a mitigating factor. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the key points are: the cultural expectation in the US, the financial situation of the person, and their intent. They might not be in the wrong because they\u2019re from a different country with different norms and are a student with limited funds. However, if they're aware now and continue to not tip, that could be seen as willfully ignoring local customs. But in this specific case, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
