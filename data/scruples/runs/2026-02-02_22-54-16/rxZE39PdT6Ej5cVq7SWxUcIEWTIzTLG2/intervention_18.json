      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The scenario is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery fee) high for not much food. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they use a card, they don't tip.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether not tipping is wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider cultural norms. The user says in their country it's 10% with cash, but the question is about the US. In the US, tipping for delivery is common, usually around 15-20%, sometimes less if the order is expensive. But the author is a student with limited funds. If they can't afford the tip, maybe that's understandable. \n\nAlso, the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author is paying a high total because of delivery fees, which might be a point. But delivery workers rely on tips for a significant part of their income. Not tipping could impact them negatively. \n\nHowever, the author's financial situation is tight. Maybe they can't afford to tip, so it's not their fault. But others might argue that even a small tip is better than nothing. \n\nThe key factors here are intent, circumstances, and cultural expectations. If the author is unaware that in the US, tips are expected for delivery, maybe they're not at fault. But if they're aware and choosing not to tip despite being able to, then maybe they are. \n\nThe user says the author paid with a card. Some platforms allow adding tips digitally, so maybe the author didn't know how to tip when paying by card. If they didn't have the option, then not tipping isn't their fault. If they could tip but chose not to, then maybe they are at fault. \n\nThe author mentions that when paying cash, they tip with the change, which implies they do tip when possible. The issue is with card payments. If the platform doesn't make it easy to tip via card, that's a system problem. But if they just didn't want to, even if they could, then maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nI think in this case, the author isn't at fault because they are a student with limited funds and might not know the US tipping norms for card payments. The high total cost is also a factor. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
