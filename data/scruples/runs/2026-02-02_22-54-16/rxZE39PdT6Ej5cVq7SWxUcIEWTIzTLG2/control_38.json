      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. They're a student with limited money, ordering food occasionally. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which includes a delivery fee. In their country, 10% is standard, but they pay in card and didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, it's common to tip delivery drivers, usually 15-20%, especially for cash. But when paying by card, sometimes people add a tip through the app or at checkout. The author didn't do that. \n\nThe key points here: they're paying with a card, not cash. If the delivery app allows adding a tip via card, not doing so might be seen as not tipping. However, if the app doesn't have that option, maybe it's less expected. Also, the total cost being high might make the person feel it's unfair. But delivery drivers often rely on tips as part of their income. \n\nSo, the author's argument is that in their country, they give 10% when paying cash, but in the US, maybe they didn't know the norm. Since they paid by card, perhaps they didn't consider adding a tip through the payment method. If the app allowed, not tipping could be seen as wrong. If not, maybe not. But the situation doesn't specify if the app had a tip option. \n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is in the US context. If the app requires a tip, then not adding it is wrong. If it's optional and they chose not to, maybe it's their choice. However, delivery drivers in the US often depend on tips, so not tipping could be considered inconsiderate. The cost being high doesn't necessarily justify not tipping, as tips are separate from the service cost. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they had the means to tip (card payment) and didn't, despite the driver relying on tips. But if the app didn't allow it, maybe not. Since the scenario doesn't mention that, it's safer to assume they could have and thus are at fault.\n"
