      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that the student is on a tight budget, orders food occasionally, and feels like the total cost including delivery is too high. They mention that in their country, the usual tip is 10%, but when paying with card, they don't tip because they don't have change. The cost of the ramen was $19, which they find absurd.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping practices in the US. From what I know, in the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, often around 15-20%, not just 10%. The user is paying with a card, which might make it easier to add a tip, but they're not doing it because they're used to cash tips where they give the change. So maybe they're not aware that in the US, even when paying by card, you're expected to include a tip. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't afford to tip because the total is already high. However, tipping in the US is considered part of the service cost, so even if it's a student, the expectation is that they would add a tip regardless. The fact that they're paying by card might make it easier to add the tip digitally, but they're not doing it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a financial situation where they're being careful with money. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the user is asking from the perspective of US norms, where tipping is expected, even if it's not in their home country. So the answer would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) meaning they might be in the wrong because they're not following the local tipping customs, even if their reasoning is understandable.\n\nBut wait, the user is a student with limited funds. However, the expectation in the US is that you tip for delivery services. Even if the total is high, the tip is a separate part of the cost. So the author is in the wrong because they're not contributing to the delivery person's income as per local standards. So the answer would be A.\n"
