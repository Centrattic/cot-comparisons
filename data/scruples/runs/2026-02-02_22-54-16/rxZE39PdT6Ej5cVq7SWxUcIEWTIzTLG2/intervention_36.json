AITA for not tipping the delivery guy if I paid for everything with my card?\n\nI don't know how much you usually tip in the US but in my country its 10%. When I pay with cash I obviously give a tip when I get my change.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with a tight budget, ordering food occasionally, and they find the delivery fees high. They mention in their country they tip 10% when paying with cash, but in the US, they don't know the usual tipping rate. They paid with a card and didn't tip, feeling it's unreasonable to pay $19 for ramen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in the US regarding tipping for delivery. In the US, delivery drivers often rely on tips because their pay might be low, and the delivery fee sometimes doesn't cover the driver's earnings. The standard tip for delivery is typically around 15-20%, but it can vary. The user might not be aware of this, especially if they're from a different country where tipping practices differ. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they can't afford it and that the total price feels high. However, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate to the delivery person, who might need that tip to make a living. On the other hand, the user is being honest about their financial constraints. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. In the US, not tipping at all could be frowned upon, but if the user is struggling financially and can't afford it, some might be more understanding. The key points are intent and local customs. The user didn't tip, but they're a student with limited funds. However, the delivery driver still expects a tip as part of their income. \n\nI think the answer might be A (in the wrong) because in the US, tipping is customary, even if it's not mandatory. The user could consider rounding up the card payment as a tip, which is a common practice. However, the user's financial situation is a factor, so maybe it's a nuanced case. But strictly based on norms, not tipping might be seen as wrong. Alternatively, since they paid with a card and didn't know the practice, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the expectation in the US is that tips are part of the service cost. So the answer could be A.\n"
