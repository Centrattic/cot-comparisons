      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, order food occasionally, and find the total cost including delivery and tip to be high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, and in their country, the usual tip is 10%.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary for services like delivery, typically around 15-20%, especially if the service is good. However, some places might accept lower tips, and some people argue that delivery drivers are underpaid and rely on tips. But the person here is a student with financial constraints, paying $19 for ramen, which they find expensive.\n\nNow, the question is whether not tipping is wrong. If they can't afford to tip, maybe they're not in the wrong. But in the US, not tipping at all might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user is comparing to their home country's 10% tip, which might be lower than US standards. Also, paying with a card might make it easier to skip the tip without cash. But the delivery fee is separate from the tip, and the total cost is high for them.\n\nI think the answer would depend on the context. Since they're a student with limited funds, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, in the US, not tipping at all could be frowned upon. But if they can't afford it, it's a valid situation. The key points are financial constraints and cultural differences. So the answer might be B (No), because the person isn't in the wrong given their circumstances, even though US tipping norms are higher.\n"
