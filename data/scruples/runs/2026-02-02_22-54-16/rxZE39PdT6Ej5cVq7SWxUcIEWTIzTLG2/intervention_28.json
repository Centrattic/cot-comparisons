      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about not tipping the delivery guy is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the delivery fees high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which they're wondering if it's acceptable. They also note that in their country, the tipping rate is 10%, but when paying cash, they tip with change. Now they're using a card and not tipping because of the high cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user mentions their country's 10% tipping, but the question is about the US. In the US, tipping is customary even when paying by card. However, some people argue that delivery workers, especially, rely on tips since their pay might be lower. But others might say that if the total cost is already high (like $19 for ramen), then not tipping could be understandable, especially for a student.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't have much money, and the delivery fees plus the food cost a lot. They're not in the habit of tipping with a card. However, the standard expectation in the US is that tips are part of the transaction, even with cards. But since they're a student and it's a rare order, maybe it's a gray area. Also, the delivery fee is separate from the tip, so the author might not realize that the delivery fee doesn't include a service charge. \n\nI think the key points are the cultural expectation vs. personal financial situation. In the US, not tipping could be seen as wrong because it's expected. But the author's situation is that they can't afford it. It's a bit of a conflict between expectations and personal circumstances. However, the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the norm is to tip, then technically they are in the wrong. But if they explain their situation, maybe it's more of a minor oversight. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. I think the answer depends on strict adherence to US tipping norms. Since the author didn't tip at all, even though they paid with a card, which typically allows for adding a tip, that could be seen as wrong. However, the author is a student and the cost was high. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because their intention wasn't malicious, just financial constraints. But in the US, the expectation is to tip, so maybe A. Hmm. \n\nI think the community might lean towards B because of the financial situation, but strictly speaking, US norms would say A. But the author is not from the US, so maybe they're unaware. The answer might be B. I'm a bit torn, but since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author didn't have malicious intent, perhaps B is better.\n"
