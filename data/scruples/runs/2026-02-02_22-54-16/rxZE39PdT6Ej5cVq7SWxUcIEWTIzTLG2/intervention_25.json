      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, ordering food occasionally. They mention that in their country, the tip is 10%, but in the US, they're confused about the usual tipping amount. They paid with a card and ended up paying a delivery fee, making the total $19 for ramen. The question is whether they're at fault for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider US tipping norms. Typically, in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for services like delivery. However, the situation here is that the author is in a different country but now in the US. They might be following the 10% from their home country. But since they're in the US, the expectation might be higher. However, they paid with a card, which doesn't allow for tipping at the time of payment unless they add it through the app or website. Maybe they didn't know they had to add the tip separately when using a card. \n\nThe author is a student with limited funds, so maybe they're not in a position to tip as much as the standard. But is it their responsibility to know the US tipping norms? Also, some delivery services allow you to set the tip when you place the order, so perhaps the author didn't realize they needed to do that. \n\nAnother angle: the delivery fee is separate from the tip. The author is upset about the delivery fee making the total high, but the tip is part of the delivery person's income. Not tipping could affect their earnings. However, the author's financial constraints might be a factor. Is it fair to expect them to tip despite their limited income? \n\nIn some places, tips are expected regardless of payment method. If the author paid with cash, they would tip when giving change, which they do in their country. But in card payments, maybe they didn't know how to add a tip. So maybe the author was just unaware of the process. \n\nAlso, the cost of $19 for ramen seems high due to delivery fees and possible other charges. The author might be frustrated with the total cost, leading them to skip the tip. But should the delivery person's wage be part of their responsibility to cover, even if they're stressed about money? \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention wasn't to be disrespectful but rather due to financial constraints and possibly lack of knowledge about US tipping practices. They might not be in the wrong, especially if they were unaware of the process for tipping via card. However, if they had the means and just chose not to tip, that's different. Since they're a student with limited money, it's a bit of a gray area. But in the US, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. But given their situation, maybe it's understandable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
