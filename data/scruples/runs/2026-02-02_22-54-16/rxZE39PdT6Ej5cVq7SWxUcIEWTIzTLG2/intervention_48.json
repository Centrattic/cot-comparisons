      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The author is a student with limited money, orders food occasionally, and finds the total cost (including delivery) high. They mention paying with a card and not tipping, which is different from their usual practice when paying cash. They wonder if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US. Tipping is customary there, even though it's not mandatory. For delivery, people often tip around 15-20%, but it can vary. The author is coming from a country where 10% is standard, so maybe they're not used to the higher US tipping norms. However, the question is about US context since they're asking about US practices.\n\nThe author is a student with limited funds. They mention paying $19 for ramen, which seems expensive. They might be under financial stress, so not tipping could be a way to save money. But the delivery fee is separate from the tip. Even if the total is high, not tipping might be seen as inconsiderate in the US. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the service was poor or if the situation is different from usual (like paying with a card instead of cash where tipping is automatic), then it's understandable. The author didn't specify if the delivery was timely or if there was any issue with the service. If everything was fine, not tipping could be seen as wrong. But if the cost is already high, maybe they're justified in not tipping, especially as a student.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, tipping is expected in the US for good service. On the other hand, the high cost and financial constraints might make the author's decision understandable. The answer could depend on whether the service was up to standard. Since the scenario doesn't mention any problems with the delivery, the default assumption might be that tipping is expected. However, the user is in a financial bind, which adds context. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the context of financial hardship and the high cost could mitigate the expectation of tipping. Also, the user is from a country with different tipping norms, which might influence their perspective. But others might argue that regardless of background, US norms should be followed. It's a bit tricky. I'm leaning towards B because of the financial situation and the cultural differences, but I can see arguments for A as well.\n"
