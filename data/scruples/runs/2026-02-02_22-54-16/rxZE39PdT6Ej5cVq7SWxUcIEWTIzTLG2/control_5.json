      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the delivery guy. The context is that the person is a student with limited money, pays by card, and feels that the total cost including delivery is too high. They mention that in their country, a 10% tip is standard when paying cash, but since they use a card, they don't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the usual tipping norms in the US. In the US, it's customary to tip around 15-20% for services like delivery, especially when paying by card. However, delivery drivers might not always receive the tip immediately if it's added to the card payment. Wait, actually, when you pay by card, the tip is usually optional and added at the time of payment. So if you pay by card, you can choose to add a tip, but if you don't, the driver might not get it. \n\nThe author is not tipping because they're using a card and perhaps not aware of how to add a tip through that method. They also feel that the total cost is too high, which might be because delivery fees and taxes are included. The author might not know that in the US, tips are expected even more so when using a card because cash tips aren't an option. \n\nSo the question is whether not tipping is wrong here. The key points are: the person is a student with limited funds, but the norm in the US is to tip delivery drivers. The author's reasoning is based on their country's practice and their payment method. However, in the US, even with card payments, a tip is expected unless the total includes a service fee (which sometimes covers the tip). The author might be in the right if the delivery fee doesn't include a tip, but the expectation is still for a separate tip. Alternatively, if the delivery service automatically adds a tip when paying by card, then not adding one would be inconsiderate. However, the author might not be aware of this. \n\nSince the author is in the US, the standard would be to tip. Not tipping could be seen as wrong because the delivery driver relies on tips as part of their income. The author's financial situation is a factor, but the social norm is still in place. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But the answer depends on whether the tip is expected to be added when using a card. If the author didn't know that, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong regardless of their knowledge. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged based on what is socially acceptable, not just their intent. So if the norm is to tip, then not doing so, even unintentionally, might make them AITA. However, if they are a student with limited money and paying by card (which doesn't allow cash tips), maybe they are not in the wrong because they can't add a tip. Wait, but when you pay by card, you can still choose to add a tip. So if they're not doing that, even if they can't give cash, they are still not tipping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they can choose to add a tip when using a card. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
