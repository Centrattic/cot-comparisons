      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping a delivery guy. The user is a student with limited money, and they paid by card, not cash. They mention that in their country, it's 10% tip, but they didn't tip here. They paid $19 for ramen, which includes delivery fees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a student, so their financial situation is tight. They don't order food often because they make it themselves. When they do, it's expensive due to delivery fees. In their country, tipping is 10%, and they tip when paying cash. But here, they used a card and didn't tip. \n\nIn the US, tipping is customary, even though it's not mandatory. The expectation is usually around 15-20%, but some people might tip less if the service is poor. The question is whether not tipping at all is wrong in this scenario. The user might not have done it intentionally but because they were used to cash tips and didn't know how it works with card payments. \n\nAlso, since they paid with a card, maybe the delivery guy didn't get the cash amount immediately, but the user might not have had change to give a tip. However, in the US, when paying by card, you can still add a tip electronically. So the user had the option to tip via card but chose not to. \n\nSo, the user's argument is that they didn't tip because they paid with a card and didn't give a tip, maybe not knowing they could add a tip through the payment method. But the counterpoint is that tipping is expected regardless of payment method. \n\nThe user is in a financial bind, but the question is whether they're wrong. If they didn't tip because they were unaware of the norm or the method, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But if they knew and chose not to, then they are in the wrong. \n\nThe user mentions they tip when paying cash, so maybe they just didn't think to add a tip when using a card. In that case, it's a mistake rather than intentional. But the delivery guy still expects a tip as part of their income. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the user is expected to know to tip even when using a card. Since they are in the US and the context is about US tipping norms, the expectation is there. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not tipping, even if it was a mistake. But the situation is understandable given their financial constraints and possible lack of knowledge. \n\nBut AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions often consider intention and context. If the user is a student with a tight budget and only ordered once, maybe the community would be lenient. However, the act of not tipping is still against the norm, so the answer could be A. But maybe B because of their circumstances. Hmm.\n"
