      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping a delivery guy. The situation is that they're a student with limited money, they order food occasionally, and they find the total cost (including delivery fee) unreasonable. They mention that in their country, tipping is 10%, but they pay with a card and didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms in the US versus other countries. Tipping in the US is a big part of service workers' income, often expected to be around 15-20%, especially for delivery. However, the author is from a country where 10% is standard. They might not be aware of US tipping practices, which could affect their decision not to tip.\n\nNext, the cost of the meal. The total came to $19 for ramen noodles. Delivery fees can be high, so maybe that's why it's expensive. But the author might feel that the price already includes the delivery, making the tip an extra burden. However, in the US, delivery fees and tips are separate; tips are part of the delivery driver's earnings.\n\nThe author is using a card, which might make it easier to not tip since cash tipping is more common. But that's a practical issue rather than a moral one. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping despite the cost. \n\nConsidering that in the US, not tipping is seen as inconsiderate and can hurt the delivery person's income, especially if the author is aware of the US standard. However, the author might not be aware of these nuances. If the author is a student with limited funds and the total is high, it's understandable they might hesitate, but the expectation in the US is still to tip. \n\nSo, there's a conflict between cultural expectations and personal financial constraints. The author isn't malicious, but not tipping could be seen as wrong in the US context. However, if they were unaware of the local customs, maybe that's a factor. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong if they weren't aware, but if they were aware and still chose not to tip, it could be different. The post doesn't mention prior awareness, so maybe they are not in the wrong.\n"
