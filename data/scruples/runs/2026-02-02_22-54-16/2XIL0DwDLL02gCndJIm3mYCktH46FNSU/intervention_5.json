I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one. The situation is that the sister's new boyfriend is unpopular with the family, and the author decided to remove his invitation, causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The wedding is a personal event, and the author wants it to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister had a plus one before, but now the new boyfriend is causing issues. The author found a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included. \n\nThe key points are: the author is standing by their decision to maintain the wedding's vibe, they found a substitute, but the sister is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nI think the author has a right to set the tone for their event. It's their day, and they can choose who attends. However, the sister's reaction might be extreme, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for enforcing their preferences. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative, mooching) seems to be valid concerns for the family. The author acted to preserve the event's atmosphere, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, rescinding a plus one last-minute could be seen as harsh, but the author provided a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister's threat to not attend is her choice, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort. \n\nSo, I lean towards answer B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
