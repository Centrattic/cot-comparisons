I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the brother is in the wrong for rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The brother organized a destination wedding with close family and friends, aiming for an intimate setting. He gave the sister a plus one originally because she had a previous boyfriend they liked. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is unemployed, talks non-stop, and the family isn't fond of him. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to fill in, and now the sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nOn one hand, the brother has the right to choose who attends his wedding, especially since it's a destination event with potentially high costs. He wants everyone there to be someone he can enjoy, which is reasonable. The sister's boyfriend has only been in the relationship for six months, which isn't an extremely long time, but the sister is making a stand by threatening not to come. \n\nOn the other hand, rescinding the plus one last minute might be seen as unfair, especially if the sister had plans to bring someone. However, the brother did manage to adjust by inviting a cousin instead, so there's no financial loss. The sister's reaction is extreme; walking out on a sibling's wedding over a plus one might be disproportionate. \n\nThe key points are the brother's right to his guest list, the sister's insistence on her boyfriend despite his negative traits, and the potential impact on the wedding. The brother's main concern is maintaining a pleasant environment, which is valid. The sister's threat seems to be more about asserting her right to bring someone rather than the boyfriend himself. \n\nConsidering all this, the brother isn't in the wrong. He communicated his decision and found a solution to avoid financial loss. The sister's response is more about control than the actual issue. So, the answer should be B.\n"
