I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend due to disliking him. The author is getting married and they don't want this guy there because they don't like his behavior. The sister is upset and might not come if he's not included.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The wedding is a destination event, so there's probably a lot of costs involved. They gave the sister a plus one initially because she had an old boyfriend, and after the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now the new guy is a problem. The author is trying to keep it intimate with close friends and family. The sister has been dating him for six months and feels he should come. The author found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they want the wedding to be enjoyable for everyone there. The boyfriend's behavior is described as talkative, unemployed, mooching, etc., which makes the author uncomfortable. The sister is threatening to boycott the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host has the right to set the guest list. However, excluding someone because of personal dislike can be seen as harsh, especially if the person is a partner to a family member. But the sister was given a plus one, not the boyfriend. The author is the one who initially allocated the plus one, so maybe they have the right to rescind it if the circumstances change. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe she's being unreasonable by threatening to not come. The author tried to mitigate the financial impact by finding a replacement, which shows consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's partner is part of her life now, and excluding him might feel like a personal attack. The duration of the relationship is only six months, but that's not insignificant. The author's reasons are based on the boyfriend's behavior, which is a valid concern for the event's atmosphere.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to control their guest list, especially for an intimate event. They made a decision based on the group's comfort. The sister's threat might be overreacting. So answer B.\n"
