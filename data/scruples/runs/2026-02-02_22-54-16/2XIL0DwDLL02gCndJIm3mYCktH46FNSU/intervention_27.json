I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the brother, 27M, and his sister is 24F. They had given her a plus one before because they liked her ex, but now her new boyfriend is problematic. The boyfriend is unemployed, 31, and very talkative, making others uncomfortable. The author decided to remove the plus one and found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to skip the wedding if he's not allowed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants the wedding to be intimate with only close family and friends. The sister has been with the boyfriend for 6 months. On one hand, the brother is the one hosting the wedding, so he does have some authority over the guest list. On the other hand, cutting off the plus one might be seen as harsh, especially if the sister feels it's a personal rejection. The boyfriend's traits are mentioned as mooching and being overbearing, which might be valid concerns for an intimate event. But the sister's reaction is to leave the wedding, which could be a big deal. \n\nI need to think about the norms around wedding guest lists. Typically, weddings are the couple's event, so they can set the guest list. However, family dynamics play a role here. The sister is a key part of the family, and not allowing her to bring someone might be seen as cutting her off. But if the boyfriend is a negative influence or disruptive, maybe the brother is justified. \n\nAlso, the timing is last minute, which could add stress. The fact that they found a replacement (the cousin) to avoid losing money shows they tried to be considerate. The sister's threat to not come is a strong response. It might depend on the relationship between the brother and sister. If rescinding the plus one is causing her to skip the wedding, the brother might be losing a close family member, which is a downside. \n\nBut the original question is whether the brother is in the wrong. The main issue is his right to exclude someone from his wedding. Since it's his wedding, he can choose who to invite. However, if excluding the boyfriend is a way to control or reject his sister's choice, that might be problematic. The boyfriend's behavior is a factor here. The sister might feel that her partner should be included, even if the family doesn't like him. \n\nI think the brother is not in the wrong because it's his right to have a guest list that he's comfortable with, especially for an intimate event. But it's a bit of a gray area because family relationships can be complex. The sister's threat is a separate issue, but the brother's decision isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
