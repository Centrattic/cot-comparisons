I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister originally had a plus one because her ex-boyfriend was someone the family liked. After the breakup, the sister found a new partner that the family doesn't approve of. The author is the one making the decision to remove this new boyfriend's invitation. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend can't come. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me see why. Weddings are personal events, and it's common to have a guest list of close friends and family. The author's main concern is maintaining an intimate setting. The boyfriend is unemployed, described as a moocher, and very talkative, which might make the family uncomfortable. However, the sister's reaction is to not attend, which could cause more issues. \n\nBut here's the thing: the plus one was given to the sister, not the boyfriend. The author is changing the invitation terms after the fact, which could be seen as being unfair. The sister might feel that if she's allowed to bring someone, it's her right to choose who that person is, especially since they've only been dating six months. The author's decision could be perceived as meddling in her personal life. \n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is the author's event, and they might have a right to set the tone. The plus one might have been a courtesy, and if the new partner is a problem, it's reasonable to adjust. But rescinding it so close to the event and causing the sister to potentially miss the wedding might be harsh. \n\nI need to consider if the author acted unreasonably. They tried to mitigate costs by getting a cousin to cover, which is thoughtful. But the sister's threat to leave is a significant consequence. The author's reasoning is about personal enjoyment and the wedding's intimacy. However, the sister's autonomy in choosing her plus one is also a factor. \n\nIn many cases, family members might have some say over their own guests, especially if it's a plus one. So the author might be overstepping by unilaterally deciding who can attend with their sister. It's possible the author is in the wrong because it's not their place to exclude someone else's partner, even if they disagree with the relationship. The sister's choice to bring her partner could be her right, and the author's decision could be seen as being disrespectful to her. \n\nAlternatively, if the plus one was a privilege given by the author, they might have the right to revoke it. But since the sister is a close family member, this could be a breach of trust. The line here is blurry, but the key point is whether the author crossed a boundary by removing the invitation without considering the sister's feelings and their bond. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author might be in the wrong. They should have had a conversation with the sister earlier, perhaps trying to understand the situation more or setting boundaries before the event. Rescinding the plus one so close to the wedding and causing a rift could be seen as selfish, even if the intention was to keep the wedding intimate. The sister's relationship and her choice to bring her partner might be within her rights, and the author's action could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy.\n"
