I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at the wedding because they don't like the new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The wedding is a destination event, so there's likely some cost involved. The sister had a previous boyfriend they liked, but now with the new one, the family is unhappy. The boyfriend is unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author decided to remove the plus one, found a replacement (their cousin), to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening not to attend if he's not included.\n\nWeddings are personal and people have the right to choose their guests. If the author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family, they might feel uncomfortable including someone they don't like. However, removing a plus one for someone who's part of the immediate family could be seen as harsh. The sister might feel that the boyfriend is important to her, and if they've only been dating six months, maybe it's not too recent. But the author is trying to protect their own experience on their wedding day.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries for their event. On the other hand, excluding someone so close to the sister might cause family conflict. But the author did offer a replacement, so maybe they're trying to be fair. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening not to attend could be an overreaction, but it shows how important the boyfriend is to her.\n\nI think the key points are the right to choose wedding guests and the potential for family tension. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to ensure their event is comfortable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be sure.\n"
