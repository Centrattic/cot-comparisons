I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not included.\n\nFirst, weddings are personal events. The author wants it to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister's ex-boyfriend was liked, but the new one is 31 and unemployed, described as a mooch and a talkative person. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to enjoy the wedding if her new partner is there. They also found a replacement (the cousin) to avoid losing money. \n\nThe key points here are the right to set boundaries for the wedding, the last-minute change, and the potential consequence of the sister not attending. The author might have a right to choose who attends their own wedding, especially if it's meant to be small. However, excluding someone close to the sister could hurt her and affect the wedding dynamics. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's decision might be justified if they're concerned about the guest's behavior and the event's atmosphere. \n\nBut there's a nuance. If the sister is being excluded because of her new partner, not the sister herself, maybe they should have discussed it with her first. However, the author might feel that their own comfort is important. It's a family conflict, and both sides have some responsibilities. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they could have handled it more sensitively. The answer likely leans towards B (No), but it's a bit of a tight call.\n"
