I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is getting married and originally gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now the sister has a new boyfriend, and the author doesn't like him. They rescinded the plus one and found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid extra costs. The sister is now threatening to not attend the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The wedding is intimate, with close friends and family. The author's reasoning is that they want to enjoy everyone present, so they don't want this boyfriend there. The sister has been given a plus one before, but now the new partner is problematic. The boyfriend is unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author made the decision last minute but adjusted with a cousin to avoid financial loss.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The author is the one hosting the wedding, so they have the final say on guests, right? But the sister is threatening not to come, which could be a problem. Is it fair for the author to exclude the boyfriend based on personal dislike? Well, the author mentions that the boyfriend is a burden on the sister and dominates conversations. That's a valid concern for the event's atmosphere.\n\nBut is it the author's place to decide who the sister brings, especially if the sister is attending? The plus one was originally given as a courtesy, but the author can change their mind if something changes. The sister's new partner's behavior could affect the wedding. On the other hand, the sister might feel disrespected if her current partner is excluded, even if the author liked her previous partner.\n\nAlso, the timeline is last minute, which adds stress. The author tried to mitigate costs by finding a cousin, so they're not making the sister pay for it. The sister's threat to not attend is a consequence, but maybe the author is within their rights to prioritize their own comfort and the event's vibe.\n\nSo, in AITA terms, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set their guest list, especially for an intimate wedding. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern, and the author is trying to maintain the event's quality. The sister's reaction is her choice, but the author isn't wrong for making a decision they feel is necessary for their special day."
