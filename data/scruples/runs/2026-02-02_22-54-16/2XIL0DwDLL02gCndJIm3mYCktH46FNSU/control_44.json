I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old man, is getting married and decided to rescind his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author found a replacement so no money is lost, but the sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't invited. They've been dating for six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around wedding guest lists. Typically, guests are your close family and friends. The author gave the sister a plus one, which is common, but now the new boyfriend is a problem. The sister's previous boyfriend was liked, but the new one isn't. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want someone who's disliked at the wedding, especially since it's intimate. But the sister is upset and says she won't attend without her plus one.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal, and the hosts usually have the final say on the guest list. However, cutting a relative's plus one close to the event could be seen as harsh. The sister is being punished for her choice of partner. Also, the boyfriend's issues (unemployment, mooching, talkative) are subjective. What if the sister's choice of partner isn't the problem but the author's disapproval? Also, the sister's reaction is to leave the wedding, which is a big deal. \n\nBut the author did make a replacement to avoid financial loss, which shows consideration. However, the decision was made after the initial invites, which might be last-minute. The sister's threat is a consequence the author might not have anticipated. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is balancing personal boundaries and family dynamics. The author's main point is wanting an intimate wedding with people they like. The sister might feel her autonomy is being infringed if her partner isn't allowed. However, the author isn't excluding her; just her plus one. But if excluding her date makes her not come, that's a significant impact. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the wedding is their event. On the other hand, the sister is a close family member. The author might not be in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of rescinding the plus one abruptly. The answer depends on whether the author overstepped by making the decision without discussing it with the sister. Since the sister's attendance is now at risk, maybe the author should have considered that. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if they handled it poorly. So the answer might be B (No), because the author has the right to choose their wedding guests, even if it causes family tension. However, some might argue it's inconsiderate. The AITA community often sides with the person making the choice if they have a reason, even if it's personal. So probably B."
