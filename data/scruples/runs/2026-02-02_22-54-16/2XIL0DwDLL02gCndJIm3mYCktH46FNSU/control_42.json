I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The user is a 27-year-old guy who is getting married and has decided to rescind his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if he's excluded. The author believes that the wedding should be an intimate gathering with people they actually enjoy.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The sister was given a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him there because they can't stand him. They managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and might not come if he's not allowed.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they want their wedding to be with people they actually enjoy, especially since it's supposed to be intimate. The sister's boyfriend doesn't fit that. But the sister feels she should be able to bring him since they've only been dating six months. Is the author wrong to do this?\n\nHmm. Weddings can be personal, and the couple usually has the final say on the guest list. So if the author and his fianc\u00e9e dislike the boyfriend, they might have the right to exclude him. However, the sister is threatening not to attend, which complicates things. Family dynamics can be tricky here. The sister might feel her autonomy is being questioned, especially if she's an adult. But the wedding is the author's event, so maybe he has a right to set the guest list.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this with his sister earlier. If the plus one was rescinded last minute, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The sister might have already made plans to bring her boyfriend, and the sudden change could hurt her feelings. But the author claims they had to wait until later because the relationship was recent. They also found a replacement to avoid financial issues.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's behavior. If the author and his fianc\u00e9e genuinely can't stand him, it's reasonable to not want him there, especially for an intimate event. The author's reasoning about wanting to enjoy the company of guests makes sense. But the sister's reaction is also valid\u2014she might feel that her relationship is being dismissed after only six months.\n\nI think the key here is that the wedding is the author's and his fianc\u00e9e's event. They have the final say over the guest list. The sister is an adult, but her attendance isn't guaranteed if her presence with the boyfriend would ruin the event. However, the sister's threat to leave the wedding adds emotional weight. Maybe the author should consider finding a middle ground, like meeting with the boyfriend to see if issues can be resolved, but the author might not want to do that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong because the guest list is their decision. The sister's reaction is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to include someone their family dislikes. The boyfriend's behavior and the author's desire for an enjoyable event support the author's decision. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
