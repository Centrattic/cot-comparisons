I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is getting married and had given their sister a plus one. The sister's new boyfriend is causing issues because he's unemployed, mooching off her, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute. The sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't included. The author wants to keep the wedding intimate with close friends and family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the guidelines for weddings. Typically, the wedding couple can set the guest list as they see fit. It's their event, so they have the right to decide who attends. However, there's a family aspect here with the sister. Maybe the sister feels that the boyfriend is important to her, especially since they've only been dating six months, and she's considering him part of her support system. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the boyfriend is not liked by the family and the wedding is supposed to be intimate. The author even found a replacement for the plus one to avoid financial loss, which shows they tried to handle it respectfully. The sister is now threatening to not come, which is a big deal because weddings are about family. However, if the author is uncomfortable having the boyfriend there and it's affecting the atmosphere, maybe it's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, rescinding a plus one last minute might be seen as inconsiderate. The sister might have made plans with her boyfriend to attend, and changing that at the last minute could cause her to feel disrespected. But the author's intention was to maintain the wedding's vibe, which is understandable. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's right to control the guest list, the replacement to avoid costs, and the sister's potential overreaction. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's their event. However, maybe there's a middle ground, but the sister's threat is her own choice. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
