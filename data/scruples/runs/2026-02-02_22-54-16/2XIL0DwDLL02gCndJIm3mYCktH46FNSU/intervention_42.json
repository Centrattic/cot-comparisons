I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a guy who's getting married and has rescinded his sister's plus one because he doesn't like her new boyfriend. The sister is upset and might not come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for hosts to decide the guest list. The original plus one was given because they liked her ex, but since the relationship ended, the user waited before deciding. Now, with the new boyfriend, they have issues: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The user wants to maintain an intimate setting with close friends and family, which is understandable. They even found a cousin to take the spot to avoid financial loss, so they're trying to be fair.\n\nThe sister is threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't there. That's a problem because the user is the one hosting, and it's their day. But the sister's reaction could be because she feels her partner is important to her. However, the user isn't excluding the sister herself; just the plus one. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? On one hand, he's entitled to his guest list. On the other, maybe the sister feels disrespected. But the user tried to find a compromise by replacing the plus one with a family member. The boyfriend's behavior might also be a valid concern for the user's comfort. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. The key points are the right to control the guest list, the boyfriend's problematic traits, and the effort to find a solution. The sister's threat is more about her reaction than the user's initial decision. So answer B.\n"
