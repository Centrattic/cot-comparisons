I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer rescinding their sister's plus one for the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer is a guy getting married, and he gave his sister a plus one initially because she had a previous boyfriend they liked. When they broke up, they waited to see who the new partner would be. The sister now has a new boyfriend that the writer and possibly other family members dislike. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The writer decided to rescind the plus one to avoid having someone they don't like at the wedding, which is supposed to be an intimate event. They found a cousin to take the place to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and he has the right to set the guest list as he sees fit, especially since it's an intimate wedding. He's not excluding the sister herself but just her partner. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her choice of partner is being judged, and the threat to not attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed is a significant consequence. However, the author isn't forcing the sister to exclude her boyfriend; he's just removing the plus one. The sister is now using that as leverage to not attend, which complicates things.\n\nIn many cases, wedding guest lists are a personal choice, and the host can decide who attends. The boyfriend's behavior and employment status are personal matters, but the author's discomfort with him is valid. However, the sister's reaction might be an overreaction, using the plus one as a way to exert control. The author's solution of replacing the plus one with a cousin is a practical step to avoid financial waste, which shows consideration. \n\nBut, there's a risk that the sister's threat is real, and excluding her partner might cause her not to attend, which the author might not want. However, if the sister truly values her brother's wedding, she might attend without the boyfriend. The author isn't being malicious; he's standing by his decision to keep the event intimate. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
