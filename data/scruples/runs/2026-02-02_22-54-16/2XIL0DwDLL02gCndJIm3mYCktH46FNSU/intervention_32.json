I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for a sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him. The author is getting married and wants the wedding to be intimate with only close family and friends. They gave the sister a plus one before, but after a breakup, the new boyfriend is an issue. The sister is threatening not to come if he isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider wedding etiquette. Usually, guests list includes close family's plus ones. But it's a destination wedding, which is more expensive. The author might be concerned about the number of people and the vibe. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch, and is very talkative. The author has already replaced him with a cousin to avoid costs.\n\nThe sister is upset, but they've only been dating six months. The author is standing by their decision because they want everyone at the wedding to be enjoyable. The sister's threat to not come is a possible consequence. \n\nIs it fair for the author to exclude the boyfriend? Well, the author's wedding is a personal event. They might have the right to set boundaries for their own event. However, excluding a plus one could strain family relationships. But considering the sister's new partner's behavior and the fact that they're paying for a destination wedding, maybe the author is justified. The sister should have considered this when choosing to bring someone. The author isn't being cruel; they're trying to maintain the event's integrity. So, the answer is B.\n"
