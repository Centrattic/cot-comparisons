I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is a destination event, so probably expensive. The sister was given a plus one because her ex-boyfriend was previously liked, but now she's with someone new who the family doesn't get along with. The author doesn't want this new boyfriend there since they don't get along and he's unemployed, talks too much, etc.\n\nThe key points here: the author is the one getting married, so they have the right to decide the guest list. The sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't included. The author found a replacement, so no financial loss. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's an intimate wedding with close friends and family. They might feel that the new boyfriend doesn't fit that vibe. However, the sister is hurt because the boyfriend is part of her life now. \n\nBut the author isn't excluding the sister, just the boyfriend. The sister is being asked to attend without a plus one. The fact that the author found a substitute (their cousin) suggests they tried to accommodate the sister's attendance. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person's right to their own preferences is usually respected, especially for personal events like weddings. The sister's reaction might be extreme, but the author isn't wrong for not wanting someone they don't like at their own wedding. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance if the sister wasn't consulted beforehand. But the post says they decided to wait and see who she was bringing, so maybe they didn't commit to the plus one in advance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice about their guest list. The sister's threat is more about her own feelings, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they don't want there. Answer B.\n"
