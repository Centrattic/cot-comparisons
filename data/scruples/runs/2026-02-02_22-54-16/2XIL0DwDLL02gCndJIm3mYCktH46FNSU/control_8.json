I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the author rescinded a plus one for their sister due to disliking her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author originally gave their sister a plus one when she was with her ex, who they liked. After the breakup, the sister started dating someone new. The author and their family don't like this new boyfriend because he's unemployed, mooches off the sister, and is very talkative. The author then rescinds the plus one, finds a cousin to take the spot to avoid financial loss, but the sister is threatening to not attend the wedding if he can't come.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key factors here are the dynamics of the wedding guest list, family relationships, and the reasons for excluding the boyfriend.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they dislike there. The boyfriend is only been with the sister for six months, which might be a consideration\u2014should someone in a new relationship be included if it's a problem for the host?\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset because she feels the boyfriend should be allowed. The author's action might be seen as overstepping, especially if the sister is an invited guest. However, the author did replace the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior and unemployment are the reasons cited. But is it fair to judge someone based on those factors? The author may have their own preferences about who attends their wedding, but family dynamics can complicate things. The sister's reaction is to threaten not attending, which adds pressure.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the fairness of the actions and the potential consequences. The author's action is firm but done to maintain the wedding's intimacy. However, excluding someone based on personal dislike (even if justified by their behavior) can be seen as harsh. The sister's reaction might be extreme, but the author's decision could be seen as reasonable if they prioritize their own comfort.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), as they have the right to control their wedding guest list. But some might argue that the brother overstepped by targeting his sister's partner. However, since the plus one was rescinded and replaced, and the sister is still invited, the author's action is within their rights. The sister's threat to leave is her choice, but the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision about their event.\n"
