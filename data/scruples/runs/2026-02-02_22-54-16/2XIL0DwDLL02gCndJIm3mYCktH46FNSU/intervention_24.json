I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 27, getting married in April. They gave their sister a plus one when she had an ex-boyfriend who was liked. Now the sister has a new boyfriend who's unemployed, seen as a moocher, and very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because it's supposed to be intimate. The sister is threatening not to attend if he's not allowed. The author found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding is supposed to be with closest friends and family, so they want everyone there to be enjoyable. The sister has been dating the guy for 6 months.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFactors to consider: Wedding etiquette usually allows the couple to set the guest list. If the sister was given a plus one initially, the author can decide to revoke it, especially if the new person is problematic. The author also made an alternative to cover the spot, so there's no financial loss. However, the sister is threatening not to come, which could be a conflict. But the author's right to have a comfortable wedding environment might outweigh the sister's desire to include her partner. \n\nBut maybe the sister's reaction is extreme. Some might argue that the author shouldn't punish the sister for the boyfriend's behavior. However, the author is within their rights to set the guest list. So, the answer is probably B (no). The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to manage the guest list for their wedding, especially for an intimate event. The sister's boyfriend is causing issues, and finding a replacement shows they tried to be fair. The sister's threat is her choice, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to avoid conflict and maintain a good atmosphere.\n"
