I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old guy, decided to rescind his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is a significant event, and typically, the couple has the right to choose their guests. The original plus one was given when the sister had a previous boyfriend, but after a breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. They managed to get a cousin as a replacement, so no financial loss.\n\nNow, the sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the wedding is the couple's event, and they should have control over the guest list. On the other hand, the sister is a family member, and cutting off her plus one might strain their relationship, especially if she's upset. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern, but is that enough to justify rescinding the plus one?\n\nI think the key points are the couple's right to their guest list and the sister's reaction. The author isn't being unreasonable about the guest list, especially if the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. However, the sister's potential absence could be a bigger issue. But the author already arranged a replacement, so maybe the financial aspect isn't a problem. \n\nI don't see the author doing something unethical. The plus one was conditional on the boyfriend's behavior. The sister's threat to not come is her choice, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the wedding's atmosphere. So the answer would be B (No). But wait, maybe some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first. But the author's main point is about being in the wrong, not about the approach. So B is correct.\n"
