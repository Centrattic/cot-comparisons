I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding because they don't like the new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come unless the boyfriend is allowed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules around wedding guest lists. Typically, the wedding couple has the final say on who attends, especially if it's a destination wedding where costs are involved. The original plus one was given to the sister, but the author is within their rights to change that if they're the one paying for the event.\n\nBut there's a family relationship aspect here. The sister is upset and threatening to skip the wedding. That's a big deal. The author's reasoning is that the boyfriend is unemployed, talks too much, and mooches. However, those are personal judgments. Maybe the sister's boyfriend isn't as bad as they seem, or perhaps the author is being judgmental. \n\nAnother point is the timing. It's last minute, but they found a replacement (the cousin) to cover the spot, so no financial loss. That's a good move, but the sister still feels wronged. The author wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family, so they might be justified in wanting to avoid someone they don't like. \n\nHowever, the sister's reaction is strong. If she's not coming, the author might be losing a family member from the event, which is a personal cost. The question is whether the author's decision, while perhaps reasonable, is worth the potential fallout. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the actions were within the person's rights and if they were reasonable. The author's actions are within their rights, but the sister's reaction is also a factor. The answer might depend on whether the author's reasons are valid. If the boyfriend is genuinely problematic, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is being overly judgmental, maybe they are. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and the boyfriend's traits (unemployed at 31, talking too much) are subjective, the author's decision to prioritize their own comfort and wedding vibe is understandable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
