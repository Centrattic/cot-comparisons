I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The author's sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The wedding is the author's event, so they have the right to set the guest list. The sister was given a plus one initially when she had a different boyfriend. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author wants to keep the wedding intimate with close friends and family. They managed to swap the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and considering not attending if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nOn one hand, the author's right to control their wedding guest list is valid. They have a legitimate reason for disliking the boyfriend's behavior and want to maintain an intimate setting. On the other hand, the sister feels the relationship is new, and the boyfriend is part of her life now, so excluding him might feel like a personal attack. However, the sister was warned about the plus one being conditional on the previous boyfriend, and the new situation is objectively causing discomfort. The author isn't being vindictive but addressing actual issues that could spoil the event. The sister's threat to not attend is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they genuinely dislike. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're prioritizing their event's atmosphere and their comfort.\n"
