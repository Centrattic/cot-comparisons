I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend at their wedding. The sister is threatening to not come if she can't bring him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 27-year-old man who gave his sister a plus one when she had a previous boyfriend they liked. Now, with a new one, the family doesn't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative to the point of being overbearing. The author decided to rescind the plus one last minute but managed to get a cousin as a replacement to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and won't come without her boyfriend. They've been dating six months.\n\nSo, the author's main reasoning is about maintaining an intimate wedding with close friends and family. He doesn't want someone he can't stand there. But the sister feels like the plus one is part of her being in the wedding. \n\nNow, considering the arguments. On one hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to set the guest list. If this person is problematic, especially if they're not close to the family, it might make sense to exclude them. Plus, they found a replacement, so no financial loss. \n\nBut on the other hand, the sister is important, and the plus one was given to her. Even if the new boyfriend is a bad fit, rescinding it might hurt her feelings. Also, some might argue that it's not the author's place to judge his sister's partner, especially after only six months. The sister's choice to attend without her boyfriend is her decision, but she's making a stand here. \n\nHowever, the author is the one hosting the wedding, so he has final say on who attends. The plus one was a courtesy based on the previous relationship, not a guarantee. The new boyfriend's traits are concerning, which might affect the wedding atmosphere. The sister's threat is a possible consequence, but the author might be justified in prioritizing the event's ambiance and his own comfort. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's their wedding and their right to choose guests. The sister's reaction is her own, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they dislike. So the answer is B.\n"
