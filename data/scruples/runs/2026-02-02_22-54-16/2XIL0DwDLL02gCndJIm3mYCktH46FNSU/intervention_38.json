I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old guy, rescinded his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not invited. The author believes the wedding should be with close friends and family and doesn't want someone he can't stand there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The original plus one was given when the sister had a previous boyfriend. Now, with a new partner, the author is uncomfortable. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author found a replacement (his cousin) to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and might not attend without her boyfriend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and guests usually choose who to invite. However, family relationships can complicate things. The sister's threat to not come at all is a significant consequence. The author's reasoning is that the wedding is intimate and he wants everyone there to be enjoyable. But is it fair to exclude someone based on dislike, even if they're a partner?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to control his guest list. On the other, excluding someone might push a family member away. The boyfriend has only been in the relationship for six months, so maybe the sister doesn't want to exclude him yet. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if it causes the sister to miss the wedding. But if the author genuinely can't be around the boyfriend, it's understandable to avoid conflict.\n\nThe key points: The author adjusted the plus one to avoid conflict, found a replacement, but the sister is retaliating. The author's stance is about maintaining a pleasant event. However, the sister's potential absence is a major fallout. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it with her first, but ultimately the decision is about his comfort. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. But since he's not forcing her to exclude the boyfriend, just her own plus one, perhaps he's not entirely wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
