I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they dislike the new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 27, their sister is 24. They had given her a plus one when she was with a previous boyfriend, but after they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the sister's new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding, even though it's a destination wedding. They managed to find a cousin to fill the spot so there's no financial loss. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not allowed. The author is worried about being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's decision to remove the plus one, the sister's reaction, and the potential impact on the sister's attendance. \n\nI need to consider typical wedding etiquette. Usually, the wedding party (the bride and groom) have control over the guest list. Since it's a destination wedding, it's more intimate, so they might have strict criteria. The author might feel that the boyfriend's presence would disrupt the event. However, the sister is now threatening to not attend if her boyfriend can't come. That complicates things because it's a family matter.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to decide the guest list for their own wedding. It's a personal event, and they want to ensure everyone there is someone they can enjoy being around. The boyfriend's characteristics (unemployed, mooching, talkative) might be valid concerns for the author's comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a relationship and might feel that her partner is important to include, especially if they've been together for six months. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being questioned, and that her choice of partner is being judged. The threat to not attend is a significant consequence, which the author might not have considered fully.\n\nBut weddings are about the couple, so the author's preferences are valid. However, family dynamics can be tricky. The question is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one. Since they were given the plus one initially and the situation changed, it's within their right to adjust the guest list. However, the sister's reaction is a problem. The author might need to communicate better or find a compromise, but the decision itself might not be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The author could have discussed this with the sister before making the decision. But if they did and the sister still insisted, then the author is justified. However, the user didn't mention prior discussion, just that they \"decided\" to rescind it. That might be a point where the author could have handled it differently.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the plus one is typically given to the wedding party member (like a bridesmaid). However, the sister isn't part of the wedding party unless specified. If the sister is a maid of honor or something, her plus one might be expected. If she's not a part of the wedding party, maybe the author has more leeway.\n\nBut the user didn't specify if the sister is part of the wedding party. The original post just says \"sister\" with a plus one. Maybe the author gave her a plus one out of kindness, but now the situation has changed. The author might feel that the new boyfriend doesn't align with the wedding's vibe.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is about their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. They are not in the wrong for making that choice, but they might have been inconsiderate in how they handled the sister's feelings. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they handled it poorly. Since the author has the right to the guest list, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
