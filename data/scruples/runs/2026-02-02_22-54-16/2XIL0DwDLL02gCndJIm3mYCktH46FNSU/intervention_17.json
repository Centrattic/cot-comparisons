I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend from their wedding. The sister is threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general norms around weddings and family dynamics. Usually, weddings are a mix of personal choice and family expectations. The author gave their sister a plus one before, but after the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, they don't like the new boyfriend and decided to rescind the plus one. \n\nThe key points here are: the wedding is intimate, the author wants everyone present to be someone they enjoy, and they managed to find a replacement (their cousin) to avoid losing money. The sister is upset because she feels the boyfriend should be there, and she might not attend otherwise.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding should include only close friends and family that they like. But taking away a plus one from a sibling, especially when the sibling is threatening to leave, could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. However, the author might have a right to set the guest list according to their comfort.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family relationships. Marriages can affect family dynamics, and if the sister is now considering not attending because of this, it could cause long-term strain. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over family harmony. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic\u2014unemployed, mooching, talkative. The author's family might have valid reasons to be uncomfortable, but is that enough to exclude him? The sister is an adult, and perhaps should have the right to bring someone she chooses, even if the family doesn't approve. \n\nThe timing is last minute, which could be a problem, but the author found a replacement, so maybe that's not the main issue. The core conflict is about the right to control the guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. \n\nIn some cultures, weddings are family-centric, and guests are expected to be there for the couple. However, the couple does have the final say on the guest list. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that decision, but the way it's handled and the potential fallout on family relationships complicates things. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The author has a valid point about the guest list, but the sister's reaction might be an overreaction. However, the author might be in the wrong if it's about respecting their sister's autonomy in bringing a partner. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to curate their wedding guests, especially if the person is causing discomfort. But others might argue the opposite. So, the answer would be B (No), but there are nuances.\n"
