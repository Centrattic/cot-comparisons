I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because he doesn't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one getting married, so he has the final say on who attends, right? Weddings are personal events, and it's common for the couple to decide the guest list. The sister originally had a plus one because they liked her ex, but now the new boyfriend is problematic. The brother mentions that the boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative, making others uncomfortable. \n\nThe sister is upset because she wants to bring her boyfriend. They've only been dating six months, which isn't a long time. The author argues that the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister is threatening to not come if her plus one isn't included. But it's their wedding, so the author might feel justified in making this decision. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Could the author have addressed the situation earlier? The problem is last-minute, so changing the guest list might cause issues. But they managed to get a cousin to take the place, so no money was lost. That shows they tried to handle it responsibly. \n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. Threatening to not attend because her plus one was rescinded could be seen as holding her own attendance hostage. The author might feel that the wedding is their event, and the sister's threat is unreasonable. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered the sister's feelings more. The sister is upset because she wants to bring someone she's dating. However, the author is within his rights to decide the guest list. The boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern if it's going to disrupt the event. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's their wedding and they have the right to choose who attends. The sister's reaction is more extreme, but the author's actions are about maintaining the event's atmosphere. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
