I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The author is a 27-year-old male who's getting married and decided to remove his sister's new boyfriend from the guest list. The sister is 24, and they had originally given her a plus one when she was with a previous boyfriend. Now, she's with someone new who the author's family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talks too much, and mooches off her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings and who gets to decide guest lists. Typically, the couple getting married has the authority to decide who attends. It's their event, so they might prioritize people they feel comfortable with, especially since it's an intimate setting. The author mentions it's a destination wedding, which can be costly, so maybe they want to keep the guest list small.\n\nBut there's a conflict here with the sister. She's threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't invited. The question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points are: the author's right to control the guest list versus the sister's emotional response and her relationship with the author.\n\nThe author did give the sister a plus one initially, but when the relationship changed, he chose to revoke it. He found a replacement (his cousin) to avoid financial loss, which shows consideration. However, the sister is now upset and might not attend. The author's reasoning is about wanting everyone at the wedding to be people he enjoys and the event being intimate.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to choose his wedding guests. It's his event, and he's making a choice to keep the atmosphere positive. On the other hand, it's a family matter, and excluding someone might affect family relationships. However, the sister's boyfriend is not a family member; he's her partner. The author isn't excluding the sister herself, just the boyfriend.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. If she's willing to skip the wedding over this, that's significant. But if the author truly doesn't like the boyfriend and wants the wedding to be pleasant, he's not wrong for making that choice. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative) is problematic for the author, so it's his right to exclude him.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's making a personal choice about his event. The sister's reaction is her issue, but the author isn't obligated to include someone he doesn't like, especially if it's affecting the event's atmosphere. The key is that the author isn't excluding the sister, just the boyfriend. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
