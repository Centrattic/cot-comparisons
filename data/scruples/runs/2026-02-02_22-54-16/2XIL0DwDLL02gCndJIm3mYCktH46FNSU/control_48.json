I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is 27M, getting married in April. The sister is 24F. They originally gave her a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, but the author's immediate family doesn't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to replace him. The sister is threatening to not come if he isn't included, as they've been dating six months.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I should consider the norms around weddings and plus one invitations. Wedding invitations often allow for one guest, and the hosts (the couple) usually have the final say on who is invited. The author is the one planning the wedding, so they have the right to choose the guest list. The sister was given a plus one, but that's conditional on who she brings. If the new boyfriend is problematic, the author can rescind it. \n\nBut the sister is now threatening to not come at all. That's a problem. The author might be concerned about the sister's reaction, but the original agreement was to bring someone the family likes. If the sister's ex was acceptable, then a new partner should be as well, but only if they meet the criteria. The author isn't obligated to include someone they don't want there, especially if it's affecting the overall experience. \n\nThe author mentioned that the wedding is intimate with closest friends and family. The presence of this boyfriend might disrupt that, especially if he's difficult. The author also found a way to avoid financial loss by getting a cousin to take the spot. So, they aren't being inconsiderate of costs. \n\nHowever, the sister might feel disrespected. The six-month duration could be a factor in whether the family should have accepted the new partner. But the author's decision is about wanting a comfortable environment. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's choice isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAnother angle: some might argue that it's rude to cut off a plus one last minute, especially if the sister is upset. But the author is making a choice for their own event. The boyfriend's behavior (mooching, being too talkative) is a valid concern. \n\nIn many cases, the couple's comfort is prioritized in their wedding. So, the author isn't in the wrong for rescinding, even if it upsets the sister. The sister's threat to not attend is her issue, not the author's responsibility. Also, the sister could bring someone else if she wants, but the author already replaced the plus one with a cousin. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they have the right to control their guest list and ensure a good experience for themselves and their close family.\n"
