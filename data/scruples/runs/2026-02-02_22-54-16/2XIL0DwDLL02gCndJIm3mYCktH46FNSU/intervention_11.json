I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The situation is that the sister has a new boyfriend who the author and their immediate family don't like. The author decided to revoke the plus one, which led to the sister threatening not to attend the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are typically personal events where the couple decides the guest list. The author gave the sister a plus one initially, but when the sister's boyfriend came into the picture, they decided it was a bad fit. The author even arranged a replacement to avoid financial loss. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set the guest list and the sister's reaction. The author argues that the wedding should be intimate with close friends and family. The sister, however, feels entitled to bring her boyfriend, leading to a conflict. \n\nFrom a guest list perspective, it's common for the couple to have the final say. However, family obligations can complicate things. The sister's boyfriend is described as problematic\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author's concern about the atmosphere of the wedding is valid. \n\nBut, rescinding a plus one, especially last minute, can be seen as hurtful. The sister's threat to not attend might be an overreaction, but it shows how important this is to her. The six-month relationship duration is a point to consider; some might argue that the boyfriend isn't a long-term partner, so maybe the author should have been more flexible. However, the author's preference for the wedding's vibe is also important. \n\nThe author did try to mitigate the problem by finding a replacement, which shows consideration. However, the sister's feelings are still hurt. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms. If the family usually prioritizes harmony, the author might be seen as being inconsiderate. But if the wedding is a personal choice, the author's decision is justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author has a legitimate reason to exclude someone they don't like, especially if it's affecting the event's quality. On the other hand, the sister might feel disrespected. Since the author tried to find a solution, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer leans towards B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
