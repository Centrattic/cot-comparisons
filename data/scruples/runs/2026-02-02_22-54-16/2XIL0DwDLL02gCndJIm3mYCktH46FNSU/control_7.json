I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who rescinded their sister's plus one is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the sister's new boyfriend is causing issues. The author doesn't like the boyfriend's behavior and wants him excluded, even if it means the sister might not attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship between the user and their sister. Weddings are significant events, and family tensions can escalate. The user initially gave the sister a plus one based on her previous boyfriend, which they liked. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The user doesn't want him there to keep the wedding intimate. They even found a replacement to avoid financial loss.\n\nBut the sister is threatening to leave the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included. The user is asking if they're wrong. The key factors here are the right to control the guest list versus family obligations. Weddings are personal, and the host has the final say. However, the sister might feel that the boyfriend is part of her life now, so excluding him could feel like a personal attack.\n\nOn one hand, the user has the right to ensure their event isn't disrupted. On the other hand, excluding the sister's partner, even if problematic, might strain their relationship. The sister's reaction suggests that the boyfriend is integral to her attendance. The user might be prioritizing their comfort over family, but it's a tough balance. The boyfriend's behavior is valid concern, but the user's approach could be seen as harsh. Perhaps there's a compromise, like limiting the boyfriend's presence or addressing the issues without a complete ban. But the user decided to rescind the plus one and found a replacement, so they might not be in the wrong if they believe the event's atmosphere is important. Still, the sister's potential absence could be a bigger issue. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong, but the user's actions are within their rights to manage their event. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they need to be prepared for possible fallout with their sister.\n"
