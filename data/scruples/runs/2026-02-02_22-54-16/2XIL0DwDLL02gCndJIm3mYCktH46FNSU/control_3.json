I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus-one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user gave their sister a plus-one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now that the sister has a new boyfriend, they don't like him and decided to rescind the plus-one. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included. The user's reasoning is about keeping the wedding intimate with close friends and family, and they even found a replacement plus-one (a cousin) to cover the cost.\n\nPossible points to consider: The user's wedding is their right to manage the guest list. However, the sister is being excluded due to her partner, which might affect her attendance. The timeline is last-minute, which adds pressure. The boyfriend's characteristics (unemployed, talkative, mooching) are subjective. The user's motivation is to have a comfortable event, but excluding someone because of personal dislike could be problematic. However, the user isn't barring the sister from attending; they just rescinded the plus-one. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe the user should have handled it more sensitively.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are the reasonableness of the action and whether it's fair. Here, the user is making a choice about their own wedding, which they have the right to do. However, the sister's potential absence could be a consequence they might not have anticipated. The user could be seen as in the right to control their guest list, especially if they feel the boyfriend isn't a good fit. But maybe the user should have discussed it with the sister first or considered other solutions, like having a private talk with the boyfriend to address concerns instead of rescinding the invitation.\n\nBut since the user did find a replacement plus-one (the cousin) to cover costs, they minimized financial impact. The sister's threat to leave the wedding is a significant consequence. The user's action might be justified, but the sister's reaction is also a problem. However, the user isn't in the wrong for deciding to exclude someone they don't like from their wedding. The right to manage the guest list usually belongs to the couple getting married. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the sister's feelings and the short notice are issues. Still, the user's main point is about their own comfort and the wedding's intimacy, which is a valid consideration.\n"
