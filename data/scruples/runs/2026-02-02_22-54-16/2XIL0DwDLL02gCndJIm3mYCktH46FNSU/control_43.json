I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is a destination event, which adds pressure because travel costs are high. The sister was given a plus one initially when she had an ex, and after breaking up, the writer waited to see who she'd bring next. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The writer decided to rescind the plus one, found another guest to replace him, but the sister is threatening to not come if he isn't included. The writer wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family.\n\nThe main issue here is the balance between family dynamics and personal preferences. The writer has the right to decide who attends their wedding, especially since it's a destination event. However, the sister's reaction is significant because she's a close family member. The writer might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the sister's feelings, but they might not be if they made a reasonable effort to accommodate (like the replacement plus one). The sister's threat to not attend is a problem because weddings are big events for family, but the writer also has the right to set boundaries. \n\nFactors to consider: Last-minute changes can be stressful, but the writer handled it by replacing the plus one. The sister's boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern for the writer's comfort. However, cutting off the sister entirely over this might be too harsh. The answer might hinge on whether the writer communicated clearly and whether the sister is acting irrationally. In AITA scenarios, family obligations often weigh heavily, but personal comfort is also valid. The writer might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuance if the sister's exclusion of her partner could lead to her not attending, which is a bigger issue than the boyfriend.\n"
