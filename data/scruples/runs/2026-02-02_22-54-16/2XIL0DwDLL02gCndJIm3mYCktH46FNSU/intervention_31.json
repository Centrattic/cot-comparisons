I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one because they don't like the boyfriend. The author's sister is threatening not to attend the wedding if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the wedding is intimate with close friends and family. The sister was given a plus one originally because of the ex-boyfriend, but when the new boyfriend came along, the author and family didn't like him. The author decided to rescind the plus one, got a cousin to fill in, and now the sister is upset.\n\nHmm, the author is focusing on keeping the wedding intimate and wanting to enjoy everyone there. The sister's boyfriend is unemployed, talks a lot, mooches off her, and the family doesn't enjoy him. The sister is only there if the boyfriend can come. So, the author is trying to protect the vibe of their special day but might be hurtful to their sister.\n\nBut wait, is it fair for the author to exclude someone just because they don't like them? Weddings are family events, and sometimes you have to include people for the sake of family. The sister might feel betrayed if her partner isn't allowed. Also, the boyfriend has only been in the relationship for six months, maybe it's too early to include him in such a family event. However, the sister is using the threat of not attending, which adds pressure.\n\nBut the author also considered the financial aspect by getting a cousin instead. They might be trying to avoid extra costs. However, the sister's feelings are important too. The author's reasoning is about enjoying the event, but excluding someone can create bigger family issues. Maybe the author should have discussed it with the sister first to understand her side and find a compromise.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event and they have the right to set the guest list. On the other hand, excluding a partner might cause a rift with the sister. The key factors are the reasonableness of the exclusion and the potential consequences. Since the sister is threatening to leave, maybe the author should reconsider or communicate better. But according to the user's question, the answer should be A or B. If the author isn't in the wrong, answer B. But maybe they are in the wrong because they're causing family tension. Hmm.\n"
