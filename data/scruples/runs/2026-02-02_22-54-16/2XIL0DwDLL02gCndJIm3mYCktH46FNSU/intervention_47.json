I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 27-year-old man getting married and he's rescinding his sister's plus one invitation because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to attend the wedding if he can't come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to choose their guests. The author initially gave his sister a plus one to include her previous boyfriend, but after the breakup, he decided to wait. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic in the eyes of the immediate family\u2014unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The key points here are the author's right to set the guest list and the sister's potential reaction.\n\nThe author is being firm about wanting the wedding to be with only close friends and family. He's also trying to avoid losing money by getting a cousin to fill in. That shows some consideration for the sister's feelings and the financial aspect. However, the sister is in a new relationship, and the author is denying a plus one based on his disapproval of the boyfriend. \n\nOn one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and he should have the final say over who attends. On the other hand, cutting off a plus one to a sibling, especially because of a new partner, might come across as controlling or disrespectful. The sister might feel that her personal life is being judged, and since they've only been dating six months, it's possible the author is being overly hasty. \n\nI should also think about the employment status and the \"mooching\" aspect. The boyfriend being 31 and unemployed could be a sensitive issue. The author might feel that this person is a bad influence, but it's also possible that the author is making assumptions without fully understanding the situation. Maybe the boyfriend is in a temporary job or has a different financial situation. \n\nThe plus one is a privilege, not a right, so the author is within his rights to revoke it. But the sister's anger and threat to not attend might be because she feels her relationship is being disrespected. The author's decision could be seen as a personal attack on the boyfriend, even if it's not intended that way. \n\nHowever, the author did mention that the family can't stand the boyfriend, which is a collective feeling. If the sister is bringing someone that the whole family finds unbearable, perhaps it's reasonable to ask her to adjust. But maybe the author should have communicated this decision earlier to avoid last-minute issues. Also, the sister being 24 and in a new relationship might want to be with the person she's with on a significant family occasion. \n\nIn the end, while the author's intention is to keep the wedding intimate, the timing and the way he handled it could be problematic. But legally and in terms of event planning, he's not wrong. However, morally, it depends on how the decision was made and whether there was an attempt to understand the sister's position. The cousin filling in as a replacement plus one is a good move, but the sister's reaction is also valid if she feels her relationship is being invalidated. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because it's his wedding, but he might need to reconsider the approach. The main issue is the plus one being a privilege, so the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong. However, the sister's threat complicates things. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about whether he's wrong, not about resolving the conflict. Since the wedding is his event, he has the right to decide, so B is the answer.\n"
