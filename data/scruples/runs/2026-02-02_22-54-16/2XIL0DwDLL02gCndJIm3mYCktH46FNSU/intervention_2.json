I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The main points are the sister's boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is really talkative. The author doesn't want him at their destination wedding, which is supposed to be intimate, and they replaced him with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider wedding etiquette. Usually, guests are expected to be considerate of the couple's wishes. The author is the one hosting the wedding, so they have the right to decide the guest list. The sister's plus one was initially given because of her ex, but now with a new boyfriend, the author changed their mind. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a red flag for the family. The author didn't want to include someone who would disrupt the event.\n\nHowever, the sister is upset and might not attend, which complicates things. Family dynamics are important here. Maybe the author should have communicated better or considered another solution, like not giving a plus one at all. But the author did replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which shows they tried to be fair. The sister's reaction seems extreme, especially since the relationship is only six months old. It's possible the author's decision is justified to maintain the wedding's atmosphere and their own comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully, but the decision itself isn't necessarily wrong. The key is that the wedding is the author's event, and they have the right to set the tone. If including the boyfriend would make the author uncomfortable or disrupt the event, it's reasonable to exclude him. The sister's threat to not attend is up to her, but the author isn't obligated to let someone into their wedding who they find problematic.\n"
