I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they dislike the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is a destination event, which is more expensive and logistically complex. The author initially gave a plus one to the sister when she had a previous boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who the new partner would be. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed at 31, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author decided not to include him, found a replacement to cover the cost, but the sister is now threatening not to attend.\n\nThe key points here are about the right to control the guest list, especially for a destination wedding where costs are higher. The author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family. The sister is upset because her partner isn't invited, which makes her consider not attending. \n\nIn typical wedding scenarios, the host (the couple getting married) has the authority to decide the guest list. However, family dynamics complicate this. The sister's reaction is significant because she's a family member and her not attending could affect the wedding. But the author's concern is maintaining a comfortable environment for the wedding.\n\nLegally and socially, the wedding couple has the final say on guests. However, there's a balance between personal preference and family relationships. The author might be seen as within their rights, but the sister's potential absence is a consequence they might have to face. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the sister has a right to bring her partner, especially since they've only been dating six months and it's not like the author has known the boyfriend long. However, the author's discomfort with the boyfriend's behavior and lifestyle is valid for wanting to exclude him.\n\nThe fact that the author found a replacement to avoid financial loss shows they tried to mitigate the issue. The sister's threat to not attend is a serious consequence but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision is about their own comfort and the nature of the event. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they have control over their guest list, even if it causes family tension.\n"
