I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one. The sister's boyfriend is 31 and unemployed, doesn't stop talking, and the family doesn't like him. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The initial plus one was given when the sister was with her previous boyfriend, but after the breakup, it wasn't officially confirmed. The author might have assumed they could change their mind since there was a new person involved. But the sister now feels it's unfair, especially since they've been dating for 6 months. \n\nIs it the author's right to decide who attends their wedding? Typically, the wedding couple has the authority to set the guest list, especially if it's an intimate event. However, the sister is also a family member, and if she's attending, maybe the author should consider her feelings. The boyfriend is only 6 months in, so maybe the relationship isn't long enough to be considered a core part of her life yet. \n\nBut the sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. That's a big deal. The author might be causing a rift by removing the plus one. However, the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) could be valid. They might not want someone who could disrupt the event or be a financial burden. \n\nThe author found a replacement with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. That shows they tried to be fair. But was the original plus one a given? If it was a mutual understanding that the plus one is for a significant other, then the author might be overstepping by rescinding it. The problem is the boyfriend's characteristics, not the fact that he's a plus one. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's relationship is personal, and the author's dislike of the boyfriend might be a family issue. The author's right to have a guest list with people they enjoy is important for their own event. Maybe the author and their family should have expressed their concerns earlier, but now it's last minute. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to the guest list versus the sister's feelings and the boyfriend's issues. The answer might hinge on whether the plus one was a guaranteed spot or a conditional one based on the specific person. Since they waited to see who she'd bring, the author could argue they only allowed someone they liked. But the sister might feel it's unfair to be excluded after the relationship has formed. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to choose their guests, especially if the wedding is intimate. However, the approach might have been poor. They should have discussed their concerns with their sister before making the decision to avoid hurt feelings. The sister's reaction is also a bit extreme, but the author's reasons are valid. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
