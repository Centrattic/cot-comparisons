I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The sister's boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and talkative, which the author and their family dislike. The author managed to get a cousin to fill in to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The original plus one was given with the old boyfriend, but when the relationship changed, the author waited before deciding. Now, they feel the new boyfriend doesn't fit the intimate, close-knit vibe they wanted. \n\nOn one hand, the author's responsibility is to their own wedding experience. They might feel that having someone they dislike in attendance could spoil their day. Plus, they found a solution to cover the seat, so there's no financial loss. That seems considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset and threatening to not attend. Family is important, and excluding a sibling could have bigger repercussions. However, the sister was given a plus one initially, and the author had the right to change their mind, especially if it's a destination wedding where the guest list is carefully managed. The boyfriend's behavior might also be a legitimate concern for the event's atmosphere.\n\nBut is it the author's place to judge the sister's partner? The boyfriend being unemployed at 31 isn't necessarily a bad thing; maybe he's in a different life stage. The author's dislike might be personal. However, the author is within their rights to decide the guest list. The sister's reaction is also intense\u2014threatening to leave the wedding entirely. That's a big deal, but the author isn't obligated to let someone they dislike attend. \n\nSo, considering the author's right to manage their wedding and the fact that they found a replacement, I think the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground, like having a conversation with the sister to explain the reasons, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not how to fix it. \n\nI should go with B (No) because the author has the right to their guest list, even if it causes family tension.\n"
