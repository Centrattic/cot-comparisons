I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is getting married and initially gave their sister a plus one. The sister's ex-boyfriend was nice, but her new boyfriend is a problem. The author and their immediate family don't like the new guy because he's unemployed, mooches off the sister, and is super talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, and the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is supposed to be an intimate event with close friends and family. The author is the one organizing the event and has the right to decide the guest list. The sister's boyfriend is a plus one, not an immediate family member. The author isn't excluding the sister herself but just the boyfriend. However, the sister is now saying she won't attend without her boyfriend. \n\nThe key points are: the author tried to be fair by giving the sister a plus one based on her previous relationship, but now the new partner is problematic. The author is trying to maintain the intimacy and comfort of the wedding. The sister's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening to not come. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have considered the sister's feelings more. Even if the plus one is rescinded, the sister is a guest too. The author might be overstepping if they're making the sister choose between her partner and the wedding. However, the author did try to find a solution by getting a cousin to cover the cost. \n\nAnother angle: the sister's boyfriend is only been in the relationship for six months. Maybe the author is being too quick to judge, but then again, the description of the boyfriend's behavior is quite negative. The author's main concern is to enjoy the wedding with people they genuinely like. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they have the right to set the guest list. On the other hand, the sister is a family member, and excluding her partner might cause a rift. But since the sister is an invited guest, maybe the author's decision is justified. The sister might need to understand that the wedding is about the author's comfort. However, the sister's reaction is a problem too. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own event's atmosphere. However, communication could have been better. But given the circumstances, the author's decision is reasonable.\n"
