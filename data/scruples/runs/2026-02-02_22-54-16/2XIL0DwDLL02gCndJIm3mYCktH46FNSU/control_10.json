I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The sister was given a plus one when she was with her ex, but after they broke up, they waited. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding, which is supposed to be intimate. They found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come unless the boyfriend is allowed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and he has the right to choose guests to ensure it's comfortable for him and his close circle. The boyfriend's behavior sounds problematic\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author wants an intimate setting, so it's reasonable to exclude someone who might disrupt that.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset and might not come. Family relationships can be a consideration. But the sister's threat to not attend if her plus one is rescinded is her choice. The author isn't forcing her to come; he's just not allowing the boyfriend. It's a common situation where wedding guests are limited, and plus ones are sometimes restricted, especially if the person is causing discomfort.\n\nAlso, the timing is last minute, but they managed to find a replacement to avoid financial loss. That shows effort to mitigate issues. The author's reasoning is about maintaining the intimate atmosphere and not wanting someone disruptive. It's not about the sister not being allowed, just her guest. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. The sister can choose to attend without the boyfriend, but if she doesn't, that's her decision. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's managing his own event and prioritizing his comfort and the event's vibe."
