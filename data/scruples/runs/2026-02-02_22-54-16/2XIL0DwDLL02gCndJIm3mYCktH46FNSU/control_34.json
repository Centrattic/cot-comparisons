I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's getting married, rescinded their sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he can't go. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the author wants it to be intimate with close friends and family. They had given the sister a plus one before because they liked her ex, but now with a new boyfriend, they don't want him there. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author found a replacement plus one (their cousin) to avoid financial loss.\n\nThe key points are: the author is making a last-minute change, the sister is upset and might not attend without her boyfriend, and the author wants to maintain the intimacy of the wedding.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to decide who attends their wedding. It's their event, and they can set the guest list. They did replace the plus one, so there's no financial loss. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern, which might affect the wedding atmosphere. The author might be protecting their own comfort and the event's vibe.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being asked to choose between attending the wedding without her boyfriend or not attending at all. That could be hurtful, especially if the sister feels her relationship is being judged. The six-month timeline is relatively short, but the author might not want someone who's a burden on the guest list. However, rescinding a plus one so close to the event could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister has already made plans with her boyfriend.\n\nAlso, the sister's threat to not come complicates things. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's attendance, which could strain family relations. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having the boyfriend attend but not as a plus one, but the author didn't consider that.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be justified if the boyfriend's presence truly disrupts the event. However, the way it's handled\u2014last minute, no prior discussion\u2014could be seen as harsh. The sister's reaction is understandable if she feels her autonomy is being challenged. The author could have had a conversation to understand if there's a compromise, but instead made a unilateral decision.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author might not be entirely wrong in wanting to protect their event, but the approach could be seen as dismissive of their sister's feelings. The answer might hinge on whether the author's justification is valid enough to override the sister's needs.\n"
