I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the author and their family don't like him. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is the author's, so they have control over the guest list. They have the right to decide who attends. The sister was given a plus one initially when she was with her previous boyfriend, but now with a new partner, the author feels uncomfortable. The new boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch, and is very talkative. The author wants an intimate event with close friends and family, so the presence of someone they dislike could disrupt that. They even found a replacement guest to avoid financial loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset and might not attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The relationship has only been six months, which is a relatively short time. But the author's main point is about wanting to enjoy the event without someone they can't stand. \n\nI should check if there's any obligation to include the sister's partner. Typically, family members do have some say, but the guest list is usually the couple's decision. The sister might feel it's unfair, but the author's right to choose their guests is a strong point. The sister's threat to not come is a consequence, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their decision. So the answer is B.\n"
