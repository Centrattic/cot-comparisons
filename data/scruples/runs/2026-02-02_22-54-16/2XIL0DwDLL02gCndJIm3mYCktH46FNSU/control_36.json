I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author rescinded their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not included.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author gave their sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who the sister would bring. The new boyfriend is 31 and unemployed, described as a mooch and very talkative. The author doesn't want him there because they don't get along. They found a cousin to replace him, so there's no financial loss. The sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author has the right to rescind the plus one. Weddings are personal events, and usually, the hosts (the getting married) have control over the guest list. The sister's plus one is at the discretion of the hosts. The problem here is that the author is making a decision that affects the sister's attendance. The sister is threatening to not come, which is a significant consequence.\n\nBut the author argues it's an intimate wedding with close friends and family. The boyfriend is described as problematic, so maybe the author is trying to maintain a comfortable environment. However, by rescinding the plus one, the author is essentially choosing between the sister and the boyfriend. The sister is family, so the author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the sister's relationship. But is that fair?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, common advice is to consider the impact on relationships. If the sister really doesn't want to come without her boyfriend, then the author's decision could lead to a bigger rift. The author might be in a tough spot, but they need to weigh the consequences. The sister's reaction is strong, which suggests the author's decision is causing family tension. The author might be right in wanting control over their wedding, but the sister's response is about her right to attend with her partner. \n\nHowever, the author did replace the plus one with a cousin, so maybe the focus is on the sister being upset because the boyfriend isn't allowed. The key question is whether the author overstepped by removing the plus one. Since the original plus one was given based on the ex-boyfriend, and the new boyfriend is problematic, the author might feel justified. But the sister's reaction is a point against the author. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue both sides. The hosts have the right to their guest list, but family members might feel their inclusion is important. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable because they want to keep the wedding positive, but the sister's response is about her emotional connection. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, given that the author made a unilateral decision affecting a family member's attendance, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the wedding is their event and they're allowing the cousin instead, perhaps not. The answer might depend on cultural norms or expectations. In many cases, the hosts do have the final say, so the author might be in the right. However, the sister's potential absence is a significant consequence. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to control their wedding guest list. The sister's reaction is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they dislike, especially when it's a close-knit event. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
