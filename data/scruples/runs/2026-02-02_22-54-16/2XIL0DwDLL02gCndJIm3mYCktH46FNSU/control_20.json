I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. The sister is threatening not to attend if he isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister was given a plus one before, but after the breakup, the author decided to wait. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like. The author rescinds the plus one, and the sister is upset. The author mentions it's a destination wedding, which is expensive, but they found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't there.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to choose guests for their own wedding, especially since it's an intimate event. The sister's reaction is about the boyfriend being included, which she sees as important. The boyfriend's behavior is described negatively, but the author's main concern is the enjoyment of the event.\n\nWedding guest lists are personal. The author has the right to set the tone and atmosphere they want. The sister's plus one was contingent on her partner, but if the partner is problematic, the author might feel justified in removing him. However, the sister's threat to not attend complicates things. The author might be caught between their comfort and family dynamics.\n\nBut the sister had the opportunity to choose whether to bring someone. The author made a decision based on the new boyfriend's behavior. The author did replace the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss, which is a point in their favor. The sister might be using the threat to force the author to include the boyfriend, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision could be seen as cutting off family over a partner. The sister might feel that her partner is part of her life and should be included. But the author's wedding is their event, and they should have the final say. The fact that the sister is now threatening not to attend suggests she might be prioritizing her partner over the wedding, which could be her own choice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's actions are about their own comfort and the nature of the event. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to set the guest list. The sister's reaction is about her partner's inclusion, not her own. So the author is not in the wrong because they are the one hosting the event and can make those decisions. The sister's threat is more about her own stance rather than the author's wrongdoing. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
