I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave the sister a plus one initially when she was with an ex, but now the sister has a new boyfriend. The author and their immediate family don't like this new guy because he's unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin as a replacement to avoid losing money, and now the sister is threatening not to come.\n\nThe main issue here revolves around the author's right to control the guest list versus the sister's right to bring someone with her. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for the couple to set the guest list. However, the sister's reaction is also significant because she might feel that her choice of partner is being judged.\n\nI should consider if the author acted unreasonably. The author waited until the last minute, but they did find a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister's boyfriend has been in a 6-month relationship, which might be a valid reason for the sister to want him there. However, the author's concern about the wedding atmosphere and the boyfriend's behavior could justify their decision, especially if they're aiming for an intimate event with close friends and family.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. Threatening not to attend is a heavy response, which might indicate that the author's decision is causing a rift in the family. It's possible that the author should have communicated better or considered the sister's feelings more before making the change. But since the author prioritizes their own comfort and the event's atmosphere, that's a valid stance too.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with consideration and if their actions directly caused harm. The author tried to mitigate financial loss, which shows they considered the sister's potential reaction. However, the sister's attachment to her boyfriend might mean that the author's decision is affecting more than just the wedding logistics\u2014it's a personal issue.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's right to control guests vs. the sister's right to bring her partner. The author's reasons are based on personal discomfort with the boyfriend's traits, which is a subjective judgment. While the author isn't in the legal wrong, socially, it's a gray area. The sister's threat complicates things, but it's her choice to respond that way.\n\nIn terms of the answer, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their wedding guest list. However, the sister's reaction shows the decision is causing family tension. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong, and since the author made a considered decision to maintain their event's integrity, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
