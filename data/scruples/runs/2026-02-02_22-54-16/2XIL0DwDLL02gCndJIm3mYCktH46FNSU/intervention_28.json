I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author, who's getting married, decided to take back the plus one they gave their sister because of her new boyfriend. The sister is upset and might not come to the wedding if he's not included. The author says they want the wedding to be intimate and with people everyone is comfortable around. The sister's boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and talks a lot. They managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one so no money is lost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and feelings of both parties. The author is the one hosting the wedding, which is a big event, and they have the right to set the guest list, right? Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually decides who to invite. If the sister's boyfriend is causing discomfort to the author and their close family, it's understandable that they'd want to exclude him. Especially since they mentioned it's an intimate setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is strong\u2014threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't included. That's a big deal. The sister might feel that her choice in a partner is being judged or that her autonomy is being violated. However, the author isn't banning the sister from the wedding; they're just removing the plus one. The sister could still attend without her boyfriend. But she's choosing not to, which complicates things.\n\nI should also consider the timing. It's last minute, which might make it harder for the sister to adjust her travel plans. But the author mentions that they found a cousin to take the place, so maybe the financial aspect isn't an issue. That's a point in the author's favor because they're trying to be considerate.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's boyfriend is new, only six months in. Maybe the author and their family haven't had much time to get to know him, and their judgment is based on initial impressions. But if the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely causing discomfort, like being unemployed and talkative, that could be legitimate concerns for an intimate gathering.\n\nHowever, the sister might feel that the author is being unfair because it's not the author's place to judge her relationships. But the wedding is the author's event, so they do have some authority over the guest list. It's a balance between family dynamics and personal event management.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're protecting their event's atmosphere. The sister's reaction is emotional, but the author's decision is about their own comfort and the event's intimacy. The author's actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
