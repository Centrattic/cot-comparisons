I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him. The author is the one getting married and wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family. The sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of weddings. Typically, the couple has the final say on their guest list. It's their event, so they can choose who to invite. The sister had a plus one initially because her ex-boyfriend was liked, but now she has a new partner that the family finds objectionable. The author's reasoning is that they want everyone at the wedding to be enjoyable and part of the close circle. \n\nThe boyfriend is unemployed, described as a mooch, and a talkative person. These are valid concerns for a small, intimate event where the couple wants to avoid someone who might be a drain or too loud. The author also offered to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which is considerate. \n\nThe sister is upset and threatening to not attend, but the author believes they should be able to set the guest list. The sister's argument is that the boyfriend should be included, but six months is not a long relationship, so maybe the author isn't obligated to invite someone who isn't part of the family. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her personal choice is being overruled, but the wedding is the couple's event. The author's decision isn't just about the sister's happiness but about the overall event. The key points here are the couple's right to control the guest list and the sister's reaction. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's their wedding and they have the authority to decide. The sister's threat is unreasonable given the circumstances, and the author acted responsibly by finding a replacement. So the answer should be B.\n"
