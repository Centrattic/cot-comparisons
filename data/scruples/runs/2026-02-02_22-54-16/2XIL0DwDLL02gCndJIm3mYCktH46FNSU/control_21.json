I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The brother is getting married and had given his sister a plus one because she was with a previous boyfriend they liked. Now she has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is really talkative. The brother decides to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and managed to get his cousin to take that spot. The sister is threatening not to attend unless her boyfriend is allowed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wedding is supposed to be intimate, with close friends and family. The original plus one was given when the sister was with someone they liked. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic. The author wants to exclude him because they don't want someone who might be disruptive. On the other hand, the sister feels that her choice of partner should be respected, and her attending the wedding hinges on him being allowed.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is the one hosting the wedding and has the final say on the guest list. Typically, the couple's preferences take precedence in their own event. However, there's a potential issue of family dynamics. The sister is being excluded by her partner's presence not being allowed, which could cause a rift. But the author's reasoning is that they want the event to be pleasant for everyone, and they made a decision to ensure that.\n\nThe sister's threat to not attend is a consequence the author might have to face. But is that the author's fault? If the sister is prioritizing her boyfriend over her sibling's wedding, that's her choice. The author might feel justified in their decision because the wedding is their own and they want to control the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there might be a lack of communication or understanding. The author could have tried to mediate or talk to the sister first before rescinding. But the situation was last minute, and they did find a replacement. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The key factors are the author's right to the guest list and the sister's overreaction. The answer might be No (B), but there's a nuance. However, in AITA scenarios, the host's decisions are usually respected unless there's malice. The author isn't excluding the sister, just the boyfriend. So, B seems more likely.\n"
