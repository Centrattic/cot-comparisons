I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is the author's, so he's the one organizing it and setting the guest list. He originally gave his sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend, but after the breakup, she brought a new guy who the family doesn't like. The boyfriend is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author decided to remove the plus one and found a replacement (his cousin), so no money is lost. The sister is now threatening not to attend if her boyfriend can't come.\n\nThe author's main point is about wanting everyone at the wedding to be their closest family and friends. He's concerned about the intimate setting and not wanting someone who's not well-liked. But the sister is being the plus one because she's family, right? So the question is whether the author has the right to remove her guest without her consent.\n\nOn one hand, the wedding is his event, and he has the right to decide who attends. Especially if it's an intimate affair, he might feel it's important to keep the guest list to people he's comfortable with. The boyfriend is described as problematic, which could affect the atmosphere. Also, they managed to replace the plus one without financial loss, which is a responsible move.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is a family member, and removing her plus one could be seen as cutting her off. The sister might feel that since she's part of the family, her partner should be allowed. The timeframe is last minute, which adds stress, but the author seems to have handled that by securing a replacement. However, the sister's threat to not attend raises the stakes. Is it fair for her to prioritize the boyfriend over the wedding? Maybe not, but the author's decision might still impact their relationship.\n\nBut the key here is that the plus one was given to the sister. If the author had the authority to grant a plus one in the first place, he should have the authority to rescind it, especially if the person is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the sister's boyfriend is a close enough connection that the author should have discussed it with her first. However, the author did mention they were waiting to see who she'd bring after the breakup. \n\nThe sister's reaction is to not attend, which could be seen as an overreaction. But families can be sensitive, and she might feel her autonomy is being challenged. However, the author's primary responsibility is to his own wedding experience. If the boyfriend's presence is disruptive and not in line with the event's purpose, then maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whose request is more legitimate. The author wants to maintain a certain guest list for his own comfort and the wedding's integrity. The sister is asserting that her relationship is important enough to require a plus one. But since the plus one was given to her, the author might have the right to change it, especially if the person in question is not well-liked. However, the author should have communicated this decision earlier. The last-minute nature might be a problem, but he did handle the replacement. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wedding is his event and he has the right to set the guest list. But I should also consider cultural or family expectations. Maybe in their family, siblings have the right to bring a partner regardless. However, the boyfriend has negative traits, so the author is justified in wanting him excluded for the sake of the event. The sister's threat is a consequence, but it doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n"
