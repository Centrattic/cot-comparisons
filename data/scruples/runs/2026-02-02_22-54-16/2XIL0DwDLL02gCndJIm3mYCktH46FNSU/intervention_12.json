I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding. The author is 27M, sister is 24F, new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, and everyone in the immediate family doesn't like him. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not invited. The author thinks the wedding should be with close friends and family and doesn't want people they can't stand there. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Wedding guest lists can be a sensitive topic. The author had given a plus one based on the previous boyfriend, but now the new one is causing issues. The key points are the author's right to choose their wedding guests, the sister's reaction, and the potential impact on family relationships.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to decide who attends. However, cutting off a family member's plus one, especially last minute, might cause family tension. The sister's threat to not attend if her boyfriend isn't there adds complexity. The author tried to mitigate the problem by getting a cousin to cover the costs, so there's no financial loss. \n\nBut is it fair to rescind the plus one based on personal dislike? The boyfriend's traits are listed as unemployed, mooching, and talkative. But is that enough? The author's reasoning is about wanting an intimate setting with people they enjoy. On one hand, the author's right to their comfort at their own wedding is valid. On the other hand, excluding someone could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister feels her partner's presence is important. \n\nHowever, the sister being the one who might not attend is also a consequence. The author might be prioritizing their event's atmosphere over family relations. But if the sister chooses not to come, that's her decision. The author isn't forcing her to leave the wedding; they're just not allowing her plus one. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong because they have the right to their guest list. The sister's reaction is more about her stance on the relationship, not necessarily the author's decision. The author made an effort to handle the cost, which shows consideration. The boyfriend's behavior could be valid concerns for the author's event. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
