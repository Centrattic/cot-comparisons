I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is getting married and initially gave their sister a plus one. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The sister started dating a new guy, and the author and family don't like him. He's unemployed, mooching off her, and too talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister is upset because the boyfriend has only been in the relationship for six months. \n\nNow, considering etiquette and common practices. Typically, guests at a wedding are close family and friends. A plus one for a sibling is common, but the choice of who they bring can be an issue if others are uncomfortable. However, removing someone because of personal dislike might be problematic. \n\nThe author might argue that it's their wedding and they have the final say on guests. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her autonomy in choosing her guest is being taken away, especially if the relationship isn't long-term. Also, the sister threatening to not attend could be a significant consequence. \n\nFactors to consider: Is the boyfriend a moocher? That's a red flag, but is that enough for the author to remove him? The author's right to an intimate event vs. the sister's right to bring someone. Also, the timing is last minute, which might add stress. \n\nIn some cases, families might handle this by having a private conversation with the sister to express concerns and see if she can choose someone else. But the author did that by rescinding and replacing. However, the sister's reaction is a problem. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author might believe they have the right to decide who attends their wedding. But the sister's potential absence could harm family relations. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable. If the boyfriend is problematic, maybe it's justified. But if it's just personal dislike, it's less so. The author's reasoning about the intimate setting supports their decision. However, the sister's threat to leave is a consequence they might not want. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with considerations about handling it more sensitively.\n"
