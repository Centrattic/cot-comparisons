I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for the sister's new boyfriend at a wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points: The brother (27M) gave his sister (24F) a plus one initially when she was with her old boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. She brought a new boyfriend who the brother and immediate family don't like. The brother decides to rescind the plus one, finds a cousin to cover the spot, and now the sister is threatening not to attend the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe user is asking if the brother is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nNow, considering the context. The wedding is a destination event, which might make last-minute changes harder. The brother's rationale is that he wants everyone at the wedding to be people he enjoys, keeping it intimate. The sister has been with the boyfriend for six months, and she's now refusing to attend without him. The brother didn't specify the exact reason the boyfriend is not allowed beyond the brother's dislike, but mentions unemployment, mooching, and being loud.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, guests often have control over their plus ones, especially in a destination wedding where costs are higher. However, the sister is close to the brother, so cutting off her plus one might strain their relationship. The brother did make an effort to cover the cost by getting a cousin to take the spot, which is considerate. But the sister's reaction of threatening not to attend is extreme, as the wedding is a significant family event.\n\nThe question is whether the brother overstepped. On one hand, the wedding is his event, and he should feel comfortable with all attendees. On the other hand, excluding someone's partner, even if they're not married, can be seen as harsh. However, since they've only been dating for six months, it's not as formal as a spouse. The brother's actions might be justified if the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, but the timing is very last-minute, which adds stress.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the host has the right to manage their guest list, especially in a destination wedding. The sister's refusal to attend is a serious consequence, indicating that the brother's decision might have a bigger impact than anticipated. However, the brother isn't forcing her to attend; he's making a choice that she's now rejecting. The question is whether his choice is unreasonable. Given that he's the one hosting, and the wedding is his event, many might side with him. But others might feel it's unkind to exclude someone's partner, especially if the relationship is relatively new and the sister is upset.\n\nConsidering all factors, the brother's decision is within his rights as the host, but the sister's response is extreme. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the host should have control over the guest list. However, there's a nuance here because family relationships are involved. However, since the plus one is part of the wedding planning and the brother made an effort to cover the cost, it's more about his comfort and the event's intimacy.\n"
