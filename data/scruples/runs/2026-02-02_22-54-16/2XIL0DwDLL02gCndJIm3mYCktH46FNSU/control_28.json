I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is getting married and had given their sister a plus one. The sister's ex-boyfriend was nice, but now she's with a new guy that the author's family doesn't like. The author is rescinding the plus one because they can't stand the boyfriend's behavior\u2014unemployed, talkative, mooching. They found a cousin to take his place so there's no financial loss. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. Weddings are personal events, and guests often have some control over their guest list. The author mentions it's an intimate wedding with close friends and family, which suggests they want to keep certain people out. The boyfriend is only six months into the relationship, so maybe that's a reason to be cautious. Also, the boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative) are issues that could disrupt the event. \n\nBut then, the sister is upset because she wants to bring her partner. It's her right to attend with someone, but the author might feel it's too late to change things. The sister is threatening to not attend at all if she can't bring her boyfriend. That's a big deal because family attendance is important. The author might be causing a rift here. However, the author is trying to maintain the integrity of their event. \n\nThe key points: The author's reasons are based on personal dislike of the boyfriend's traits, which might be a bit subjective. The sister's reaction is intense. The author made a last-minute change, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author did find a replacement to avoid financial loss, which is thoughtful. \n\nIs rescinding a plus one based on not liking someone's new partner wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say it's their event, so they have the right. Others might say it's unfair to exclude someone based on a short-term relationship. The sister is reacting strongly, which could indicate that the author's decision is causing more harm than good. However, the author's intent is to have an intimate event without people they dislike. \n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here, but the author's actions are within their rights as the event host. However, the way they handled it might not consider the sister's feelings enough. The sister's threat to skip the wedding is a significant consequence. Still, the author's primary concern is about their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a tricky situation.\n"
