I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The main issue is the brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because he doesn't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother and sister are getting married, and the sister was given a plus one previously when she had another boyfriend. Now, with a new boyfriend who the family doesn't like, the brother decides to revoke the plus one. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded.\n\nThe brother's reasoning is that he wants the wedding to be with their closest friends and family, and he doesn't want to include someone he finds objectionable. On the other hand, the sister feels that her boyfriend is important to her and should be included. \n\nI should think about common AITA scenarios. Usually, the host of an event has the right to decide the guest list. However, there's a family relationship here. The sister is a family member attending with a plus one. If the sister's presence is conditional on her boyfriend's inclusion, that complicates things. The brother might be prioritizing his comfort and the event's atmosphere, but excluding someone close to a family member can cause tension. \n\nBut wait, the sister is an adult and can choose to attend without her boyfriend. However, she's threatening to leave the wedding altogether if he's excluded. That seems like a strong reaction. The brother might feel that his wedding should be respectful to his immediate family's preferences. \n\nThe key points are: the brother's right to manage the guest list, the sister's right to attend with someone she's in a relationship with, and the potential for family conflict. The brother did offer a solution by getting a cousin to cover the plus one to avoid financial loss, which shows he's trying to be fair. \n\nHowever, by rescinding the plus one, the brother is imposing his family's discomfort on his sister's personal life. It might be seen as unfair because the sister's boyfriend is part of her life, and excluding him could be a personal choice for the brother but not necessarily the sister's. \n\nBut the brother could argue that he's within his rights as the host. The sister's reaction is extreme, but it's her choice to attend. The brother might be in the right because he's managing his event, but there's a risk of alienating family. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the host does have control over the guest list, but if a family member is being excluded, especially a sibling, it can be a gray area. The brother's action is understandable, but the sister's threat to skip the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed is also a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the brother might not be in the wrong because he's hosting his wedding and can set the terms. However, the sister's threat to miss the wedding complicates things. But since the brother is trying to maintain the intimacy and comfort of the event, maybe he's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, excluding someone's partner might be seen as harsh. But since it's a destination wedding, maybe the brother is within his rights to manage the logistics and the vibe of the event. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the host has the right to decide the guest list, even if it causes some family tension. The sister's choice to attend without her boyfriend is her decision, but the brother isn't obligated to allow someone who's causing discomfort.\n"
