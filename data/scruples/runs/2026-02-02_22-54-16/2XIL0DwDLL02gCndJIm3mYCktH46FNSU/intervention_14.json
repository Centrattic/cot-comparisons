I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for a sister's boyfriend at a wedding. The author is a 27-year-old guy getting married, and his sister, 24, had a plus one. They liked her ex-boyfriend, but after they broke up, she started dating someone new. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The author decided to rescind his plus one, found a cousin to replace him, but the sister is now threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different perspectives. The author organized an intimate wedding with close friends and family. They had given the sister a plus one based on her previous relationship, but now the new partner is problematic. The author's main concern is the atmosphere of the wedding, as they want everyone there to be comfortable. The sister, however, is upset and considering not attending if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The key issue here is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author might have valid reasons. The wedding is their event, and they have the right to curate the guest list to ensure it's enjoyable. If the boyfriend is causing discomfort, it's reasonable to exclude him. However, the sister's reaction is also a point to consider. Threatening not to attend could be seen as holding the author's event hostage, which complicates things. But the author did offer a solution by replacing the plus one with a cousin, which might mitigate some of the sister's objections.\n\nLegally, as the wedding organizer, the author has the authority to decide the guest list. Emotionally, the sister might feel that her relationship is being policed, which could be hurtful. The duration of the relationship (6 months) might be a factor in whether the author should have known about the boyfriend earlier. But the author also has the right to make last-minute changes, especially if the guest list is causing conflict.\n\nAnother angle: family dynamics. Siblings can have strong bonds, and this decision might strain their relationship. However, the author is prioritizing their own event. It's a tough spot, but the author's reasons are based on wanting an enjoyable experience for themselves and their guests, which is a valid consideration.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's likely the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
