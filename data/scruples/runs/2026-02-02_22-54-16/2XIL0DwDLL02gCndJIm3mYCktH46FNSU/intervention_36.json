I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because of her new boyfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The sister originally had a plus one, which was her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring.\n2. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seen as mooching, and very talkative, which the immediate family doesn't like.\n3. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a replacement (their cousin) to avoid financial loss.\n4. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding should be an intimate gathering with close friends and family, and he wants everyone there to be enjoyable. The sister argues she won't attend without her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on guests. However, the sister is a close relative, and cutting off her plus one might affect her attendance. The author's concern is about the environment of the wedding, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployment, mooching, talkative) is a red flag for the family, but personal opinions on someone else's partner can be tricky.\n\nThe sister's reaction is intense\u2014threatening not to attend. That's significant because the author still wants her there. By replacing the plus one with a cousin, they tried to maintain the guest count and avoid financial loss, which shows consideration. But the sister's attachment to the boyfriend is causing conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have the right to control their wedding guests. The issue is whether rescinding a plus one over personal dislike is justified. The boyfriend's unemployed status and mooching might be valid concerns if it affects the wedding's atmosphere. However, six months is a short time, and the sister might feel her relationship is being judged. The author's action could be seen as overstepping if the sister feels her choice of partner is being invalidated. But since the wedding is a private event, the author's decision is about creating a comfortable environment for themselves and their close family. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family expectations. But given the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're prioritizing the event's intimacy and their own comfort, even if it causes tension.\n"
