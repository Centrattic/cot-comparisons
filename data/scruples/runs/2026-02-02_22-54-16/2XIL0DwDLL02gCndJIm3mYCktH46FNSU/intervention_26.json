I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the wedding is an intimate event with close family and friends. The author originally gave the sister a plus one when she had a previous boyfriend, who they liked. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative, which the immediate family doesn't enjoy. The author decided to rescind the plus one, citing the desire for everyone at the wedding to be people they enjoy. They managed to get a cousin to fill the spot, so no money was lost. The sister is now threatening to not attend unless the boyfriend comes.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to choose their wedding guest list and the sister's reaction. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts typically have the final say on who attends. The author's reasoning is that they want to enjoy the guests, and the boyfriend's presence might detract from that. However, the sister is using the threat of not attending, which complicates things. \n\nIs the author justified in removing the plus one? If the wedding is meant to be a close-knit event, and the boyfriend doesn't fit the vibe, the author has a point. But, the sister's feelings are also important. The issue is whether the author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. The boyfriend's behavior could be a valid concern for the author's comfort. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her choice of partner is being judged, which could lead to family tension. \n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between the author's right to their guest list and the sister's autonomy. If the author's decision is based on personal preference rather than any harmful behavior by the boyfriend, it's a gray area. However, since the author is paying for the wedding and designed it as an intimate event, their decision might be seen as valid. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening not to attend is a strong move, but it's her choice how to respond. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have control over their event. However, the situation could benefit from communication and compromise. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with consideration for the sister's feelings as well.\n"
