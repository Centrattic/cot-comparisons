I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a 27-year-old male getting married. He gave his sister a plus one, originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who the sister would bring. Now, she's dating a new guy that the family doesn't like. The guy is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative to the point of being annoying. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid financial loss, and the sister is now threatening not to attend the wedding if he can't go.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nKey points to consider: The wedding is intimate with close friends and family. The author wants everyone there to be people they enjoy. The sister is upset because she's been with the boyfriend for 6 months. The author made a decision last minute, but managed to replace the plus one without losing money. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being wrong: Weddings are family events, and excluding someone's partner might be seen as cutting off the sister. The sister might feel hurt if her relationship isn't recognized. The decision is last-minute, which could be stressful for the sister. Also, the boyfriend's flaws don't necessarily mean he should be excluded unless he's problematic enough to ruin the event.\n\nArguments for the author not being wrong: The wedding is their event, and they have the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployment, mooching, talkative) might make the author uncomfortable. The author tried to find a solution (cousin) to avoid financial issues. The sister could choose not to attend, but that's her choice. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the integrity of the event.\n\nI need to weigh these points. The author's reasoning is about wanting everyone at the wedding to be people they enjoy. The sister's boyfriend is problematic. However, the sister is now threatening not to attend, which could be a bigger issue. But the author might feel that their event should be stress-free. The plus one policy is usually up to the couple, so they can set those rules. The sister can choose to attend without the boyfriend, but if she can't, it's her decision. The author isn't wrong for making a choice that affects their own event. The boyfriend's presence might cause more tension. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
