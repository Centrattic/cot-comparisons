I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one due to not liking her new boyfriend. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the timing of the decision, and the sister's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author is 27 and getting married in the Caribbean as a destination wedding. The sister initially had a plus one for her ex-boyfriend, who they liked. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to take advantage of the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him so there's no financial loss, but now the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if the boyfriend can't attend.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts. So, the question is whether the author is justified in making this decision. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are personal events, and the author has the right to set the guest list, especially since it's an intimate setting. They might feel that including someone they don't get along with could affect the experience for everyone. The new boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, dominating conversations) could be a legitimate concern about the guest atmosphere and potential stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her personal life is being judged. The boyfriend has only been in their lives for six months, and it's possible the author and their family formed a negative opinion quickly. The sister might also feel that her inclusion in the wedding is being conditional on her relationship, which could imply that her presence is tied to the boyfriend, not her own relationship with the author. Additionally, rescinding the plus one last minute could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they found a replacement. The sister might have already made plans with her boyfriend, and changing the plus one could cause her inconvenience or embarrassment.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the author's actions to affect their relationship with their sister. If the sister chooses not to attend, that's a significant consequence. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's feelings, which could be a point of contention. However, if the sister's boyfriend is genuinely problematic and the author believes it's necessary to maintain the wedding's vibe, there's an argument for their decision.\n\nThe fact that they found a replacement to avoid financial loss is a positive step, but the sister still feels it's a personal attack. There's also the aspect of respect in relationships\u2014should family members be allowed to bring partners unless there's a valid reason to exclude them? The author's reasoning might be valid, but the way the decision was handled could be part of the problem. Maybe the author should have communicated earlier or given the sister a chance to reflect on the situation without abruptly revoking the plus one. \n\nI think the core issue is the author's right to control their wedding guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. If the author has a genuine reason (like the boyfriend being disruptive or problematic), they might not be in the wrong. However, if the decision is based on personal dislike without substantial issues, it could be seen as unfair. The boyfriend's unemployment and apparent mooching might be legitimate concerns, especially in a destination wedding where costs are higher. The talkativeness could also impact the event's atmosphere. \n\nBut considering that the sister is threatening to not come at all, the author might need to weigh the importance of their sister's attendance versus the discomfort the boyfriend might bring. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first and explaining their concerns without immediately revoking the plus one. However, the author did act to prevent financial loss, which shows they tried to be considerate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person in the middle is seen as having some responsibility in how they handle the situation. Even if the decision is understandable, the approach might be what's causing the conflict. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there could be aspects of their handling that contribute to the sister's upset. \n\nGiven the details, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to curate their guest list for a destination wedding, which is typically smaller. The boyfriend's characteristics are objectively problematic, and the author did find a replacement to avoid financial issues. However, the sister's reaction is also a red flag, suggesting the author might need to reconsider the importance of their relationship. But strictly based on the question of whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding the plus one, the answer is more likely B (No).\n"
