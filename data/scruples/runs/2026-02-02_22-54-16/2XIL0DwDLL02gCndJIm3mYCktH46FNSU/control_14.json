I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend at the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author gave their sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because they don't enjoy his presence and it's an intimate event. They found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if he isn't included.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wedding is intimate, meant for close friends and family. The author has the right to choose their guest list. The sister's new boyfriend is not well-liked by the immediate family. The author made a last-minute change but found a replacement to avoid financial loss.\n\nFrom what I understand, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're trying to maintain a comfortable environment for their wedding. The sister might feel that her choice of partner should be respected, but the author has the final say on their own event. The fact that they offered a replacement shows they're trying to be accommodating. The sister's threat to not attend is a possible consequence, but the author's decision is about their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the focus is on the guest of honor's rights. Since it's their wedding, they have the authority to decide who attends. The sister's boyfriend isn't a close family member, so excluding him isn't necessarily inconsiderate. The author isn't being malicious; they have valid concerns about the guest's behavior and unemployment. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance if the sister's exclusion is more about the boyfriend than the wedding itself. However, the author's stance seems justified.\n"
