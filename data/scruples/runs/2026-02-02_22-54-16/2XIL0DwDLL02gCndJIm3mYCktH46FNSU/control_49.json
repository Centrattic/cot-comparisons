I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is a guy getting married and rescinding his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is a destination event, which probably means higher costs and more planning. The sister had a plus one initially when she was with her ex, and after breaking up, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, mooches off her, and is very talkative. The user wants everyone at the wedding to be people he can get along with, especially since it's an intimate setting.\n\nNow, from a wedding planning standpoint, plus ones are sometimes given based on the guest's partner or significant other. If the sister is attending, having a plus one makes sense. However, if the boyfriend is causing discomfort and the user is the one footing the bill, maybe he has a right to decide who is there. But the sister is saying she won't come without her boyfriend. That's a problem because it's the user's wedding, but family dynamics can be tricky.\n\nI should think about the reasoning. The user's main point is about enjoying the guests and keeping it close-knit. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, mooching, talkative) are personal judgments. Are those valid reasons to exclude someone? Maybe, especially if it's a small wedding where interactions are more frequent. However, excluding someone can cause family tension. The sister's reaction is to not attend, which is a big consequence. The user did offer a cousin as a replacement to avoid financial loss, which is considerate, but the sister isn't accepting that.\n\nAnother angle: weddings are the couple's event, so they should have control over the guest list. Plus ones are usually discretionary. If the sister isn't bringing a partner, maybe the user is within his rights to rescind. But the sister's attendance is also in question now. Is the user overstepping by making her choice about her attendance dependent on his decision?\n\nAlso, the timing is last minute, which adds stress. Maybe the user should have communicated better earlier. But he did adjust by offering the cousin. The sister's being in a 6-month relationship\u2014maybe not a long-term commitment, so the user could argue it's not too late. However, relationships can be significant even if short.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user's concern is about comfort during the event. If the boyfriend's behavior would disrupt the wedding, exclusion might be justified. But is it the user's place to make that call about a family member's partner? It's a delicate balance between personal preference and family relations.\n\nPossible answers: Some might say the user is in the right because it's his wedding and he has the final say on guests. Others might argue that the sister's attendance is being penalized for his dislike of her boyfriend, which could be unfair, especially if the sister is attending as a family member.\n\nI think the key factors are the user's right to control the guest list and the sister's reaction. Since the user is the one paying and organizing, he has the authority. However, making the sister choose between her partner and the wedding is a tough spot. But if the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close family/friends, maybe the boyfriend isn't considered close enough. The fact that the user is replacing the plus one with a cousin suggests he's trying to be fair financially. \n\nSo, the user's decision is based on his comfort and the event's nature. The sister's reaction is an emotional response. Whether he's in the wrong depends on prioritizing personal comfort vs. family bonds. Since the user is within his rights to decide, he's likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
