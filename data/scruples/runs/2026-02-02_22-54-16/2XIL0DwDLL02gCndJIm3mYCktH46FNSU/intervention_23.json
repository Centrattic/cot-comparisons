I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. The author is getting married and wants everyone at the wedding to be enjoyable, especially since it's an intimate event. The sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The original plus one was given because they liked the sister's ex-boyfriend. When they broke up, they decided to wait. Now the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author wants to exclude him, even though it's last-minute, and they found a replacement to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to control the guest list for their comfort. They might be justified in wanting to avoid someone who makes the event uncomfortable. Also, replacing the plus one with a cousin helps mitigate financial loss, so they're not being inconsiderate there.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is serious. She's threatening to not attend, which could create more problems. The relationship between siblings might be strained, and the author has to consider the potential fallout. However, the author's right to their own event and comfort is also valid. The sister is being asked to come without her partner, which is a common scenario, especially in destination weddings where the host manages the guest list.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's behavior. If he's problematic, it's reasonable to exclude him to ensure the wedding goes smoothly. The author isn't excluding the sister but the boyfriend, who is the plus one. The sister is still invited, just without her partner. That seems fair.\n\nBut maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister earlier, rather than rescinding it last minute. The timing could be a point against them. However, the author mentions they waited until the relationship was six months old, which might be a reasonable time frame to assess. Still, communication could have been better.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister might need to accept that not every plus one will be approved, especially if they are a burden on the wedding logistics or atmosphere. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting their event to be enjoyable for everyone present.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to manage their wedding guest list for their comfort, especially if the boyfriend is indeed problematic. The sister's reaction might be excessive, but the author's actions are within their rights. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
