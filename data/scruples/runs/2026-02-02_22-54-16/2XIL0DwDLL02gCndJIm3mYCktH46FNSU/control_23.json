I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author gave their sister a plus one previously because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, and the author's family members don't like him. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to attend the wedding unless the boyfriend can come.\n\nThe key points here: the wedding is intimate with close friends and family. The author wants everyone at the wedding to be someone they enjoy. The sister is being asked to come without her boyfriend, but she's pushing back. The author is worried about being in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider etiquette and family dynamics. Typically, guests of honor (the bride and groom) have control over the guest list. The sister is a plus one, but the author might feel responsible for the guest list, especially since it's their wedding. However, the sister is also family, and cutting off her plus one might affect her attendance. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is described as talkative, unemployed, and mooching. The author's family finds him unpleasant. But the sister is standing by him, which could indicate their relationship's strength. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the sister's, which could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, the wedding is their event, so they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nThe timing is last minute, which complicates things. The author tried to mitigate the cost by having the cousin take the spot, which is considerate. Still, rescinding a plus one after agreeing to it might be seen as unfair. However, the sister's threat to leave the wedding adds pressure. The author has to balance their own event needs against family relationships.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main consideration is intention and impact. The author's intention is to keep the wedding intimate and pleasant. The impact is that the sister might not attend, causing family strain. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author might be justified in their decision since the wedding is their event. However, the sister's reaction is also valid as she might feel disrespected. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since it's their wedding, they can control the guest list. The sister's threat is a consequence the author has to manage. The author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own event, but they might need to handle the sister's reaction diplomatically. So, answer B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
