I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is getting married and gave their sister a plus one. The sister had a previous boyfriend they liked, but now she's with a new guy who the author and their family don't like. The new guy is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and talks nonstop. The author decided to rescind the plus one and got a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the author wants only their closest friends and family. The sister's boyfriend is new, only 6 months in the relationship, and the author is uncomfortable having someone who they find difficult. The problem is whether rescinding the plus one was the right move.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set the tone for their wedding. If they don't want someone they dislike at their event, especially if it's supposed to be intimate, maybe they're justified. But on the other hand, the sister is being asked to exclude someone who's part of her life now, even if it's a recent relationship. The sister feels it's important for her to attend with her partner, so excluding him might make her feel disrespected, even if it's not the author's intention.\n\nThe author did try to mitigate the issue by getting a cousin to take the place, so there's no financial loss. But the sister is pushing back hard. The key points here are about respect for the sister's relationship and the author's right to control their event. There's also the timing\u2014last minute changes can cause stress, but they tried to handle it by replacing the plus one.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be prioritizing their comfort over their sister's current relationship, which is valid, but could also be seen as being inconsiderate. The sister's reaction might be extreme, but her feeling that she should bring her partner is understandable. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative) is a red flag, but the author isn't the one in a relationship with him; they just have to interact with him at the wedding.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't wrong if they feel their comfort is important, but they might have handled it differently. However, since the sister is choosing to exclude her boyfriend due to the author's decision, it's a conflict between two people's feelings. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the original plus one was given based on the previous boyfriend, and now the new one is problematic, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground, like having a conversation with the sister first before rescinding. Since they didn't mention talking to the sister first, maybe that's a flaw. But the answer options are only A or B. Given that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their wedding setting, even though it's causing tension with the sister. So answer B.\n"
