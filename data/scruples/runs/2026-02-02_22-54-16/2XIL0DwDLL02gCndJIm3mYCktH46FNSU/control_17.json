I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend at their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was given a plus one when she had a previous boyfriend, but now with a new one, the author doesn't want him to come. The reasons given are that the boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author is having a destination wedding and wants it to be intimate. They managed to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend is excluded, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on their guest list. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister's reaction is strong, but her boyfriend isn't part of the immediate family. The author might feel that the boyfriend, despite being a relative's partner, isn't fitting the wedding's vibe. On the other hand, excluding someone a sibling is close to can cause family rifts.\n\nI should think about cultural norms. In many cases, the bride and groom decide the guest list, and siblings can be on the list, but bringing a partner's significant other is a common practice. However, if the guest list is strictly curated for an intimate event, the author's reasoning might be valid. The fact that they found a replacement (the cousin) suggests they tried to be fair. The sister's threat to not attend is a big deal, but the author might prioritize their own comfort over the sister's presence. \n\nBut maybe the sister's boyfriend isn't a core part of the family, so the author's right to exclude him could be seen as valid. However, how the author approached it might matter. Was there communication? Did the author give a reason? The sister's reaction might be partly because of feeling disrespected. If the author's family was already aware of their dislike for the boyfriend before the decision, the sister might feel it was a power move. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend has been with the sister for six months. That's not a super long time, but some might say it's enough to be part of the family event. However, if the wedding is small and the boyfriend doesn't fit the vibe, the author's choice is understandable. \n\nIn the end, it's about personal boundaries. The author's right to have a wedding they're comfortable with versus the sister's feelings. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I have to weigh these factors. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because it's their event, but family can make it tricky. However, the sister's threat to not come shows the emotional impact. Still, the decision is the author's, so maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
