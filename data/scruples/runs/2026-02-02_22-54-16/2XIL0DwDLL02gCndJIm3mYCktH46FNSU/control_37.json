I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding. The key points here are the sister's new boyfriend, the reason for rescinding, and the sister's reaction.\n\nFirst, the original situation: the writer gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like. The writer doesn't want him there, rescinds the plus one, and finds a replacement (their cousin) to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening not to come unless the boyfriend is included.\n\nThe main issue is whether removing the plus one is justified. The writer wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The sister has only been with this guy for six months, so the relationship isn't super long-term.\n\nFrom a wedding planning perspective, guests are usually people the couple wants to celebrate with. If the presence of the boyfriend would cause discomfort, especially in an intimate setting, it's reasonable to reconsider. The writer isn't blocking the sister from attending but just the boyfriend. The sister's threat to not come at all is more extreme, but that's her choice.\n\nHowever, the sister might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. The boyfriend is her partner, and excluding him could be seen as controlling. But the writer is managing their own event and has the right to set boundaries. Since they found a replacement to avoid financial loss, they've tried to be fair.\n\nThe key factors here are the writer's right to manage their wedding guest list and the sister's reaction. The writer isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep their event comfortable. The sister's ultimatum is more about her own priorities, but the writer isn't obligated to accept that. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
