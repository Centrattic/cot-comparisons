I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother gave his sister a plus one originally when she was with her ex, which they liked. Now she's with a new boyfriend, and the immediate family members don't like him for various reasons: unemployed, mooching, talks too much. The brother decides to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute. The sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nThe main question is whether the brother is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the cultural norms around weddings. Typically, guests are limited, and sometimes family members get plus ones. But the brother is hosting a destination wedding, which is more expensive. The sister's boyfriend is only with her for six months, which some might see as a reason not to include him. However, the sister is now threatening to not attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nThe brother's reasoning is that he wants everyone at the wedding to be people he can enjoy, and it's an intimate setting. The sister's reaction is significant here\u2014she might not come at all. But does that make the brother wrong? Or is it within his right to set the guest list, especially for a destination wedding where costs are higher?\n\nAlso, maybe the brother tried to find a solution by getting a cousin to fill in so there's no financial loss. That's a point in his favor. On the flip side, the sister might feel that her personal life is being interfered with. \n\nBut in terms of fairness, the brother is the one paying for the wedding and organizing it. He might have the right to choose the guest list, even if it means cutting the sister's plus one. However, the sister might see this as disrespectful. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But in many cases, the host does have the authority to set the guest list. However, the fact that the sister is potentially skipping the wedding because of this is a problem. But the brother's intention was to have an intimate event with people he likes, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any etiquette that says you can't exclude someone's partner if they're with them, even if it's short-term. However, six months isn't that long, and in a destination wedding, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the brother could have communicated his concerns earlier to avoid a last-minute conflict. But since he did try to make it up by getting a cousin in place of the boyfriend, maybe that's a good effort. \n\nOverall, I think the answer leans towards B, but I need to be sure there's no cultural expectation that guests can bring a plus one regardless. But since it's a destination wedding, it's more about managing the guest list and costs. So, the brother is within his rights to decide, even if the sister is upset. Therefore, answer B.\n"
