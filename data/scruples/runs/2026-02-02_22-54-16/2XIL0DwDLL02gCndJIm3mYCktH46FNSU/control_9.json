I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author rescinded their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening to not come.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 27M, sister is 24F. They had initially given her a plus one when she was with her previous boyfriend, who they liked. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, mooches off her, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because they don't like him. They found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and might not attend without him. The author wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is making a personal choice about their wedding guests. They have the right to decide who attends their wedding, especially if it's supposed to be intimate. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) might be a valid concern for the author's comfort and the event's atmosphere. Also, they found a replacement to avoid financial issues, which shows they tried to be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being excluded based on the author's dislike of her partner. The sister might feel it's unfair since the relationship isn't that long (six months), and the boyfriend isn't the one who did anything to the author directly. The author's decision could strain the sister's relationship, especially if the sister is considering not attending. Family dynamics can be complex here. The author might be overstepping by making the sister choose between her partner and the wedding.\n\nBut the author's main point is about the wedding being intimate with people they enjoy. If the boyfriend's presence would make the event uncomfortable, then the decision is about their own comfort. However, it's also about respecting the sister's choice to bring her partner, even if the author dislikes him. There's a balance between personal preferences and respecting family autonomy.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about fairness and considering others' feelings. The author made a decision based on their preferences but it's affecting the sister's attendance. The sister's threat to leave might be an overreaction, but the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did try to mitigate the financial impact, which is a plus. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author might not be in the wrong because it's their wedding, but they should consider the relationship impact.\n"
