I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because of her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The brother is 27, getting married in April. They had given the sister a plus one before, when she was with her previous boyfriend. Now she's with a new guy who the immediate family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, mooches off her, and is very talkative. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, replacing it with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come unless her boyfriend is included, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nThe brother's reasoning is that he wants the wedding to be with close friends and family and not have someone he doesn't get along with there. The sister feels it's unfair to rescind the plus one now, especially since they've been dating six months. The user is asking if the brother is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Weddings are personal events, and the host often has the final say on guest lists. The brother's intention is to have an intimate gathering with people he's comfortable with. The sister had a prior plus one, but the new boyfriend doesn't meet that standard. The brother is replacing the spot with a cousin, so he's not cutting the sister entirely. \n\nBut maybe the issue is the timing. If the wedding is in April and this decision is made last minute, the sister might feel it's too late to change. Also, the sister might see the boyfriend as part of her life now, even if they've been together six months. The brother could be seen as being petty over a half-year relationship, but on the other hand, he's the one footing the bill and wants the event to be enjoyable.\n\nI think it's a common dilemma. The brother's right to have his preferences on the guest list might take precedence over the sister's relationship. But the sister's reaction is understandable because she might feel her personal life is being criticized. However, if the brother is the one hosting, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
