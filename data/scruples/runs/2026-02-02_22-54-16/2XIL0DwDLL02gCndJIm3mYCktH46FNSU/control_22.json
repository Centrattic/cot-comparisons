I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The sister's boyfriend is described as someone the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author decided to remove the plus one, found a replacement, and now the sister is threatening not to come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The author's reasoning is that they want an intimate setting with people they can enjoy. The sister was given a plus one originally, but after a breakup, it was open. Now the new boyfriend is problematic.\n\nThe key points: The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The author made a decision that affects the sister's guest list, which the sister is now contesting by threatening to skip the wedding. The author tried to mitigate financial loss by getting a cousin to replace the plus one.\n\nPossible angles: The author's right to control the guest list vs. the sister's right to attend with her partner. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe the author was too quick to rescind without discussing. However, the sister's boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern for the author's comfort. The timing is last minute, which might add stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The sister is an immediate family member, and the author might feel justified in not wanting someone disruptive. But the sister's threat to not come is a big consequence. However, the author did replace the guest, so financially it's covered. The main issue is the author's right to make this decision versus the sister's autonomy. In many cases, wedding planners advise against removing family, but sometimes it's necessary for the couple's peace of mind.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as they have a right to their guest list, especially if the boyfriend's presence would be uncomfortable for everyone. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions are within their rights.\n"
