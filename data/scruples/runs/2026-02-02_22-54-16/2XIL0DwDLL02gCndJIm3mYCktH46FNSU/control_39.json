I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author rescinded their sister's plus one for their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The author initially gave a plus one to the sister based on her previous partner, but after the breakup and a new boyfriend, they decided to cut the plus one. The sister is upset and threatening to not attend. The author managed to get a cousin to take the spot to avoid financial loss.\n\nPossible angles: The right to control guests at one's wedding. Is it reasonable to exclude someone from a wedding? How does the sister's threat affect the situation? Also, the timing\u2014last minute might complicate things. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative) is cited as a reason. But is it fair to judge someone based on those traits?\n\nThe author's main argument is about the intimacy of the event and wanting to enjoy everyone there. The sister's argument is that she should be allowed to bring her current partner. However, the sister has been going out for only six months. Maybe the author feels that the relationship isn't solid enough to be included in such a significant event.\n\nAnother point is that the author offered the cousin as a replacement, so there's no financial loss. That might mitigate some of the blame because they're trying to be considerate.\n\nBut is it wrong to rescind a plus one? Weddings are typically personal events where the hosts have final say over the guest list. The sister's boyfriend isn't a family member, so maybe the author is within their rights. However, the sister's reaction is to not attend, which could be seen as using an ultimatum over the plus one. That might be her being in the wrong as well.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. If the author feels that the boyfriend's presence would ruin the event for them, and they're willing to risk losing the sister's attendance over it, then perhaps they're not in the wrong. However, if cutting the plus one without a discussion causes the sister to not attend, does that make the author responsible for a strained relationship? It's a balance between personal comfort and family dynamics.\n\nI think the key here is the author's right to choose guests. Since it's their wedding, they can decide who to invite. The sister's threat is a separate issue, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that decision. They might have handled the communication better, but the decision itself is their prerogative. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
