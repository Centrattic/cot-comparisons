I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was given a plus one originally when she was with a previous partner. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The wedding is intended to be intimate with close friends and family. The author decided to remove the plus one, got a cousin to fill in to avoid extra costs, but the sister is now threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nThe main issue here is about the right to dictate who attends the wedding. Weddings are typically the couple's event, and they often have the final say on the guest list. The sister's plus one was a privilege, and if the guest is not desired, the couple can make that decision. However, there's also the consideration of the sister's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior and lifestyle might be valid concerns for the author. Unemployment and mooching could be seen as red flags, and the talkative nature might disrupt the event. But the sister's reaction is significant too. She might feel that her autonomy is being invaded, especially since they've only been dating six months. The sudden change could cause tension within the family.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to control the guest list against the sister's possible feelings of being excluded. In many cases, the wedding planners do have the authority over the guest list, especially for destination weddings where logistics and costs are a factor. The fact that they found a replacement (the cousin) to avoid financial loss shows they're trying to be considerate. However, the sister's threat to not attend is a serious consequence. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're managing their event as they see fit. But it's also possible that they could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by discussing it earlier or finding a compromise. Ultimately, the decision hinges on whether the author overstepped by removing the plus one, or if they're within their rights as the event hosts.\n"
