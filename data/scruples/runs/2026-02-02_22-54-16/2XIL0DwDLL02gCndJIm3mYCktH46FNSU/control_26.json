I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is getting married and had initially given their sister a plus one when her ex-boyfriend was still in the picture. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, and the person doesn't like him. The new boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very loud and talkative. The wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to take the spot. The sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't invited, and they've only been dating six months.\n\nNow, the key points here. Wedding guest lists are often a point of contention. The author wants an intimate wedding and doesn't want someone they dislike there. The sister is upset because she wants to bring her boyfriend. But the relationship is only six months old, which some might see as not long enough to expect a plus one. However, the sister might still feel entitled to bring someone, especially if the plus one was previously given.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they have the final say on their guest list. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts should be comfortable with everyone attending. However, rescinding a plus one last minute could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is upset. The author did try to find a replacement to avoid financial loss, which is a good point in their favor. But the sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening not to attend could be an overreaction, but it's her choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is questionable. Being unemployed and mooching off the partner is a red flag, and the author's discomfort is understandable. The loudness is another issue that could disrupt the event. The author's intention was to have a close-knit group, so excluding someone who they find problematic makes sense.\n\nBut is it in the author's right to make that decision without discussing it with the sister? Maybe not, but the sister's reaction is also important. The author may have handled the timing poorly, but the reasoning seems valid. The answer probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to set the guest list, especially for a destination wedding where they can control who's invited. The sister's threat to not come is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they don't get along with."
