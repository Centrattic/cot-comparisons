I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's boyfriend because they don't like him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The sister was given a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, but managed to get a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nNow, thinking about the norms around weddings. Typically, the wedding party sets the guest list, and family members can have plus ones, but there might be some flexibility. However, the author is the one getting married, so they have the final say over the guest list. The sister is an immediate family member, so including her is likely important, but the author wants to maintain an intimate setting with people they can get along with. \n\nBut there's a conflict here: the sister is now threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort and the wedding atmosphere over the sister's feelings. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her choice of partner should be respected, even if the family doesn't like him. \n\nIs the author wrong for rescinding the plus one? Well, if the wedding is supposed to be intimate and the author genuinely can't stand the boyfriend, it's their choice. But maybe there was a better way to handle it, like discussing the issue with the sister beforehand instead of rescinding at the last minute. Also, the sister's reaction is a valid concern. If she refuses to come, it could create a bigger family rift. \n\nHowever, the author did make an effort to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss, which shows some consideration. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a legitimate reason for the author's discomfort. The sister has been given a plus one before, but this time the new partner is problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding their own guest list, but maybe could have communicated better. The sister's threat to not attend might be an overreaction, but it's a real consequence. The key question is whether the author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wedding is their event, and they have the right to set the guest list. However, there's a nuance in how the decision was handled. But overall, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and the wedding's atmosphere.\n"
