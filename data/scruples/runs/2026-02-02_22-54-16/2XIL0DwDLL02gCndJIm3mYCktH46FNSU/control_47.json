I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, the wedding party, especially the bride and groom, have the final say on the guest list. It's their event, and they can choose who attends. The sister had a plus one initially, but after the breakup, the brother waited to see who she'd bring. When the new boyfriend came along, the family didn't like him. The brother decided to remove him, even though it's last minute, and found a replacement to avoid costs.\n\nThe sister is upset and might not come. The question is whether the brother is in the wrong. On one hand, the brother is trying to maintain an intimate setting with people he's comfortable with. On the other hand, the sister feels her partner should be included, which is a common expectation. However, the relationship is only six months old, which might be a factor in the brother's decision. \n\nBut weddings are personal, and the host's comfort is important. Even if the sister is upset, the brother isn't obligated to include someone he genuinely dislikes. The fact that they found a replacement to avoid financial loss shows consideration. The sister's threat to not attend is a consequence, but the brother isn't necessarily wrong in making his choice for his own event. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
