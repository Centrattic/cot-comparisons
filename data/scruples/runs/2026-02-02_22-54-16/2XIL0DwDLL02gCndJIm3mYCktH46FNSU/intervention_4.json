I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one because they don't like the new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't invited. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is the author's event, and they had a plus one for the sister initially. When the sister was with a previous boyfriend, they included him, but now with a new one who's unemployed, talkative, and seems to mooch off her, the author is cutting the plus one. The author managed to get another plus one (their cousin) to avoid financial loss, but the sister is upset.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to set the guest list and the sister's reaction. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say. The author's reasoning is about maintaining an intimate setting with people they enjoy. However, the sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on the context. If the plus one was a given right because of the sister, then removing it could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister feels it's a package deal. But if the wedding is designed to be intimate and the author has a valid reason (like the boyfriend being a poor fit for the event), then maybe not. The fact that they found a replacement might mitigate some of the issue, but the sister's reaction is still a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's boyfriend's behavior. If he's genuinely problematic, the author might be justified. But the sister might feel disrespected. The timing is also late, so it's a last-minute change. \n\nHmm. This is a tough call. The author has the right to their guest list, but cutting the sister's plus one might affect their relationship. The sister's threat adds pressure. However, the author's main concern is about their own comfort at the wedding. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to decide who attends their wedding. However, the sister's reaction complicates things. But the core issue is the author's right to control the event. So, B.\n"
