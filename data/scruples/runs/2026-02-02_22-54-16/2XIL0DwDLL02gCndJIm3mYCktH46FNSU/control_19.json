I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 27-year-old guy getting married in the Caribbean. They allowed their 24-year-old sister a plus one, initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. She's now with a new boyfriend who's 31, unemployed, and very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because they and their immediate family don't like him. They managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included. They've been dating for six months.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the author's right to have an intimate wedding and the sister's reaction. The author's main argument is that the wedding should only include close friends and family, and they don't want someone they don't get along with there. But the sister is upset because she wants to bring her partner, and if she can't, she might not come at all.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the wedding. Destination weddings are usually more exclusive, so the author might have a reason to be selective. The new boyfriend is described negatively: unemployed, mooching off the sister, and talkative. But is that enough to just rescind the plus one? The sister has a right to bring someone important to her, even if the family doesn't like him. However, the author is the one hosting and paying for the event, right? So they might have the authority to decide the guest list.\n\nBut there's a problem here: the sister is now threatening to not attend. The author is making a choice that could exclude their sister. Is it fair to exclude someone's partner if they are a significant other? Even if the author disagrees with the relationship, should they have that power? Maybe the author didn't consider that the sister's relationship status is her own business, and excluding her partner could be seen as overstepping, especially since they've only been going out for six months. Relationships can be new and important to the sister, so the author's decision might be causing a rift.\n\nWait, the author is rescinding the plus one, but the sister is using the boyfriend as her reason to come. If the author had allowed the plus one, the sister would come. Now, by taking away the plus one, he's potentially causing her to miss the event. That could be a problem. Also, the author says they designed it as an intimate setting, but maybe the sister's presence without the boyfriend is still acceptable. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's participation in a major family event.\n\nAnother angle: Is it last-minute? The author mentions it's last minute, but the cousin is filling in. Maybe the financial aspect isn't the main issue. The real conflict is the relationship between the author and the sister. If the author is making this decision based on personal dislike, even if the sister wants to bring someone, it could be seen as unfair. The sister might feel that the author is being judgmental about her new partner, which could lead to longer-term family issues beyond the wedding.\n\nBut then again, the author is the one who controls the guest list. They are the ones spending money, and they might feel it's their right to have people there they actually like. The boyfriend's behavior could be a valid concern for the event's atmosphere. However, the threat from the sister to not come is a significant consequence. The author needs to weigh the importance of maintaining family relations versus their personal preferences.\n\nI think the line in the sand is whether the author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. The boyfriend's issues are real, but the sister's potential absence is also a big deal. The author might be in the right to manage their own event, but maybe the way they handled it is where the issue is. Perhaps they should have had a conversation with their sister first before rescinding to understand her perspective and maybe compromise. However, the way it's presented, the author made the decision and found a replacement. The sister is now prioritizing her boyfriend over attending the wedding, which could be her choice.\n\nSo, if the author is simply changing the guest list to avoid someone they don't like and is causing their sister to leave, that's a problem. But if the sister is making the choice to exclude herself by not coming if the boyfriend isn't allowed, then the author isn't the one in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding the plus one. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the dynamics of their relationship. In some cases, family members are expected to be included, but in a destination wedding, space is limited. The author's reasoning is about intimacy, so maybe they are justified. However, the sister's threat is a reaction to that. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting someone they don't like, but perhaps they should consider the sister's feelings and find a solution that allows her to attend without the boyfriend. Alternatively, if the sister is using her boyfriend as leverage, that's on her. The author's answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. Since the author is the one organizing the wedding and has the right to decide who attends, and the sister is now choosing not to attend, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding the plus one. The sister's reaction might be the main issue here. The author isn't wrong for not wanting someone they don't like, but the sister's choice to prioritize the boyfriend over her sibling's wedding is problematic. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
