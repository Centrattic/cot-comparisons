I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves rescinding a plus one for the sister's boyfriend because the family doesn't like him.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author gave his sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex. After the breakup, the sister had a new boyfriend whom the family doesn't enjoy. The boyfriend is unemployed, seen as mooching, and very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a replacement (a cousin), and the sister is threatening to not attend if he's excluded.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's reasoning is about wanting an intimate setting with people they enjoy. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for hosts to have control over the guest list. However, the sister is now saying she won't come without her boyfriend, which complicates things.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set the guest list. But on the other, the sister is being penalized for the boyfriend's actions. The sister might feel that the decision is unfair, especially since the couple has only been dating six months. However, the author isn't rejecting the sister but the boyfriend. The problem is the boyfriend's behavior and situation, not the sister's choice to date someone.\n\nPotential issues: Is it fair to exclude someone based on a short-term partner? The author isn't excluding the sister, just the plus one. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe she's using that as leverage. However, the author did consider the financial aspect by replacing the guest, so that's a thoughtful move.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: Maybe they should have discussed it with the sister before cutting the plus one, but the sister's reaction is also extreme. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative) could be subjective, but if the family genuinely can't stand him, it's understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to maintain a comfortable environment for their wedding. While the sister's threat is a problem, the author isn't wrong for wanting to exclude someone they find difficult. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
