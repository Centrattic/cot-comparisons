I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The author is a 27-year-old guy, and the sister is 24. The wedding is in the Caribbean, and they had given the sister a plus one before because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now, the new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him there and has replaced him with a cousin to save money. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the one making the decision about the guest list, as it's their wedding. They have the right to decide who attends. However, the sister feels that her partner should be included since they've been dating for six months. The issue here is whether the author is overstepping by rescinding the plus one, especially when the sister is now threatening to not attend.\n\nWedding guest lists are personal, and the bride and groom (or in this case, the person's wedding) typically have the final say. The author's main argument is that they want everyone at the wedding to be agreeable, especially since it's an intimate event. The boyfriend's traits are problematic\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. However, the sister's reaction is significant; she's considering not attending if her partner isn't allowed. This creates a conflict between the author's preferences and the sister's feelings.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms and family dynamics. Siblings can have different perspectives. The author might feel it's their right to have a comfortable wedding, but the sister might see it as a personal slight. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for six months, which is a considerable time, and the sister might feel he's part of her life now. However, the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior are valid in terms of disrupting the event.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author mentions replacing the plus one with a cousin to avoid losing money, which shows they tried to be considerate of costs. But the sister's refusal to attend could lead to more significant emotional and family issues. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the sister's desire to bring someone she's close to.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for making decisions about their wedding. They have the right to curate the guest list. However, the sister's reaction is also a factor. The author might need to consider if the boyfriend is truly a problematic presence or if their dislike is personal. But given the description of the boyfriend's traits, the author's concerns are understandable. The sister's threat to not attend is a consequence of the author's decision, but the author's primary responsibility is to their own event.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the right to choose guests, the sister's threat, and the boyfriend's behavior\u2014it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
