I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is getting married, and their sister was given a plus one. The sister's new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and a non-stop talker. The author doesn't want him at the wedding, so they rescinded the plus one, offering a cousin instead to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening to not attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants opinions. The answer should be A or B. \n\nI should think about the norms around weddings and family dynamics. Typically, weddings are about the couple, and they have the right to set the guest list. However, there are social expectations and the importance of family relationships. The sister is a guest, but the plus one is an extra. The author might be within their rights to decide, but rescinding it so close to the wedding and causing the sister to not attend could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe boyfriend's traits are problematic, but the sister's reaction is also extreme. The author's intention is to have an intimate setting with close friends and family. The plus one was given to the sister, not the boyfriend, so the author might have the right to change it. However, the sister's threat to not come complicates things. \n\nIt's a balance between personal preferences and family relationships. The answer might depend on whether the author's decision is seen as reasonable. Since the wedding is the author's event, they might not be in the wrong. But causing a rift with a sibling could be seen as a mistake. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about making a good decision. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the focus is on whether the person did something wrong. The author didn't do anything illegal, but social norms are tricky. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to set their guest list, even if it causes family tension."
