I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The wedding is a destination event, which is likely more expensive and requires planning. The sister had a plus one initially, but when she started dating this new guy, the author decided not to include him. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, a moocher, and a talkative person that others don't enjoy. The author managed to get a cousin to take his place to avoid extra costs, but the sister is threatening to not attend if her boyfriend isn't there.\n\nThe key points here are about the guest list and the nature of a destination wedding. Destination weddings often have stricter guest lists because of the cost and effort involved. The author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family, which is a common reason for such weddings. The sister's boyfriend, being only six months in the relationship and not known by the immediate family, might not fit into that \"closest\" category.\n\nHowever, the sister is upset because she wants to bring her boyfriend. But the author's reasoning is that they want everyone at the wedding to be people they enjoy. The boyfriend's characteristics (unemployed, moocher, talkative) are red flags that could make the wedding less enjoyable. The author isn't excluding him because of something he did to them personally, but because of his behavior and how he might affect the event.\n\nThere's also the aspect of last-minute changes. The author did manage to get a replacement, so there's no financial loss, which shows they tried to be considerate. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant reaction, but the author's stance is about maintaining the integrity of their chosen guest list. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has a right to decide who attends their wedding, especially if it's a private event. The sister's boyfriend isn't a family member, and the relationship isn't long-standing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making that decision. The sister might be overreacting, but the author's actions are within their rights.\n"
