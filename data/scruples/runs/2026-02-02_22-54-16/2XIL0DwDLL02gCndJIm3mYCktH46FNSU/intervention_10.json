I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The author is a 27-year-old guy getting married, and the sister is 24. The sister's ex-boyfriend was previously the plus one, but after the breakup, she found a new guy. The author and their family don't like this new boyfriend\u2014unemployed, seems to mooch, and is a talkative person.\n\nThe author decided to rescind the plus one, which is last minute, but managed to get a cousin to take the spot instead. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed. The author believes the wedding should be intimate with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they dislike there.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author gave the sister a plus one initially because she had a previous boyfriend. After the breakup, the author was open to seeing who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is problematic, so the author rescinds the plus one. But the sister is now upset and threatening to not come. \n\nWeddings are personal events, and the couple typically has the final say on guest lists. The author might feel that the boyfriend's presence would disrupt the intimate setting they planned. However, rescinding a plus one especially when the relationship is relatively new (6 months) could be seen as a conflict between family members. The sister might feel that the boyfriend is now part of her life, and excluding him is a personal attack. \n\nThe author tried to mitigate the financial loss by replacing the plus one with a cousin, which is thoughtful. But the sister's reaction is also valid from her perspective. She might feel that her autonomy in bringing someone is being overruled. The key points here are the family dynamics, the timing, the reason for exclusion, and the potential impact on the wedding.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has the right to set the guest list for their wedding. However, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh, especially if it leads to the sister not attending. The sister's threat to not come adds another layer of conflict. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's relationship, which can be a tough call.\n\nBut in many cases, the wedding couple does have the final say on who attends. The new boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) could be valid concerns for the author. However, the duration of the relationship (6 months) might not be long enough to expect the author to accept him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to control their wedding guest list. The sister's reaction is understandable but perhaps an overreaction. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here about family relationships and how excluding someone might affect family bonds. But strictly from the perspective of the wedding owner's rights, the author is justified."
