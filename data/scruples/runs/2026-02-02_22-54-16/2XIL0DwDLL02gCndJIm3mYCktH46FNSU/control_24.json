I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who rescinded their sister's plus one is in the wrong. The scenario involves a destination wedding where the sister's new boyfriend is disliked by the family. The main points are the author's dislike of the boyfriend, the last-minute change, and the sister threatening not to come.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they want an intimate wedding with close friends and family. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author replaced the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and says she won't attend without her boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering etiquette and relationships. Weddings are personal events, and guests are usually chosen by the couple. However, family dynamics can complicate this. The sister has a plus one, which was given to her by the author. The boyfriend is new, and the family doesn't like him. The author wants to maintain a close-knit group.\n\nBut the sister is now threatening not to attend. The author might feel justified in wanting to avoid conflict and keep the wedding positive. However, cutting off the sister's attendance over a plus one could strain family ties. The sister's reaction is also valid because she's being asked to choose between her partner and the wedding, which is a significant family event.\n\nThe key factors here are: the author's right to decide guests, the sister's autonomy, and the impact on their relationship. While the author has the right to set the guest list, doing so at the expense of a close family member's presence is a big deal. The sister's reaction shows the potential harm to their relationship. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's feelings, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the timing is last minute, which adds to the sister's frustration. The author did find a replacement to save money, but that doesn't mitigate the stress and emotional impact on the sister. The boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern, but the sister has the right to bring someone she chooses, unless there were prior agreements otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasons are understandable, the decision to exclude the sister's plus one led to a major conflict. The sister's threat to miss the wedding indicates a serious rift. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but the way the situation was handled could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the answer depends on whether the sister's autonomy to bring her partner outweighs the author's preference for a certain guest list. Given the sister's strong reaction, the author's decision might not be justified, so they could be in the wrong.\n"
