I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author is getting married and initially gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talks too much, mooches off her. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because they want it to be intimate with close friends and family. They rescinded the plus one, replaced it with a cousin to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening to not come.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the guest list is usually the couple's choice. The author is trying to keep it close-knit. They did replace the plus one, so there's no financial loss. But the sister is upset because she's only been with the boyfriend for six months and feels he should come. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to decide the guest list. The boyfriend is new, and they have valid concerns about his behavior. On the other hand, the sister might feel disrespected or that the author is interfering in her relationship. The author isn't cutting off the sister entirely, just the boyfriend. Maybe the sister is overreacting, but it's a family issue. \n\nI think the author is within their rights to make this decision. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
