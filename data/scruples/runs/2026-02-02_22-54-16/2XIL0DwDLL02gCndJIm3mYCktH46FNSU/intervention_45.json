I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he isn't included, and they've been dating for six months.\n\nFirst, the brother gave the sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now the new guy is problematic: unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The brother wants to remove him to keep it intimate with close family and friends. They found a replacement (his cousin) to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not attend without the boyfriend. The question is whether the brother is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has some say over the guest list. The brother might feel that this guy doesn't fit the \"closest\" criteria. The boyfriend's behavior sounds like it could be a problem at the event. But the sister has the right to feel included. However, the brother isn't excluding the sister, just her boyfriend. It's about the plus one. The sister is choosing to make it a bigger issue by threatening to leave. \n\nOn one hand, the brother has the right to set the guest list since it's his wedding. He's trying to maintain an intimate atmosphere. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, mooching, dominating conversation) are legitimate concerns. On the other hand, the sister might feel disrespected, especially if the boyfriend is important to her. But the brother isn't excluding her; he's just removing the plus one. The sister could still attend alone or with someone else. If they found a replacement (their cousin), maybe the issue is more about the sister's reaction than the brother's decision. \n\nThe key points: The author is the one getting married, so he's in charge of the guest list. The boyfriend's behavior is genuinely problematic. The sister is threatening to not come, which seems extreme. The replacement was found to prevent financial loss. \n\nI think the brother isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his own event and the comfort of his close family. The sister needs to respect his choice and adjust accordingly. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
