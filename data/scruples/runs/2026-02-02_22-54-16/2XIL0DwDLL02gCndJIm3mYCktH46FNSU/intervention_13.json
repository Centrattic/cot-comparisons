I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old male getting married in April. He gave his 24-year-old sister a plus one to the destination wedding in the Caribbean because they liked her previous boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she would bring. Now, she has a new boyfriend, and the author and his immediate family don't like him. The boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and talks non-stop. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to attend the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed. The author wants an intimate setting with only close friends and family and believes he should enjoy everyone at the wedding. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are personal events where the couple can set the guest list as they see fit. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister is a family member, so her inclusion might be expected. But the author is the one hosting the wedding, so he has final say over the guest list, right?\n\nOn one hand, the author is within his rights to decide who attends his wedding. The sister's boyfriend was not there before, so maybe the plus one was a special accommodation. The author could have given the plus one to someone else, like the cousin, instead. However, rescinding the invitation at the last minute could be seen as causing stress, especially for the sister. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014she might feel hurt that her partner isn't allowed, which could affect her attendance.\n\nBut then again, the author is trying to maintain an intimate setting. If the boyfriend is truly disruptive and not part of the immediate family, the author might be justified in making that decision. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talking too much) could be legitimate concerns for a small, close-knit event. The author is also covering the costs, so it's a personal event, and he has the right to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, the sister is a family member, and excluding her partner might be seen as cutting her off, which could lead to her not attending at all. That's a significant consequence. Maybe the author should have addressed the issues with the sister first, like discussing the boyfriend's behavior, before making a unilateral decision. Rescinding the plus one without a discussion might come off as harsh, even if the author's reasoning is valid.\n\nAlso, the timing is important. If it's last minute, the sister might have already made plans or commitments with her boyfriend. The author did find a replacement (his cousin), which helps with the financial aspect, but it doesn't resolve the emotional aspect for the sister.\n\nIn terms of social norms, wedding guest lists are personal. The author isn't obligated to include anyone, even family friends or partners. However, the sister's potential absence is a big deal. The author's decision might be seen as inconsiderate, but if the boyfriend's presence truly disrupts the event's atmosphere, it's a tough call.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's right to control the guest list vs. the sister's feelings and the potential loss of her attendance. The author could be justified in wanting an intimate setting, but the way he handled it (without discussing with his sister) might be where he's in the wrong. Maybe a middle ground would be better, like setting boundaries with the boyfriend or having a conversation with the sister before cutting the plus one. But since the author did it, the sister's reaction is valid too. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If he had a valid reason and communicated it properly, maybe not. But since he didn't consider the sister's feelings and caused her to potentially miss the wedding, maybe he is in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
