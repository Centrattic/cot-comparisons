I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not included. The author is getting married in the Caribbean, and it's a destination wedding. They had given the sister a plus one before because she had a previous boyfriend, but now the new guy is problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is supposed to be an intimate event with close friends and family. The author wants everyone in attendance to be people they enjoy being around. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off the sister, and talkative. These are valid concerns for a family event where everyone's comfort matters.\n\nThe sister's reaction is to potentially not attend if her boyfriend can't come. That's a tough spot. The author is trying to balance their own comfort and that of their guests with their sister's feelings. The sister might feel that her partner is an important part of her life and should be included, especially since they've been dating six months. But the author might feel that the boyfriend's presence could disrupt the event.\n\nI should also think about the timing. It's last minute, but they managed to find a replacement for the plus one, so there's no financial loss. That's a good move by the author to mitigate the problem. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The author might be losing a sibling's presence at their wedding, which is a big deal.\n\nHowever, the author's right to set boundaries for their event is important. Weddings are personal, and the hosts often have the final say on who is invited. The sister's boyfriend doesn't meet the criteria of someone the family enjoys, so excluding him makes sense from the author's perspective. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic, so the author isn't acting out of spite but based on genuine discomfort.\n\nBut there's also the consideration of family relationships. The sister might feel disrespected or that her partner isn't being accepted. The author needs to weigh the importance of their sister attending versus excluding someone they find difficult. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author has already tried to find a solution by replacing the plus one.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to control their wedding guest list. However, the sister's feelings are valid too. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
