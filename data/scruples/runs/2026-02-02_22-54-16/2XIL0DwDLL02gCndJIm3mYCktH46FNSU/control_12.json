I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who's getting married in April. He's having a destination wedding in the Caribbean. They gave his sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, and the author and his immediate family don't like him. The guy is 31 and unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative, which is annoying. The author rescinded the plus one and found a cousin to replace the guest slot so no money is lost. The sister is now threatening to not come to the wedding unless her boyfriend is included. The author is asking if he's in the wrong because he wants the wedding to be intimate with only close friends and family.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The main issue is whether the author is justified in removing his sister's plus one. First, the sister's ex was welcomed, but the new boyfriend isn't. The author's reasons are that the new boyfriend is unemployed, mooching, and too talkative. The sister is upset and might not attend if her plus one is rescinded. The author is trying to maintain an intimate setting, so they were careful about guest list.\n\nI think the key points here are about the guest list and the timing. Weddings typically have a guest list that's decided in advance, and plus ones are usually given to someone who is part of the spouse's life. The sister's new boyfriend is a significant other, so excluding him might be seen as a personal attack on the sister. The author's reasons are subjective, though. Just because the family doesn't like the boyfriend's traits doesn't necessarily mean he's a bad person. But the author has the right to choose who's at his wedding, especially since it's a destination event where costs are high and space is limited.\n\nHowever, the sister has only been with the boyfriend for six months. Maybe the author is being too hasty. But he's made a decision. The problem is that by rescinding the plus one, the sister is now considering missing the wedding entirely. That complicates things because the author might be causing a rift just before his own wedding. But is that the sister's choice, or is the author's action the issue?\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. He has the right to set the guest list, and if the boyfriend is a bad fit for the event, it's reasonable. But there's also the aspect of family relationships. If the author is prioritizing his own comfort over his sister's feelings, maybe that's where the conflict arises. However, the main point is about the wedding being intimate. The author might argue that the plus one was given to the sister, but the current boyfriend is not the person they were expecting. Employability and being talkative are personal traits, but perhaps the author is justified in not wanting someone he and his family don't like. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions are within his rights. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
