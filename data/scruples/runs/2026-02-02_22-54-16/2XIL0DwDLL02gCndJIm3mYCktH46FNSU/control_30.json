I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about inviting a sister's plus one to the wedding. The sister had a previous boyfriend who was invited, but now she's with a new guy that the family doesn't like. The author rescinds the plus one because they don't like the boyfriend, and the sister is threatening to not come if he's not invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and guests usually have some control over their guest lists. The author mentions it's an intimate setting with close friends and family. If the boyfriend is a plus one, maybe they weren't invited in the first place. The author might feel uncomfortable having someone they don't like at their event. But the sister is upset because she wants to bring him.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's traits: unemployed at 31, mooching, and talkative. These are valid concerns for the author, especially if the wedding is supposed to be a pleasant experience. However, the sister is threatening not to attend, which complicates things. The author tried to find a solution by getting a cousin to take the spot, but the sister is still upset.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's their wedding, so they have the right to set the guest list. But they did rescind a plus one that was originally given. The sister might feel that the boyfriend's presence is important to her. The author's reasoning is about enjoyment and keeping it intimate. However, excluding someone's plus one can affect their willingness to attend. Maybe there's a middle ground? Like talking to the sister first before rescinding, but the author did try to handle it by replacing the plus one. \n\nThe key points are the guest list control versus the sister's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong because it's their event, but they should consider the relationship with their sister. However, based on the information given, the author's actions are within their rights. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
