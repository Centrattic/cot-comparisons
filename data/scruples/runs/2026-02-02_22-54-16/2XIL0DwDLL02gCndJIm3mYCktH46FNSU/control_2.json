I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother is 27, getting married in April. They gave the sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. When she got a new boyfriend, the immediate family doesn't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed, 31, and talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him, but the sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't there. They've been dating 6 months.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The wedding is intimate, only close family and friends. The author wants everyone there to be someone they enjoy. The sister feels entitled to bring her boyfriend even though they just started dating. \n\nI think the brother has a right to control the guest list, especially for a destination wedding where space and money are limited. The sister's boyfriend is described as problematic, and the brother is trying to maintain comfort for himself and his partner. However, cutting off the plus one at the last minute might be harsh, but the brother found a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014 threatening not to come is extreme.\n\nBut maybe the brother should have communicated better earlier. The sister might feel her autonomy is being taken away. However, the brother is the one paying for the wedding, so he has control over the guest list. The boyfriend's behavior could make the event uncomfortable for others. \n\nSo, considering the balance: the brother is not in the wrong (B) because he's managing his wedding's environment, especially if the boyfriend is a negative influence. The sister's threat is self-centered. The answer should be B.\n"
