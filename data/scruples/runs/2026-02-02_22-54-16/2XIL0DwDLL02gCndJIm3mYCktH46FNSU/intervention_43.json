I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (27M) is in the wrong for rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not attend, which is causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wedding etiquette. Typically, the wedding couple has the final say on who is invited. A destination wedding is usually more intimate, so it's reasonable for the couple to want to keep it to close friends and family. The sister was given a plus one previously with her ex, but now the new boyfriend is a problem. The guy is unemployed, seems to mooch, and is very talkative, which is bothering the author's family. \n\nThe author did try to make it up by getting a cousin to take the spot, so there's no financial loss. That's a good point because it shows consideration for the cost. But the sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend isn't included. The key factors here are the couple's right to choose their guests versus the sister's feelings and her relationship with the boyfriend. \n\nIf the wedding is meant to be intimate and the author is uncomfortable with the boyfriend's behavior, it's their event to manage. However, the sister might feel that her personal life is being judged, especially since they've only been dating six months. There's a balance between personal choice and family obligations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the wedding is their event, and they have the right to set the guest list. The sister's reaction is extreme, but it's possible to see both sides. The main issue is the boyfriend's characteristics making the event uncomfortable for the immediate family. The author handled the financial aspect, so that's a responsible move. \n\nBut maybe the sister is being reasonable in wanting to bring her partner. However, since the original plus one was conditional on the boyfriend being someone the family likes, the author could have kept it open and then decided later. But the author didn't specify that condition, so rescinding might be harsh. Wait, the original post says they gave the plus one when the sister had the old boyfriend and then decided to wait for the new one. But the author now wants to rescind because they don't like the new guy. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the right to adjust the guest list, especially for a destination wedding where space is limited. The sister's threat to not attend is a problem, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate everyone's feelings. The main point is the couple's comfort and the event's integrity. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding guests, and the boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern. The sister's reaction is her issue, but the author made a responsible decision by finding a replacement to avoid financial loss.\n"
