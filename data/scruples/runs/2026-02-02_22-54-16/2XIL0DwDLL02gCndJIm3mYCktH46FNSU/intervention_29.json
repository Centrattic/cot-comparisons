I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author gave the sister a plus one because they liked her previous boyfriend. When they broke up, they waited to see who the new one would be. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, mooches off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included. They've been dating six months.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about wanting an intimate wedding with close friends and family. They feel the boyfriend doesn't fit that. The sister is upset, maybe feeling disrespected or that her choice is being policed.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate. \n\nWedding etiquette usually allows guests to have a plus one, but there's no strict rule. The author might have felt it's their right to decide guests, especially since it's their wedding. But the sister is an invited guest, so rescinding her plus one could be seen as crossing a line. The sister might feel her autonomy is being invaded, especially if the author didn't discuss it with her first. The boyfriend's behavior is a problem, but is that the author's responsibility to address?\n\nOn the other hand, the author made a late change and found a replacement. Maybe they thought it's better to have the cousin instead. But the sister's reaction is significant\u2014threatening to not attend. That's a major consequence. \n\nPossible angles: The author may have overstepped by removing the plus one without discussion. The sister's boyfriend's behavior is a personal issue for her to handle. The author could have talked to the sister first, rather than unilaterally deciding. However, if the author's wedding is being disrupted, they might feel justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, family dynamics can be tricky. The answer often depends on communication and respect. If the author didn't discuss the decision with the sister first, that's a problem. But if they did and the sister still insisted, maybe it's different. Here, the author just says \"I have decided,\" implying no prior discussion. That's probably where the issue lies. The sister's right to bring someone (especially if they've been dating six months) vs. the author's right to control the guest list.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author replaced the plus one with a cousin might not matter if the sister feels the replacement isn't as valued. The main point is the sister's exclusion. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and made a unilateral decision, even if the boyfriend is problematic. The sister's threat to not attend shows how hurt she is, which suggests the author's action was hurtful. \n\nSo, answer A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and overstepped by removing the plus one without discussing it with their sister first.\n"
