I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The brother initially gave the sister a plus one because they liked her ex, but after a breakup, the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching, talks a lot. The brother doesn't want him there and replaced him with his cousin to save money. The sister refuses to come without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, should the brother be in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host has the right to set the guest list. The sister's plus one was a privilege, not a right. If the new boyfriend is causing discomfort for the host, it's reasonable to remove him. However, the sister's reaction is to skip the wedding, which is a serious response. \n\nBut the key points are: the brother acted to maintain the event's intimacy and his comfort. He found a replacement to cover costs, so it's not about money. The sister has been dating the boyfriend for six months, so it's not that short that the brother should have to accept someone he finds objectionable. The sister's attachment to her partner might be stronger than her commitment to the wedding. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother should have discussed this with the sister first, but he did give her a plus one originally and changed it when the relationship changed. It's his right to adjust the guest list. The sister's threat shows her prioritizing the boyfriend over family obligations. \n\nIn many similar situations, the host's comfort is paramount. The brother isn't being cruel; he's setting boundaries. The sister's reaction might be extreme, but that doesn't make the brother wrong. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
