I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is getting married and initially gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, the sister started dating someone new, and the author and their immediate family don't like this new guy. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative to the point of being disruptive. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take the spot to avoid financial loss, and now the sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if the boyfriend can't attend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, weddings are personal events, and the host has some control over the guest list. However, removing a plus one, especially last minute, can be seen as hurtful. The sister's threat to not attend suggests the decision might be causing significant family tension. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is about the wedding being intimate with close friends and family. The boyfriend's behavior and situation (unemployed, mooching) might make the author uncomfortable. But is it fair to exclude someone based on personal dislike, even if the sister is upset?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries for their wedding. On the other, excluding the sister's partner could be seen as being rude or causing family conflict. However, the sister being 24 and the relationship being six months might not be long enough for the author to feel obligated to include the boyfriend. Also, the author found a replacement, so there's no financial loss. \n\nThe key points are: the author's desire for an intimate wedding, the boyfriend's behavior being off-putting, and the sister's reaction. The author isn't being malicious but is prioritizing their own comfort. The sister's threat is a consequence, but it's her choice to act that way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on their preferences and found a solution. The sister's reaction is her own choice. Therefore, answer B.\n"
