I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules around wedding guest lists. Usually, the couple gets to decide who attends their wedding, especially if it's an intimate event as mentioned. The author gave his sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex, but after the breakup, they waited. Now, with the new boyfriend, they have issues. The boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. \n\nThe author is trying to maintain a small, close-knit group. They even managed to get a cousin to take the spot so there's no financial loss. But the sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't there. The question is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one.\n\nOn one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and they have the right to control the guest list. The boyfriend's behavior could make the wedding uncomfortable for the author and others. Also, the sister can still attend without the plus one. On the other hand, the sister might feel disrespected or excluded, especially since they had a previous plus one. The fact that the sister might not come could add pressure on the author, but maybe that's the sister's choice.\n\nBut is rescinding the plus one the author's right? If the wedding is private and the boyfriend is causing issues, it's understandable. However, the sister's reaction might be more about the principle of being cut off rather than the boyfriend specifically. The duration of the relationship is six months, but that's not necessarily short enough to make this a hasty decision. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to the guest list and the sister's right to bring someone. The author made a choice to exclude someone they don't like, which is their prerogative in their event. The sister's refusal to attend if her boyfriend isn't there is her decision, but the author isn't obligated to include people they dislike. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
