I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old male, is getting married and decided to take away their sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The sister originally had a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend, but now they don't like her new one. The new boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author tried to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is now refusing to attend without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, the main issue is about the author's right to control the guest list versus the sister's right to bring her partner. Weddings typically are the couple's event, and they usually have the final say on the guest list. However, family dynamics can complicate this. The sister's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening not to attend\u2014which might indicate that the issue is more about feeling disrespected rather than just the boyfriend's presence.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want everyone attending to be someone they enjoy, especially since it's a close-knit event. The boyfriend's behavior and situation (unemployed, mooching, talkative) are reasons for concern. But is it fair to rescind a plus one based on personal dislike of the boyfriend, especially after the sister had already been given a plus one?\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has been in a relationship for six months and might feel that her partner is part of her life, and excluding him could be seen as a personal attack. However, since the author is covering the costs (destination wedding) and it's their event, they might have the right to set boundaries.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In many cultures, the wedding couple controls the guest list. However, there can be exceptions when family members are involved. The author tried to be considerate by replacing the plus one to avoid financial loss, showing they wanted to manage the situation without extra cost. The sister's threat to not attend might be an overreaction, but the author's decision might be seen as harsh if the sister feels her relationship is valid.\n\nBut given that it's the author's wedding and the event's intimacy, the author's stance could be justified. The key is whether the decision is reasonable. The boyfriend's characteristics are a concern, and the author is prioritizing their own comfort for the event. The sister's reaction might not be fair, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong if they're in charge of the guest list.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong), as they have the right to manage their wedding guest list, even if the sister feels hurt. However, the author might need to communicate better to understand the sister's perspective, but the core issue is the author's right to set the guest list.\n"
