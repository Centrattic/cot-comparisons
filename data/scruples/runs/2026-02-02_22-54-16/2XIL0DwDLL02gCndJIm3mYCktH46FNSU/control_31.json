I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The sister's boyfriend is unemployed at 31, mooching off her, and very talkative. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. They decided to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is now threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nNow, I need to think about the ethics here. Invitations to a wedding are personal decisions. The author has the right to choose their guests, especially if they want an intimate event. However, the sister feels strongly about bringing her partner, which could affect the relationship between siblings.\n\nIs it fair to rescind a plus one last minute? The original plus one was given when the sister was with a previous boyfriend. Now that the relationship changed, the author might have the right to adjust the guest list. But the sister's reaction is also a factor. If her not attending would cause a rift, it's a tough call.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic. If the author has legitimate concerns about the guest affecting the event's atmosphere, that's a valid reason. But the sister might feel disrespected, and the timing is last minute, which could be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author made a compromise by replacing the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. That shows they tried to be fair. The sister's threat to not attend might be an overreaction, especially since they've only been dating six months. Maybe the sister is putting pressure on the author by using the wedding as leverage.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has the right to set boundaries for their own wedding. The sister's boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern for the author's comfort. So, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way the plus one was rescinded could be seen as abrupt, but the author had reasons.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to choose guests and the sister's overreaction. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their own event's comfort and made accommodations. The sister's reaction is causing conflict, but the author's decision is based on valid concerns.\n"
