I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is getting married, and originally gave their sister a plus one, which she used with her previous boyfriend. Now she has a new boyfriend, and the author and their immediate family don't like him\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talks too much. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace the slot to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening not to come to the wedding.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close family and friends, so they want everyone there to be enjoyable. The sister is upset because she's been with the boyfriend for six months and feels he should be included. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to set the guest list for their wedding, especially if they designed it to be intimate. They might feel that the boyfriend's presence would make the event uncomfortable. Also, they tried to mitigate the financial impact by replacing the plus one with a cousin, which shows they considered the cost.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being excluded from the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed. That's a significant consequence. The sister might feel that her personal relationship should be respected, even if the family doesn't approve. Six months is a reasonable time to have a plus one, depending on the family's usual practices. The author's decision might be seen as overstepping, especially if the sister's relationship is valid and the author's dislike is based on personal preferences rather than harmful behavior.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic. He's unemployed, mooching, and talkative. If those are true, maybe the author has valid concerns about the guest's conduct at a family event. However, the author's responsibility is to their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. The sister's threat to leave if the boyfriend can't come seems to put the author in a tough spot. The author might be right in prioritizing their own event, but it's also possible that the sister's feelings are valid, and the author didn't communicate well.\n\nAnother angle: The author initially allowed the sister a plus one. Changing that last-minute might be seen as unfair, especially if the sister expected to bring someone. The timing could be an issue. However, since they found a replacement, maybe the financial aspect isn't the problem here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and fairness. If the author acted in good faith to maintain their desired event and tried to find a solution, they might not be wrong. However, excluding someone from a wedding because they don't like them can be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is being punished for her relationship. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have the right to choose their guests, especially for an intimate wedding. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern, and the author made an effort to replace the plus one. The sister's threat is her own issue. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, but they're not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
