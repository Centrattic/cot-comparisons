I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. The sister was given a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now, the new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative, which the family doesn't like. The author decided to take away the plus one and found a cousin to replace it to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has some say over the guest list. The author's reasoning is about keeping the wedding intimate with close family and friends. However, the sister's new boyfriend is with her for only 6 months, which is a relatively short time. The original plus one was given to the sister, so the author might be within their rights to revoke it, especially if the guest list was agreed upon as close-knit.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the new boyfriend is being characterized. The author says the family doesn't enjoy him, he's unemployed, and talks a lot. These could be personal judgments. The sister might feel that the author is judging her new partner, which could lead to tension. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting their sister's autonomy, but also as reasonable to maintain the event's atmosphere.\n\nThe sister is threatening to not attend, which complicates things. If the sister is upset because her partner isn't allowed, maybe the author should have considered the impact on their sibling relationship. However, the author might feel that the wedding is their priority and that the guest list should be manageable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author did replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which is considerate. But the decision to rescind a plus one based on personal dislike might be seen as harsh, even if it's a destination wedding. The question is whether the author's reasons are valid enough to justify the action. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the plus one was an agreement that allowed for revocation. If the plus one was given with the condition that it's only for someone they approve, then the author might be justified. Otherwise, the sister might feel it's a breach of trust. Since the original plus one was based on the ex-boyfriend, and now the new partner is different, the author has a right to adjust the guest list. However, the sister's reaction is also a problem. Maybe the author should have communicated better or allowed the sister to make her own choices.\n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because wedding planners do have the right to set their guest list, especially for an intimate event. The sister's choice to bring someone the family doesn't like could have been a risk. The author's action to maintain the event's intimacy is reasonable, even if it caused a conflict. However, some might argue that the sister should be allowed to bring someone to support her, but since it's a destination and the plus one was rescinded, replacing it is a way to handle it. So probably the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for discussion. The final answer is B.\n"
