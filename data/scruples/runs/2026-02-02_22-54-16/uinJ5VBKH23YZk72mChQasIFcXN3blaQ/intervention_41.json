Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a strict no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye before. Now, after the new waitress reported the tip, the owners have decided to enforce the policy more strictly, requiring any tips to be turned into a common fund. The author is conflicted about whether to keep the tip they already received or split it with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though the owners previously didn't enforce it strictly, the new policy is clear that tips must be turned into a common fund. But the owners told the author they can keep the existing tip. So the question is, do they have an obligation to share it now, even if the policy is new and the owners allowed them to keep it?\n\nThe author's argument is that they are not rich, live in a studio apartment, and the holidays will make things harder. They don't want to be a terrible person but feel justified in keeping the tip. The waitress who reported them is now asking about it, but the owners have given the author a choice.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the policy was in place all along and the owners just didn't enforce it before, the author might be under a moral obligation to comply now. However, the owners explicitly gave them permission to keep the tip, even as they're tightening the policy moving forward. That seems like a key point. The owners might not want to penalize past actions, especially since they were lenient before. \n\nAlso, the tip was left by a customer who, despite the no-tipping rule, chose to give one. The author might feel that the customer's intent was to reward them personally, not the restaurant. But the restaurant's policy likely dictates that tips go to the establishment, even if they were collected informally. \n\nHowever, the owners' statement in the meeting says they can keep the $2,000 tip but won't be allowed in the future. This implies that the author is allowed to retain the past tip, which was given under the previous lenient policy. The new policy applies to future tips, not retroactively. \n\nSo, if the author is allowed to keep it, then they aren't in the wrong. But if the policy change is retroactive and the tip should be shared, then maybe they are. However, the owners didn't make it retroactive; they just said future tips must go into the common fund. The existing tip is covered under the previous understanding, and the owners have already given their approval to keep it. \n\nAnother angle: the other waiters might argue that all tips should be shared, but the new policy doesn't mention past tips. The author might be seen as in a grey area, but since the owners allowed them to keep it, the author isn't violating the new policy. \n\nSo, the author's decision to keep the tip is based on the owners' current stance and the need for personal financial stability. The waitress who reported them might be acting in the interest of fairness, but the owners have already decided that the author can keep it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
