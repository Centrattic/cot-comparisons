Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy. The base salary for the wait staff is higher than usual, so maybe they're supposed to earn their income through wages, not tips. But the owners are turning a blind eye, allowing tips to be kept as long as they're not reported. The author got a huge tip from a celebrity, $2k on an $8k bill. Then, a new waitress reports this, leading to a meeting where the owners enforce a strict no-tipping policy. Now, the author has to decide whether to keep the tip or split it with others, which would leave them with $150.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The restaurant had a policy, but the owners allowed tips to be kept if not reported. The author didn't know the policy was going to change. They got the tip before the new rules were enforced. The owners are now making it a common fund where tips must be shared. The author is being asked to share a tip they received under the previous, more lenient policy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant didn't enforce the policy before, maybe the author had a reasonable expectation that they could keep the tip. The owners changed the policy after the fact, which might be unfair. Also, the author is in a tough financial situation, living in a studio apartment and working hard. The new waitress reported the tip, leading to the policy change, so there's an element of betrayal there.\n\nEthically, if the restaurant is now enforcing a policy that contradicts their previous leniency, the author might not be at fault for keeping the tip they received under the old rules. The owners are the ones who changed the policy, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong by not sharing. However, others might argue that since there's a collective agreement to share tips, even if the policy was loose before, the author should contribute to the team now.\n\nBut the key point is that the owners allowed tips to be kept before. The author didn't know the policy was going to change. Forcing them to share after the fact could be seen as unfair. Also, the amount is significant for the author, and they might not have the means to share it without personal hardship. The waitress who reported them might have a different perspective, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
