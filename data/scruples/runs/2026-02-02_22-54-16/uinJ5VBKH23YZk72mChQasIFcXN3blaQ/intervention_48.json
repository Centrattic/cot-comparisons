Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a non-tipping policy. The owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, but now they're cracking down. The author received a $2,000 tip from an NBA player's party. Some new waitresses are upset, and the owner's response is that the author can keep it but future tips must be shared. The author is considering keeping the tip because they're not rich and need the money, but they're worried about being seen as a bad person.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and the owner's statement. The owners never explicitly said to share past tips, only that future ones have to be given to a common fund. The author got the tip before the policy change, and the owner now says it's up to them whether to keep it. So legally or by policy, there's no obligation to share the old tip. The other waiters might be upset, but unless the policy was clear from the start that all tips are to be pooled, the author isn't bound to share.\n\nAlso, the author is in a tough financial situation. They're not being greedy; they're just trying to keep a windfall that came before new rules. The new employees didn't get the benefit of the old policy, so it's unfair to expect the author to share now. Plus, the owner's response was to let them decide, so the author is within their rights to keep it.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural expectation in some workplaces to share tips, even if the policy isn't written. But in this case, the policy was non-existent until now. The owner's policy change happens after the fact, so the author isn't bound by that. The other waiters might feel it's unfair, but the author isn't in the wrong here. They followed the previous understanding, and now the rules are changing, but that doesn't retroactively require them to share past tips.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the owner's implicit permission to keep it, and the policy change is for the future. Sharing isn't required unless the policy was clear from the start, which it wasn't.\n"
