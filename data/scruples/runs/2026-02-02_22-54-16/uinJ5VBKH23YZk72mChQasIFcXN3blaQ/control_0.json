Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant that has a \"non-tipping\" policy. The base salary is higher than usual, and the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy about tips. The author received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer, and now the restaurant is enforcing a stricter policy. The owner says the author can keep the tip, but others are upset and want it shared. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nFirst, let me look at the restaurant's policies. The restaurant is non-tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author was allowed to keep tips in the past, and the new policy is that tips must go into a common fund. The owner told the author specifically that they can keep the $2,000 tip, even though future tips won't be allowed. So legally or according to the restaurant's policy, the author is allowed to keep this particular tip. The owner didn't force them to share it, so maybe there's no policy violation here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, though, the author is being asked to share with colleagues. The other waiters might feel it's unfair if the author keeps the tip when the policy now is that tips are shared. But the owner made a specific exception here. So maybe the author isn't obligated to share it because the owner approved. But maybe the author feels conflicted because they don't want to be seen as greedy or unfair to coworkers.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's policy changed after the tip was given. The author didn't know the policy would change, and the owner didn't hold them accountable for the past tip. So the author is in a gray area. They might not be in the wrong legally or by the restaurant's rules, but others might argue it's unfair. However, the owner's words seem to give the author the right to keep it, so the author isn't violating any new rules. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
