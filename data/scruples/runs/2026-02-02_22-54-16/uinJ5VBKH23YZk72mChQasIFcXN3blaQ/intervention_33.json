Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant is high-end with high base salaries, and there's a no-tipping policy. However, some customers still leave tips, and the owners have been ignoring it. Then a big tip of $2000 comes in, and the other waiters are upset because one waitress reported the situation, leading to a stricter policy. Now the author is being asked to either keep the tip or split it with others, but they're considering keeping it.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owners' stance, and the employees' expectations. The restaurant claims a no-tipping policy, but in practice, they've allowed tips before. The owners now say it's up to the author whether to keep the tip, but future tips will go into a common fund. The author is conflicted between their financial needs and potential guilt.\n\nI need to consider who owns the tip. In many places, if a restaurant has a no-tipping policy, the tips might legally belong to the employees, but if the policy is enforced, perhaps the restaurant expects tips to be part of their revenue. However, in this case, the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, which means they were aware but didn't enforce it. Now, they've changed the policy, but the author is being asked to share the tip from before the policy change. \n\nThe author received the tip under the previous, more lenient policy. If the owners allowed it before, the author might have a legitimate claim to keep it. However, the new policy now requires splitting tips in the future. The question is whether the author is obligated to share past tips from a time when the policy wasn't enforced. \n\nAlso, the waitress who reported the author might be acting out of a sense of fairness, wanting to share tips collected during the previous policy. But from the author's perspective, they followed the existing rules in place at the time. \n\nLegally, if the restaurant collects tips on behalf of the employees, even under a no-tipping policy, the tips might belong to the employees. But if the policy is that tips are part of a shared pool, then the author might have an obligation. However, the previous practice was different, and the owners didn't enforce it. \n\nThe author is in a tricky spot. They might not be in the wrong if the tip was received under a policy that allowed it, even if the policy later changed. Plus, the owners gave them the choice to keep it. So the author's decision to keep it might be justified, especially given their financial situation. \n\nBut some might argue that once the policy changed, they should share past tips as part of the new system. However, the timeline is important. The tip was given before the policy was enforced. The owners didn't enforce sharing in the past, so the author might have a reasonable expectation that they could keep it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They followed the rules in place when they received the tip, and the new policy doesn't apply retroactively. The owners allowed it before, so they can't now enforce sharing for past tips unless they had a clear policy. Since the owners gave the choice, the author isn't wrong to keep it.\n"
