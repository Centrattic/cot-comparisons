Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. Let me break this down.\n\nThe restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye. The author received a $2000 tip from a high-profile customer. The owner's response now is that they can choose to keep it, but future tips must be shared. The author is considering keeping it all.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and the existing practices. The owners didn't enforce the policy before, so there's some ambiguity. Now they're changing the policy, but the author is being asked to share this specific tip. Since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe it's up to the author. But others might argue that if the policy is now strict, past actions should be addressed. However, the author wasn't aware that they had to share it before. The waitress who reported it started the issue. The author is in a tough spot, between personal financial need and fairness. Since the owners gave them the choice, maybe they're not wrong to keep it. Also, the restaurant's inconsistency in policy enforcement plays a role. The author isn't violating any current rule by keeping it, as per the owners' statement. So, probably answer B.\n"
