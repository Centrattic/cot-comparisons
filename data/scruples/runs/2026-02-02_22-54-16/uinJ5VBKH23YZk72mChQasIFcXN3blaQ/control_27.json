Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye. The author received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer. Other waiters are upset, and after a meeting, the owners decided to enforce the policy strictly. The author is now faced with keeping the tip or sharing it, but they don't want to share because they're not rich and need the money, especially with holidays coming.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The ethical aspect here revolves around fairness and the restaurant's policy. The policy was non-existent before, but now it's being enforced. The owner allows the author to keep the tip, but others might expect sharing since the policy is now strict. However, the author didn't know it was against the policy when they received it. Also, the other staff might not have reported their own tips if they had any. \n\nThe author might argue that since the owners allowed them to keep it, they're following the given direction. Others might say that in a team-based role like waiting, tips should be shared. But the policy was ambiguous until recently. The key factors are the restaurant's new policy and the owner's explicit statement allowing the author to keep it. If the owner said it's okay, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author knew they should share but chose not to, that's different. But the owner's decision to let them keep it seems to absolve them. \n\nSo considering the owner's stance and the ambiguity of prior policy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
