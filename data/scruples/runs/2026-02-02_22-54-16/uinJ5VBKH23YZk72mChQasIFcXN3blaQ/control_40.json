Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye in the past. Now they're enforcing a stricter policy. The author got a $2K tip from an NBA player, and the owner says they can keep it but future tips must go into a common fund. The other waitress reported the tip, and others are now upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The restaurant has a strict non-tipping policy, but there was some ambiguity before. \n2. The owners now say that any future tips must be shared, but past ones are up to the individual. \n3. The author is being asked to share this specific $2K tip, which would leave them with only $150. \n4. The author is in a financial situation where they need the money, especially with holidays coming up. \n\nThe other waitress reported the tip, leading to the meeting and new policy. The owners gave the author the choice to keep it or share it. The author is torn between keeping the money (which they really need) and sharing it (to avoid being seen as selfish).\n\nConsidering the new policy applies to future tips, not past ones, the author's decision to keep the tip is within the bounds set by the owners. The owners allowed them to keep it, so legally or according to the restaurant's policy, they aren't in the wrong. However, morally, there might be a question about fairness to other waiters, but since the tip was given under the previous, more lenient policy, and the owners didn't enforce sharing in this case, the author isn't obligated to share. \n\nAlso, the author's financial situation adds context. They're not wealthy and need the money for holidays. The waitress who reported them might have acted out of concern for fairness, but the owners' decision gives the author autonomy here. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong because the owners permitted them to keep the tip, and the new policy doesn't retroactively apply. The answer should be B (No).\n"
