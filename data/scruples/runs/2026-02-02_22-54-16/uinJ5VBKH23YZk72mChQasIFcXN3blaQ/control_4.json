Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The servers have a higher base salary, which is common in some upscale places. The owners have a don't-ask-don't-tell approach to tips left by customers, but now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, which a coworker reported. The owners told the author they could keep it, but future tips would be pooled. The author is considering keeping the money but feels conflicted.\n\nNow, the key points here. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but there's been a tacit acceptance in the past. The author kept the tip after being told they could, but others are upset because the new policy requires pooling tips. The author argues they aren't rich and need the money for holidays.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the restaurant allows the server to keep the tip, then the server isn't in the wrong. However, the social dynamics matter. The other waiters are upset because they have a system where tips are pooled. If the author kept the tip, they're not following the unspoken agreement others expected. Even though the owners said they could keep it, maybe there's an understanding that if tips are pooled, everyone shares. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the system for their own benefit, which could be seen as unfair to colleagues.\n\nAnother angle: the owners' policy now is strict, but the author received the tip before the policy was enforced. Since they were allowed to keep it, maybe they are within their rights. But the moral aspect is about fairness to others. If others are supposed to pool tips but the author is exempt, that creates inconsistency. The author might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the shared system that others rely on, even if the owners allowed it.\n\nAlso, the fact that others reported the tip suggests that there's an expectation of sharing. The author's decision to keep it could be seen as selfish, even if they're allowed to. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue that the owners' decision gives them the right, so B. But the social aspect is important here. The author might be violating the group's unspoken agreement, making them wrong. So I think A is the answer.\n"
