Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nThe restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author received a $2k tip from an NBA player, which is a significant amount. Then, after another waitress reported this, the owners decided to enforce the no-tipping policy strictly from now on. The author is now considering keeping the tip but might split it, leaving them with only $150 if they share. They're conflicted between needing the money and not wanting to be seen as bad.\n\nFirst, the policy was previously not enforced, but now it's strict. The owners said the existing tip can be kept, but future tips must be turned into a common fund. So the author is in a gray area here. They didn't know the policy was changing until after the fact. The other waitress reported them, which led to the policy change. The key point is whether the author is obligated to share the tip now.\n\nThe restaurant's policy wasn't clear when the tip was given. The owners allowed previous tips without enforcement. Now, they're changing the rules, which might not be fair. The author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip because the policy wasn't enforced at the time. They didn't know sharing was required. Plus, the waitress who reported them might be trying to get a share retroactively, which isn't fair. The owners gave the author the choice to keep it, so the author isn't obligated to share. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
