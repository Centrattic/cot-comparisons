Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy. Wait staff have higher base salaries. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach to tips, but now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author got a $2K tip from a customer who left $10K on an $8K bill. A coworker reported this, leading to a meeting where the owner said the author can keep the tip but future tips must go into a common fund. The author is considering keeping the money instead of sharing it, which would leave them with $150 if split.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for keeping it. The key points here are the existing policy, the owner's leniency, and the new strict policy. The owner's statement after the fact says it's up to the author to keep the tip. The author isn't being forced to share it, but they might feel pressured by coworkers or guilt.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owner allowed it in the past. Now they're changing it. The author received the tip under the old policy, so technically, they might be allowed to keep it. The owner didn't enforce sharing in this instance, so the author isn't violating a clear rule by keeping it. However, there's a social aspect\u2014other waiters might expect a share if they find out. But the owner didn't require sharing, so the author isn't obligated.\n\nMoral considerations: The author needs the money, especially for upcoming holidays. They're not a big shot; they're struggling. The coworker who reported them might be trying to enforce fairness, but the owner's decision allows the author to keep it. So the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the policy as it existed when they got the tip. The owner's leniency here means the author isn't obligated to share, even if others might expect it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
