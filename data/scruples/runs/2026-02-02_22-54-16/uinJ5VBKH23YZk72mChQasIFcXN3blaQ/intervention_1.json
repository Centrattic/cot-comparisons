Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a restaurant with a non-tipping policy. \n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye before. The author received a $2000 tip from a celebrity, kept it, and now others are upset. The owners decided to enforce the policy strictly after the incident, and the author is now being asked to share the tip.\n\nI need to consider the restaurant's policy and the employees' rights. Since it's a non-tipping policy, even if the owners didn't enforce it before, they now have a rule that tips must be turned into a common fund. The author was given the option to keep the tip, but the question is whether they should share it.\n\nIn many places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff unless there's a specific agreement. However, in this case, the restaurant's policy changed after the fact. The author might argue that they didn't know the policy was being enforced strictly until after the tip was given. But the owners did inform them that future tips must go into the fund. \n\nHowever, the author is being asked to share the tip they received before the policy change was announced. Since the owners gave the author a choice to keep it, the author's decision to keep it might be within their rights, especially if there's no prior agreement to share. The other waitresses are upset, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the policy wasn't clear before. \n\nAlso, considering the financial situation mentioned, the author's need to keep the money for holidays might be a valid reason. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
