Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant is high-end, with higher base salaries, and there's a don't-ask-don't-tell policy about tips. But now the owners are cracking down. The person got a $2k tip from a rich customer, and the other staff are upset. The owners said it's up to them whether to keep it or share it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the restaurant's policy, the previous leniency, and the sudden change. The person argues they worked hard for their money and need it for holidays. The other waitresses reported them, leading to a policy change. The owners gave them the choice to keep it or share.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the policy was previously not enforced, maybe the staff expected that. Now that the policy is being enforced, the person is in a bind. The owners are strict now, but allowed them to keep the tip. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for keeping it now that the policy is changing.\n\nLegally or ethically, if the restaurant has a policy against tips and the person is supposed to share, then keeping it might be against the new policy. But the owners gave them a choice. So maybe they're not in the wrong because the owners allowed them to keep it. The other staff are upset because they didn't get their share, but the person might not have an obligation if the owners said it's okay.\n\nAlso, the person's financial situation is mentioned, which adds context. They need the money. If the owners didn't force them to share, maybe the person has a right to keep it. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) aspect is about social norms. In some cultures, tips are pooled, but here, the policy is non-tipping, but the previous practice was different. The person might not be the asshole because the owners gave them the option. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
