Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with their fellow waiters. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The staff has a higher base salary, and the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author received a tip once, which the owners now say they have to decide if they want to keep it or share it. The author is considering keeping it, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the restaurant's policy and the social contract among the staff. The owners are enforcing a strict policy now, but previously allowed tips. The author got a tip under the old system. Now, the owners are saying it's up to the individual to decide, but the new rule is that tips must be shared.\n\nWait, the owners said that from now on, tips have to be turned into a common fund. But for the existing tip, they let the author decide. So the author is in a gray area. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to the policy change. The author now has to choose between keeping the tip or splitting it, which would leave them with $150. They argue they need the money, especially with holidays coming.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the restaurant's policy is clear now, but the tip was received before the policy was enforced. The owners are giving the author the choice. However, the other staff might feel that since the policy now requires sharing tips, the author should comply retroactively. But the owners didn't say that; they just said it's up to the author for that instance.\n\nEthically, the author might be seen as taking advantage of a loophole. But legally or by the restaurant's current rules, the author is allowed to keep it. The question is about moral wrongness, not legal. If the staff expects to share tips now, but the author didn't follow that in the past, maybe they are in the wrong for not sharing when others might have expected it. But the owners didn't enforce it until after the fact. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The author might be seen as selfish, but maybe not in the wrong if the owners allowed it once.\n"
