Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a waiter at a non-tipping restaurant who received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer and is considering keeping it instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The waiter got a tip, kept it, and now the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The other waiters found out, and the owner is asking if the author should share the tip. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for personal needs and not wanting to be seen as a bad person.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the different angles. The restaurant's policy is non-tipping, so by accepting the tip, the waiter may have violated the policy. However, the owners previously allowed it, so there might be some ambiguity. Now they're changing the policy, which complicates things. The author is being asked to share the tip, but they feel it's unfair given their financial situation.\n\nLegally, in some places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff unless it's a single server. If the restaurant is a non-tipping place, maybe they pool tips. However, in this case, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, so tips might not be supposed to be kept at all. But the owners allowed it in the past. Now they're changing the policy and want the tip to be turned into a common fund. The author got the tip before this change and is being asked to share it now.\n\nMoral perspective: The author might feel they earned the tip because they provided service to the NBA player. However, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, which could mean that tips aren't supposed to be given or kept. The fact that the owners allowed it previously but now are enforcing the rule adds a layer. The author might feel it's unfair to split the tip now, especially if they didn't know about the policy change in advance.\n\nAnother angle is fairness. If other waiters are also getting tips in the past, but this is the first time the policy is being enforced, maybe the author isn't the only one who kept tips. If others had kept tips before, it's inconsistent to now ask the author to share. But if the policy is now strict, maybe everyone should comply. However, the author is being singled out here.\n\nAlso, the financial situation of the author is a factor. They need the money for holidays and are in a studio apartment. That's a personal hardship. On the other hand, sharing could be seen as fair if the restaurant's policy is that tips should be pooled. But if the policy was non-tipping, maybe tips aren't supposed to be kept at all, so the author shouldn't have kept it in the first place.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The restaurant's policy is non-tipping, so tips shouldn't be accepted. 2) The owners allowed it before but now are enforcing the policy. 3) The author kept a tip before the policy change, and now they're asked to share. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping it now.\n\nIf the restaurant's policy was non-tipping, then technically, accepting tips was against the policy. Even if the owners were lenient before, the author still violated the policy by accepting the tip. Now that the policy is being enforced, the author should have to hand over the tip. If the policy is that tips go into a common fund, then the author should share it. However, the author might argue that they didn't know the policy was being enforced at the time they received the tip.\n\nBut the owners are now saying that even tips received before the policy change should be shared. That could be seen as unfair, but the author's own actions were in violation of the existing policy. So the author is at fault for accepting the tip in the first place, but the owners are now making a rule that any tips must be shared. The author's choice now is whether to comply or not.\n\nIn terms of morality, if the author kept the tip knowing that the restaurant's policy was non-tipping, they might be in the wrong. However, if they were allowed to keep tips in the past and the owners only changed the policy after the fact, the author might feel it's unfair. But the owners have the authority to change policies, even retroactively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they violated the restaurant's non-tipping policy by accepting the tip, and now that the policy is being enforced, they should share the tip as per the new rules. The fact that they didn't know about the policy change doesn't excuse the initial violation. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
