Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping a $2,000 tip from a customer at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a policy against tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. Now they're enforcing it strictly, and the author is being asked to share the tip or keep it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is key here. If the owners have a strict no-tipping policy, even if they previously ignored it, they're now enforcing it. The author received a tip before the policy change. The owners then said it's up to the author whether to keep it, but future tips will go into a common fund. So the author's decision is about a past tip, not a new one. \n\nThe other waitress reported the author, which might have led to the policy change. The author is now being asked to share the existing tip. The question is about whether keeping it is wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant has a policy that was enforced retroactively, the tip might belong to the restaurant. However, the owners said it's up to the author. Ethically, if the policy changed, maybe the tip should be shared. But the author might argue they didn't know the policy was being enforced retroactively. Also, the author is in a financial bind. \n\nThe owners' response gives the author a choice, so it's a bit ambiguous. If the policy is now strict, maybe the tip should be shared, but since the owners said it's up to the author, maybe they have discretion. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and the answer is B. The key points are the owners' ambiguity and the author's financial situation.\n"
