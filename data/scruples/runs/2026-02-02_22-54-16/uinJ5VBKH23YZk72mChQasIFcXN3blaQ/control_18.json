Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing a tip. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but they turned a blind eye before. Now, after a big tip incident, the owners are enforcing the policy strictly, and the question is whether the author should share the tip they already got.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before but are now enforcing it. So the author received the tip before the policy change. The owners told them they can keep it, but future tips must go to a common fund. The author is deciding whether to keep the $2k or share it, which would leave them with $150.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is obligated to share the tip now. The owners didn't force them to share it; they just said future tips must be pooled. Since the tip was given before the new policy, and the owners allowed them to keep it, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the waitress who reported it might expect fairness, but the owners didn't enforce sharing for past tips. The author's financial situation is also a factor\u2014they need the money for holidays.\n\nI think the key points are: the tip was received before the policy change, the owners allowed keeping it, and the new policy only affects future tips. So the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The answer should be B (No).\n"
