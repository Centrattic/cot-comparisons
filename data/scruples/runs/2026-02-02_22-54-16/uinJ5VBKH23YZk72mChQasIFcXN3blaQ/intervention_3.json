Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a tip from a high-profile customer at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip, but now after a policy meeting, they're told to either keep it or share it. The other waitress reported the tip, and the author is deciding whether to keep it or split it with others.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the arguments. On one hand, the policy wasn't enforced before, so maybe the author didn't have reason to share. The owners said it's up to them now. But maybe there's an unspoken expectation that tips should be shared among staff even if not written in policy. Also, the waitress who reported the tip might have done so to get a share herself.\n\nBut the owners' response was to allow the author to keep it. If the policy is now stricter, but the owners gave the author a choice, then keeping it might be permissible. The author's financial situation is mentioned, which adds context. They need the money for holidays, so it's a personal hardship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a non-tipping environment, tips might traditionally be pooled, even if not enforced. But the previous policy was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author didn't know they had to share before. Now the owners are changing the rules, but they gave them the option to keep it. So maybe the author is justified in keeping the tip. \n\nI think the key points are the owners' decision to let them keep it and the previous ambiguity in the policy. The author wasn't aware they had to turn it over before, so they didn't do anything wrong. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
