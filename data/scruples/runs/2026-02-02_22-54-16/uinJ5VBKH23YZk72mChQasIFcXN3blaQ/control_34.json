Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for keeping a $2000 tip when their restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they ignore it if tips are given, but now they're enforcing a stricter policy after someone reported the tip. The author is considering keeping the tip instead of sharing it, and people are debating whether that's right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners have a non-tipping rule, but they didn't enforce it in the past. Now, after the NBA player's tip, they're changing the policy. The author got a tip under the old policy, and now the new policy says tips must go into a common fund. The owner allowed the author to keep the existing tip, but if they receive future tips, they have to share. So the author isn't breaking the new policy by keeping the old tip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing the tip they already received under the previous, more lenient policy.\n\nNext, the author's situation: they're not wealthy, live in a studio apartment, and need the money for holidays. The waitress who reported them is now pushing for sharing, but the owners didn't force the author to share the existing tip. The owner gave them a choice to keep it or turn it in. So technically, the author isn't in violation of the new policy by keeping it. However, there's a moral aspect here\u2014should they share even if they can keep it?\n\nIn some restaurant environments, especially in places where tips are pooled, the expectation is that all tips are shared among staff. But in this case, the restaurant is non-tipping, so tipping isn't standard. The owners are now enforcing a system where any future tips are shared, but past tips are up to the individual. The author isn't required to share the tip they received before the policy change. \n\nThe key points are the policy's evolution and the owner's final decision to let the author keep the existing tip. Since the owner didn't force sharing, the author isn't in the wrong legally or by policy. However, morally, some might argue that fairness requires sharing, especially if others are following the new policy. But since the owner allowed it, the author isn't violating any rules. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
