Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip with fellow waiters. The restaurant is non-tipping, but the author got a $2k tip from a customer, and now the owners are enforcing a policy where tips have to be shared. The author is conflicted about keeping the money.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The restaurant didn't have a formal tip-sharing policy before, but now they're implementing one. The author received a tip under the old, more lenient policy. The owners say they can keep it, but future tips must be shared. The author is choosing to keep this one, big tip, which the new policy would have required sharing.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong to keep it now that the policy has changed. The owners are enforcing a new rule, but the tip was given under the old system. The author might argue that since the policy changed after the fact, they aren't obligated to share. However, the others might feel that since the new policy applies to future tips, the past ones should also be shared for fairness.\n\nBut wait, the owners allowed tips previously, even if informally. Now they're changing the rules. The author is in a gray area. The owners gave them the option to keep the existing tip, so the author isn't forced to share. However, some might argue that since the new policy is about fairness among staff, the author should voluntarily share to maintain team relations.\n\nLegally, in many places, tips are supposed to be shared among employees if that's part of the policy. But in this case, the policy wasn't clear, and the owners turned a blind eye. Now they're clarifying. The author might not be legally in the wrong because the policy was ambiguous before. But morally, there's an argument for sharing to be fair to others who might get similar tips in the future under the new policy.\n\nBut the key here is that the author's action was allowed under the previous policy. The owners didn't enforce sharing back then, so the author might not be obligated now. However, since the new policy is being enforced, the author might be seen as benefiting from an old rule that's no longer in place. But since the owners gave them a choice to keep it, it's their decision.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is bound by the new policy retroactively. If the owners said they can keep it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author shares the money for team harmony, that might be considered the right thing. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the owners allowed them to keep the tip, the author isn't violating any new rules. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
