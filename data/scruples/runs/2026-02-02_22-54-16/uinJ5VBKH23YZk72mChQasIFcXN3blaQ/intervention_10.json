Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but they have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author got a $2000 tip from a high-profile customer. The restaurant owners later changed the policy, making it strict and confiscating tips, but in this case, the author was allowed to keep the tip they already received. However, there's now a common fund for future tips. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the $2000 instead of sharing it.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the author's actions. Initially, the policy was lenient, so the author didn't know they had to share. After the policy changed, the owners told the author they could keep the existing tip. Other waiters might feel it's unfair, but the owners didn't enforce sharing for that specific instance. The author is in a tough spot financially, which adds context.\n\nLegally and according to the restaurant's new policy, the author was given a choice to keep the tip, so there's no obligation to share. However, morally, some might argue that tips are meant to be split among staff. But since the owners allowed it in this case, and the author didn't know the policy was going to change until after the fact, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The situation is more about the policy change and the owner's decision to let the author keep the existing tip. The author's financial need is another factor that supports their decision to keep it.\n"
