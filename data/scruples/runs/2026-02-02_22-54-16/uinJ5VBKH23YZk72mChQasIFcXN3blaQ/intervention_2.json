Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter keeping a tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is high-end with a higher base salary and a no-tipping policy. But some customers, especially celebrities, leave tips occasionally. The owners have been turning a blind eye before, but now after a complaint, they're enforcing the policy strictly. The key point here is that the restaurant's policy is against tipping, even if the owner hasn't always enforced it.\n\nThe author received a $2k tip from an NBA player. The waitress reported this, leading to a meeting where the owners decided to take tips more seriously. Now, the author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it, but if they share it, they get only $150. The author is considering keeping the tip because they need the money, especially with the holidays coming up.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, which is supposed to be enforced now. However, the owners said they could keep the tip, even though future tips will go into a common fund. So, the author is being given a choice, but the others are upset because they didn't know about this or perhaps expected the tip to be shared.\n\nI need to consider if the policy's enforcement is retroactive. The owner's statement that they can keep it but won't allow it in the future suggests that the policy change is not retroactive. The waitress who reported the tip might be trying to share it now, but the owner has given the author the option to keep it. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might feel that since the policy was not enforced before, they have a right to keep the tip. On the other hand, the waitress who reported them is following the new policy, which could lead to sharing. But the owner's response was to let the author decide, so maybe they aren't obligated to share. \n\nAlso, the author's personal situation (not rich, studio apartment, holidays) is a factor. The waitress who reported might have done so to enforce the new rule, but it's possible others expected a split. However, the owner's statement that it's up to the author to keep it implies that they aren't required to share. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the policy was not enforced retroactively. They were given a choice, and the owner didn't mandate sharing. The waitress's complaint might have been about future tips rather than the past one. The author's decision to keep the tip is a personal choice under the circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
