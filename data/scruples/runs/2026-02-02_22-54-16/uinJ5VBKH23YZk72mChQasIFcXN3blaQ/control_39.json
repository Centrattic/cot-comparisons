Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter keeping a large tip from an NBA player when the restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy but previously turned a blind eye. The owner now wants tips to be pooled, and the author is considering keeping the tip they already received.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The restaurant is high-end, staff has high base salaries, and there's a no-tipping policy. The owner didn't enforce it before, but after some complaints from new waitresses, they're cracking down. The NBA player left a $2k tip, and the author is deciding whether to keep it or share it. The owner says it's up to the author for past tips but future ones must be pooled.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping the tip. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant's policy is strict no-tipping, then taking the tip could be against the rules. However, the owner's response was to let the author decide about the past incident, implying some leniency. The owner is focusing on future compliance. \n\nEthically, there's a debate. If the restaurant's policy is to pool tips, then past tips might be considered part of a shared fund. However, since the owner didn't enforce it before and now only wants to change future actions, the author might feel it's unfair to be penalized for past actions. Also, the author is in a financial position where keeping the money is significant for them.\n\nAnother angle: the other waitresses complained, leading to the policy change. The author might feel that they should share to maintain good relations, but they're not legally or ethically obligated if the owner has already given them the option to keep it. The owner's statement that it's up to the author suggests they aren't in the wrong for past actions.\n\nHowever, if the policy was always meant to be enforced, then the author might have violated it, but since the owner didn't enforce it before, there's a gray area. The owner's decision to let the author keep it indicates that the owner isn't holding it against them. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author might not be, especially since the owner gave them the choice. The other waitresses might be upset, but the author isn't necessarily wrong if the owner allows it.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
