Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip with their fellow waiters. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The base salary is higher than usual, so maybe the owners intended for the servers to be paid fairly without tips. But there's a sort of unwritten policy where some customers still leave tips, and the owners turn a blind eye. The author received a $2,000 tip from a customer (an NBA player and friends), which is a significant amount. Then, after the owner's meeting, they were told that tips would be pooled or shared. The author is now faced with the decision to keep the tip or share.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy. The owners previously had a don't-ask-don't-tell approach, but now they're enforcing a strict no-tipping policy, even going as far as to require tips to be turned in. However, in this case, the owners told the author they can decide whether to keep the tip since it happened before the new rules were enforced. The other waiters are upset because they want the money shared, but the author is struggling financially and doesn't want to give up most of their tip.\n\nSo, the main question is: was the author in the wrong for keeping the tip? The owners allowed them to keep it, given the circumstances. The author wasn't aware that the new policy would retroactively affect this tip. The policy changed after the tip was given, so the author might not be responsible for the new rules. Also, the author is in a financial hardship, which could make their decision more understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have anticipated that the policy could change and that tips might need to be shared in the future. But since the owners explicitly gave them the choice to keep it, the author is following the guidance they received. The author isn't violating any current rules by keeping the tip, as the owners allowed it. The other servers' complaints are about fairness, but the author didn't create the situation; the policy shift was initiated by the owners.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the previous policy, and the owners gave them discretion. The financial need adds to the justification. So the answer should be B.\n"
