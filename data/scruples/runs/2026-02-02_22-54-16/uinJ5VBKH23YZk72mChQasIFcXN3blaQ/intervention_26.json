Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for keeping a $2,000 tip after a high-profile customer left it. The restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy but turned a blind eye before. Now, after someone reported the tip, the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly and want future tips shared, but this specific instance is up to the individual.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is obligated to share the tip. The key points here: the restaurant's policy was ambiguous before. The owners allowed tips but didn't enforce sharing. The employee got the tip under the old policy, and now the new policy is being enforced. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once the tip is received by the employee, it's typically their to keep unless there's a specific agreement or policy stating otherwise. However, the restaurant's new policy now requires sharing, but only for future tips. The author is being asked to retroactively comply with a new rule that didn't exist when the tip was given. That seems like a change in policy after the fact, which could be problematic. \n\nEthically, there's a gray area. The restaurant's policy was non-tipping, but they allowed employees to keep tips if they were given. By reporting the tip, the waitress may have felt it was unfair that others might also have tips and the new policy would require sharing. However, the author didn't know the policy would change, and the owners are allowing them to keep the existing tip. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the author is struggling and the tip is a significant amount. Sharing would leave them with only $150, which might be a hardship. If the policy wasn't clear, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it, especially since the owners didn't enforce sharing before. The new policy applies to future tips, so the author's decision is based on the circumstances at the time. \n\nIn many places, tips are considered the property of the employee unless there's a specific agreement to share. The restaurant's policy shift might not retroactively apply, so the author isn't obligated to share past tips. The fact that the owners are allowing the author to keep it suggests they acknowledge this. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip because they received it under the previous policy, and the new policy doesn't apply retroactively. They have the right to keep the tip they earned before the rule change.\n"
