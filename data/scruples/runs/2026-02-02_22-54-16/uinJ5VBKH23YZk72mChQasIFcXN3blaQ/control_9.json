Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a restaurant that claims to have a non-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a high base salary, so maybe the staff isn't supposed to rely on tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they ignore tips but don't encourage them. Then, the author got a $2,000 tip from an NBA player. Another waitress reported this, leading to a meeting where the owners decided to enforce the no-tipping policy more strictly. The owner told the author they can choose to keep the tip, but others might expect sharing. The author is conflicted between keeping the money for their own needs and sharing it.\n\nNow, the key points here: the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there's been some leniency. The owners now want to enforce it. The author got the tip before the new policy, so maybe they have a claim to keep it. However, the other staff might argue that tips should be shared as per typical restaurant practices, even if the policy says not to accept them. But since the owners allowed it in the past, the author might not be in the wrong for keeping it, especially if the new policy doesn't apply retroactively. \n\nAlso, the author is struggling financially, which adds context. The question is whether they should share despite the owners' statement that it's up to them. If the owners didn't enforce sharing before and only changed the policy after the fact, the author isn't necessarily wrong for keeping it. However, some might argue that in a team environment, tips should be shared. But since the policy was lax before, and the author acted within the previous understanding, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe the fact that they have a common fund now implies that any future tips should be shared, but the existing tip was before the policy change. The owner said it's up to the author to keep it, so they have permission. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
