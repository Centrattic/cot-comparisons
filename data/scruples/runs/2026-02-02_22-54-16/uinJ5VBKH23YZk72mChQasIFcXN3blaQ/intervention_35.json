Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received when the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a policy against tipping, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. So, if someone gives a tip, you're supposed to pretend it didn't happen. However, the narrator got a $2000 tip from a high-profile customer. Then, a new waitress reported this, leading to the owners changing the policy to enforce a stricter no-tipping rule. The owners told the narrator they could keep the tip but that future tips would go into a common fund. The narrator is now considering keeping the tip instead of sharing it, which would leave them with only $150 if they split it.\n\nSo the main points to consider here are the policy, the owners' response, and the narrator's decision. The restaurant's policy was clear: no tipping. But the owners previously allowed it with a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. Now, after the incident, they've changed the policy. The narrator is being asked to share the tip, but they feel it's unfair because they're not rich and live in a studio apartment, and holidays are coming up.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict between following the new policy and the narrator's personal need. The owners allowed the tip in the past, and now they're enforcing a new rule. The narrator wasn't told to turn over the tip at the time they received it. The owners even said it's up to the narrator to decide whether to keep it or not. So the narrator is in a position where they can choose to keep the money they were allowed to keep under the previous policy, even if the new policy is stricter.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of fairness among the staff. The other waiters might feel that if tips are going into a common fund now, then past tips should also be shared. But the owners didn't enforce that retroactively, only future tips. The narrator received the tip when the policy was more lenient, so they might not be required to share it now when the policy has changed.\n\nAlso, the narrator is in a difficult financial situation. If they share the tip, they would be left with very little, which could be a significant hardship. The owners gave them the choice, so keeping the tip could be seen as their decision based on their circumstances.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the owners' inconsistency. They allowed tips before but now want stricter enforcement. The narrator isn't at fault for receiving the tip under the previous policy. The new policy doesn't apply retroactively, so the narrator isn't violating any current rules by keeping the tip.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the narrator isn't necessarily in the wrong. The owners' change in policy and their own statement that the narrator can keep the tip suggest that there's no obligation to share. The narrator's decision is based on their personal financial needs, and the owners didn't enforce a retroactive sharing of previous tips. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
