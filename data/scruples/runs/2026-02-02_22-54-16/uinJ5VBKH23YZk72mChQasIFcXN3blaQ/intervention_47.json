Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about keeping a large tip in a non-tipping restaurant. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, meaning they ignore tips as long as they aren't reported. The author received a $2000 tip from a high-profile customer. Another waitress reported this, leading to a stricter policy where future tips must go into a common fund. Now the author is being asked to either keep the tip they already have or share it with others, but the author is considering keeping it all.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. Let's look at the restaurant's policy. Initially, there was no formal enforcement, so employees could keep tips if they weren't reported. The owners didn't enforce it until after the tip was given. The owners then said that future tips must be turned in, but for existing ones, it's up to the individual. So the author wasn't breaking any rules at the time they received the tip. \n\nThe new policy affects future tips, not past ones. The owners didn't explicitly require sharing the existing tip. The author is in a financial situation where they need the money, especially with upcoming holidays. The other waitress reported the tip, possibly to enforce the new policy, but the owners gave the author a choice. \n\nSince the policy change came after the tip was received and the owners allowed the author to keep it, the author isn't obligated to share. The other waiters might feel it's unfair, but the policy wasn't clear beforehand. Also, the author didn't know tips would be pooled, so expecting them to share now could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the existing policy at the time and the new rules don't retroactively apply to their situation. The decision to keep the tip is within their rights given the circumstances.\n"
