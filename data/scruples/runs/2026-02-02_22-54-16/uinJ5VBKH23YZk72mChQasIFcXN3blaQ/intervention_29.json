Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping a $2,000 tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. When a big tip was left, the author kept it, and now there's a new policy where tips have to be split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Since it was officially non-tipping but the owners allowed tips informally, there's a gray area. The author didn't know there was a strict policy until after the tip was given. The owners even said it's up to the author to keep the tip, which implies some level of acceptance retroactively. \n\nThen there's the new policy where future tips must be shared. The author received the tip before this policy was announced, so they weren't breaking any rules at the time. The new rule affects future actions, not past ones. \n\nFinancial need is another factor. The author is struggling, working hard, and the tip is a significant amount for them. Sharing would leave them with only $150, which isn't much considering the holidays are coming. The other waiters didn't necessarily contribute to the customer service in this case; the author was the one who served the table. \n\nThe person who reported the tip is part of the issue here. If the owners had a previous policy of not enforcing tip sharing and only changed it after the fact, the author isn't obligated to share retroactively. The owners' decision to let the author keep it suggests that even the management isn't holding them to a strict sharing rule in this specific instance.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the existing policy at the time and the owners allowed them to keep the tip. The new policy doesn't apply retroactively, so sharing isn't required. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
