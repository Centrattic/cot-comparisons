Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing their tip. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners have been turning a blind eye until a new waitress reported a tip the author received. Now the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly, and the author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it with others.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the restaurant's policy. The owner said they have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule before. Now, after the report, they're going stricter. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, and now the other waitress is asking about it. The owners told the author they can decide to keep it, but future tips must go into a common fund. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the $2000. The key points here are the policy changes and the fairness among staff. The author didn't know the policy was being enforced before, so maybe they were following the previous \"don't ask\" approach. Now, the policy is changing, so maybe the author is allowed to keep this one instance because it was before the new rules were announced. \n\nAlso, the waitress who reported it is the one pushing for sharing, but the owners gave the author the choice. The author is in a tough position because they need the money, especially for the holidays. The restaurant's policy now is that future tips go into a common fund, but this tip was before the new policy. So maybe the author isn't obligated to share it now. \n\nAnother angle is fairness. If the author keeps it, others might feel it's unfair, but since the previous policy allowed tips to be kept (even if not openly), and the new policy is about the future, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that once the policy is in place, even past tips should be shared if the new rules apply retroactively, but the owners didn't mention that. They said it's up to the author to decide, implying it's a past incident. \n\nSo the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the decision was left to them and the policy change is about the future, not retroactive.\n"
