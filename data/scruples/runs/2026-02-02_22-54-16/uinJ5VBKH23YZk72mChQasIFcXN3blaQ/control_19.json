Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a restaurant that has a non-tipping policy. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is clear: it's a non-tipping establishment, and the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. However, they're now enforcing a stricter policy where any tips must go into a common fund. The author received a $2,000 tip from a celebrity, and after being caught, the owners let them decide whether to keep it or share it, but future tips will be pooled.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy and the recent change. Before, the owners turned a blind eye, so there might have been an understanding that tips were for the individual. Now, with the new policy, the expectation is that all tips go into a shared fund. The author is being asked if they should share the tip they received before this policy was enforced.\n\nThe user is considering whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the tip. The owners gave them the choice to keep it, so there's no explicit rule forcing them to share past tips. However, there's a moral or ethical consideration about fairness to the other waiters, especially since the policy is changing to require sharing. The author is in a tough spot financially and might feel justified in keeping it, but others might see it as unfair.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant's policy never required sharing tips, the author isn't breaking any rules. But ethically, if the new policy is intended to ensure fairness moving forward, the author might be seen as taking advantage of the previous leniency. However, since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the situation is complicated by the fact that the waitress who reported them might have a different perspective, but the owners' decision to let the author choose suggests there's some flexibility. The author's financial need adds another layer, as they might need the money more than others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would hinge on whether the author is violating any explicit rules. Since the owners allowed them to keep the tip, the author isn't breaking a rule, but there's a moral debate. However, the options are A for yes (in the wrong) or B for no. Given that the owners gave them the choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
