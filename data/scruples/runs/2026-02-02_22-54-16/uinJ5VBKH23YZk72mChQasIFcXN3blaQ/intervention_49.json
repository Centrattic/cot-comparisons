Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with fellow waiters. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye before. Now they're enforcing it strictly, and the author is left with the dilemma of keeping the tip or sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners initially had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach but are now strict about the no-tipping rule. The author received a tip before this policy was enforced, so maybe they didn't know they had to report it. But the new policy says that any tips must go into a common fund. However, the owners let the author decide whether to keep the existing tip or share it. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially, with the holidays coming up. They're not a millionaire, just trying to make ends meet. The other waitstaff are upset, but the author didn't know the rules were changing until after the fact. The owner's decision was that it's up to the author to keep or share. So, the author's choice isn't against the new policy since it's already happened. \n\nThe key points here are the timing of the policy change and the owner's statement. The author didn't violate the policy when the tip was given, and the owners gave them the choice. The other waiters might feel it's unfair, but the author isn't the one who changed the policy. They're just following the owner's decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't break any rules before the policy changed, and the owners allowed them to keep the tip. The pressure from coworkers is there, but the author's financial situation is valid. So the answer would be B.\n"
