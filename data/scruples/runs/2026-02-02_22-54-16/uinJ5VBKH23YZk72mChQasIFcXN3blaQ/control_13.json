Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip from a celebrity customer, and now after a meeting, the owners are enforcing the policy strictly. The management told the author they can keep the tip they already received but not accept future ones. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the $2000 instead of sharing it with the other waiters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. It's a non-tipping establishment, so tips aren't supposed to be given or taken. However, the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they didn't actively enforce it before. Now, after the new waitress reported the tip, they changed the policy to strictly no tips, which the author had to comply with moving forward.\n\nThe key point is whether the author was explicitly told to share the tip. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the existing tip but not accept any more. There's no mention of the tip needing to be shared with others. The author isn't obligated to share unless the policy states otherwise. Since the policy was just enforced retroactively, and the management didn't require sharing, the author might not be in the wrong for keeping it. \n\nHowever, in some service industries, tips are considered part of a pooled system. But in this case, the restaurant isn't a tipping place, so even if there's a common fund, it's a new policy. The author got the tip before the strict enforcement, and since the owners allowed them to keep it, they might not have to share. The other waiters might feel entitled if they think tips are supposed to be shared, but the policy change comes after the fact. \n\nThe author's financial situation is also a factor. They mention struggling to make ends meet, especially around the holidays. If the tip was a significant financial relief for them, keeping it could be justified. The management's decision to let them keep it without sharing suggests that they aren't in the wrong. The other waitress reported the tip, which led to the policy change, but that doesn't necessarily obligate the author to share the money now. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong because the management allowed them to keep the tip they had already received, and there's no policy requiring sharing. The new policy applies to future tips, not past ones. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
