Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping a large tip they received, given the restaurant's non-tipping policy and the new sharing rules announced after the incident.\n\nFirst, the restaurant had a no-tipping policy but previously allowed tips without enforcing it. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, kept it, and now others are upset. The owners are now enforcing the policy strictly, and the author is deciding whether to share the tip with others.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the social norms around tipping. The owners turned a blind eye before, so there's an element of ambiguity. The author didn't know they had to share it until after the fact. Now that the policy is being enforced, the author is faced with a dilemma: keep the money they've already received or split it under the new rules.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant's policy was not clearly communicated or enforced before, the author might not be in the wrong for keeping the tip. The owners are now changing the policy, so retroactively requiring the author to share could be seen as unfair. Also, considering the author's financial situation, keeping the tip could be a personal choice given their need for the money, especially during holidays.\n\nHowever, from a social or ethical perspective, some might argue that since the restaurant is now enforcing a common fund, the author should comply. But the author wasn't aware of this requirement at the time of receiving the tip. The new policy applies moving forward, not retroactively. So the author isn't violating any existing policy when they received the tip. The new rule is about future actions, not past ones.\n\nAdditionally, the situation involves the restaurant owners' initial leniency. They could have enforced the policy from the start, but they didn't. Now, after the fact, they're making a new rule. The author isn't at fault for taking advantage of a policy that was informally in place until recently. \n\nThe other waitresses are upset, but the author didn't intentionally hide the tip or act fraudulently. The reporting led to the new policy, but the author's actions prior to that aren't malicious. The author is now choosing to keep the money they received before the policy changed, which isn't their fault.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip. They followed the informal policy that was in place and are now dealing with a new rule that applies to the future, not the past.\n"
