Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received in a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a strict no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author received a $2000 tip from a high-profile customer, and after the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly, the author is considering keeping the tip instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, but now they're enforcing a strict policy where tips must be turned into a common fund. However, in this case, the owners gave the author the option to keep the existing tip but to not accept any more in the future. \n\nSo, the author is faced with a choice: keep the tip they already received or split it. The key point here is what the owners said. If the owners allowed the author to keep the tip, then technically, they are not violating the new policy by doing so. The policy is about future tips, not past ones. The author didn't know beforehand that the policy would be enforced, so they might have acted in good faith.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their financial situation, living in a studio apartment and working hard. Keeping the tip would be a significant amount for them, especially with upcoming holidays. The other waiters are upset, but the author didn't have prior knowledge about sharing tips. The fact that the owners gave the option to keep it suggests that they might not expect sharing retroactively.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness. If the policy was clear from the start that tips would be shared, then the author would have a responsibility. But since the policy was recently enforced, and the owners allowed the author to keep the existing tip, it's more about the owners' decision. The author isn't necessarily at fault for not sharing something that the management permitted them to keep.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the owners gave them the choice to keep it. They're following the management's directive and have a right to the money they were allowed to retain. The other staff's complaints might stem from not knowing the prior policy or feeling it's unfair, but the author isn't responsible for past management decisions.\n"
