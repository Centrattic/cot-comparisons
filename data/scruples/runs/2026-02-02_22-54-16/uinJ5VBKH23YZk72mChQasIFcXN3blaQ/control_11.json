Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for keeping a tip when their restaurant has a no-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is high end with a base salary, and the policy is no tipping. However, the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer, but now the owners are cracking down and want tips to be shared. The author is considering keeping the tip, which the others might see as unfair.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the sudden change. The owners previously allowed tips to be kept if not reported, but now they're enforcing a strict policy where tips must be shared. The author is being asked to share the tip they received before the policy change, which they didn't know would be enforced. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? Well, the policy was inconsistent. Before, they didn't enforce sharing, so the author might have felt it was their to keep. However, now the policy has changed, and the owners are asking for compliance moving forward. The author didn't know the new policy at the time of receiving the tip. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong now for keeping the tip. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the new policy requires sharing all tips, even past ones, then the author might be expected to comply. But if the policy was only changed retroactively, that could be seen as unfair. The owners might have a point in wanting to enforce the new rule, but the author could argue they didn't know about the change when they received the tip. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is now enforcing a common fund, so even if the author kept the tip under the old policy, the new policy might require sharing. But the owners gave the author a choice to keep it or share. If the author chooses to keep it, others might see it as hypocritical since the policy is now strict. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. The owners' initial leniency allowed tips to be kept, but now they want to enforce sharing. The author's decision to keep the tip could be seen as taking advantage of the old policy. However, the sudden policy change might mean the author isn't at fault because they didn't know the rules would change. \n\nBut since the owners are now enforcing sharing, and the author was given the choice to share or keep it, the author's decision to keep it might be seen as selfish. The others might feel it's unfair if the author benefits from the old policy while others don't. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a grey area. The inconsistency in policy enforcement complicates things. However, since the owners are now strict and the author was given a choice, keeping the tip might be seen as wrong because they're not sharing when the new policy is in place. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
