Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for keeping a tip they received at a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant's owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy but are now cracking down. The author received a $2,000 tip from a celebrity, and the owners told them they can keep it but future tips must be split.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the tip. Let me break this down. The restaurant policy is no tipping, but there's been some ambiguity because the owners turned a blind eye before. The author kept the tip after the new policy, but the owners allowed them to keep this specific one since it's already happened. The author is considering whether to share it, but they're not obligated to now that the policy is changing.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy and the owners' decision. Since the owners told the author they can keep the tip, even though future ones must be split, the author isn't violating the new policy by keeping this one. The new policy applies going forward, but this tip was before the policy change in practice. The author isn't required to share it because the owners allowed them to keep it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But maybe there's an ethical consideration about fairness with the other waiters. However, the owners decided that this time it's okay. So legally or by policy, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's a different matter, but the question is whether they're in the wrong, which might depend on the policy. Since the owners let them keep it, the answer is B (No).\n"
