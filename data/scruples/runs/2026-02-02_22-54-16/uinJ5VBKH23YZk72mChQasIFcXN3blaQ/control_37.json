Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip they received when the restaurant has a \"non-tipping\" policy but previously had a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. The situation involves other waiters complaining now, and after a meeting, the owners are enforcing a stricter policy where tips have to go into a common fund. The author received the tip before the new policy was enforced, and now they're being asked to share it with others.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The restaurant's policy is \"non-tipping,\" but the owners turned a blind eye before. The author got a tip under the old system. Now, after the policy change, there's confusion about whether they should share past tips. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the existing tip, but future tips must go into the common fund. The other waiters are upset, and the author is considering keeping the money.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The original policy was non-tipping, but it was loosely enforced.\n2. The author received a tip under the old system.\n3. Now the policy is stricter, but the owner allows the author to decide about the existing tip.\n4. The author is in a financial situation where this tip is significant.\n5. The author might be seen as selfish for keeping the money, but they argue their financial need.\n\nI need to consider if there's an obligation to share the tip. Since the owners allowed the author to keep it, maybe there's no legal obligation. However, there's a social or moral expectation. The other waiters might feel it's unfair if someone keeps a tip under the old system when now it's shared. But since the author didn't know the tip would be shared before, and the owners gave them the choice, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The owners' statement that it's up to them suggests it's their decision. However, if the restaurant's policy change was in response to complaints about fairness, the author might be seen as holding onto something that others now expect to be shared. \n\nBut the tip was given before the policy changed. If the policy was always supposed to be non-tipping, but the owners allowed exceptions, the author might have a claim to keep it. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could depend on whether there's an implicit agreement among staff to share tips even under the old system, even though it wasn't enforced. If the other waiters started complaining and pushed for a policy change, maybe the author is now in a position where sharing would be the fair thing to do, even if not required.\n\nBut the owner's statement that it's up to the author to decide implies that there's no obligation. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. However, if the owner's policy change was to prevent future tips but the existing tip is a leftover from the old system, the author's decision to keep it might not be wrong. The other waiters might be upset, but legally or according to the owner's instructions, the author is allowed to keep it. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But if there's an unwritten rule among waiters to share tips regardless of the official policy, then maybe they are in the wrong. But since the owner didn't enforce sharing before, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The owner's choice to let them decide suggests they can keep it. So the answer is B.\n"
