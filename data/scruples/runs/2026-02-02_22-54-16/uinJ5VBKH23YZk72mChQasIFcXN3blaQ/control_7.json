Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a restaurant with a non-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy, but there's been a sort of unspoken understanding where some customers still leave tips, and the staff keeps them. The author received a large tip from a celebrity, which others found out about, leading the management to enforce a stricter policy. Now, the author is being asked to share it, but they're considering keeping it.\n\nSo, the key points are the restaurant's policy, the management's reaction, and the author's personal situation. The policy is clear now\u2014no tips allowed, and any tips must go into a common fund. However, the owners gave the author a choice to keep the tip from a past incident. The other waiters are upset because they didn't get a share. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, they were following previous practices until the policy changed. On the other, the new policy requires sharing. But since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe there's some leeway. The author's financial situation is mentioned, which adds to their hardship. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. Legally and according to the new policy, the tips should be shared. However, the owners didn't enforce it retroactively and gave the author an option. If the author keeps it, they might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, but if they share, they're left with very little. \n\nThe user's perspective is that they're not rich and need the money, especially with holidays coming. The dilemma is between personal need and fairness to others. The answer might depend on the restaurant's stated policy and whether the author was aware of it. Since the owners allowed them to keep it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But others might argue that once a policy is enforced, everyone should follow it, including past incidents. However, the owners gave the author a choice, which could imply it's acceptable to keep it. \n\nIn the end, the author might be justified in keeping the tip given the management's decision to let them choose, even if others are upset. The strict policy is for the future, but past actions are handled differently. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
