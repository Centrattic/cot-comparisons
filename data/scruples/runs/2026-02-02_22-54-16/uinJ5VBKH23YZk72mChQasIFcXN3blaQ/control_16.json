Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe restaurant is high-end with a \"non-tipping\" policy. The staff has a higher base salary, and usually, customers don't tip. But occasionally, some customers do leave tips, and the owners have been turning a blind eye. Then the author got a huge tip from an NBA player, which was reported to the owners. The owners now want to enforce the no-tipping policy strictly, and the author is faced with whether to keep the tip or share it with others.\n\nSo the key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owners' previous leniency, and the new enforcement. The author is being asked if they're at fault for not sharing the tip now that the policy is being enforced more strictly.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping. Even if the owners were lenient before, the new policy is clear: tips must be split. The author received a tip under the old, more lenient policy, but now the owners have changed the rules. The question is whether the author should honor the new policy and share the tip.\n\nThe owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it, but the other waitress reported the tip, leading to the policy change. The author is considering keeping it because they're not rich and need the money for holidays. But others might argue that since the policy is now strict, everyone should follow it, including past tips.\n\nHowever, the tip was given before the policy changed. The owners allowed the author to keep it, so there's ambiguity. The author isn't necessarily breaking the new rule by keeping it because it's in the past. But if the new policy requires sharing future tips, the author might be expected to comply moving forward. However, the original tip is a past event, so the author's decision to keep it isn't necessarily wrong if the owners allowed it.\n\nAnother angle: fairness. If others start getting tips now, they would have to share, but the author got to keep a past tip. That could be seen as unfair. But since the policy changed after the fact, the author might not be in the wrong for not sharing a tip received under the previous, more lenient terms.\n\nAlso, the owners said it's up to the author whether to keep it. They didn't force sharing. So the author's choice isn't against the new policy because the tip was already received. The owners are enforcing future compliance, not retroactively taking past tips.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they earned under the previous policy. The owners gave them the choice, and the new policy doesn't retroactively affect past tips. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
