Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a tip from a customer in a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy. The restaurant's owners have a don't-ask, don't-tell policy but now are enforcing a strict no-tipping rule, including a common fund for tips if given. The author got a $2000 tip from a celebrity, and after a meeting, they're deciding whether to keep it or share it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a policy where they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule before, but now they're changing it. The author received the tip before the policy change was announced. The owner said it's up to the author to keep it, but now future tips have to be shared. The author is conflicted because they're not rich and need the money, but also don't want to be seen as greedy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the policy enforcement timeline. Since the policy change was announced after the tip was given, the author received the tip under the old policy. However, the owner's statement implies that they expect the tip to be shared now. But the owner also said it's up to the author to decide. \n\nIn most restaurant industries, tips are considered the property of the restaurant, and employees are required to share them. However, the owner's previous policy was lenient. The author's decision might be influenced by the fact that the policy changed after the fact. Legally, if the restaurant allows tips, they must be shared. But here, the owner's stance is conflicting. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might be seen as taking advantage of a loophole if they keep the tip after the policy changed. However, since the tip was given before the new policy was enforced, and the owner didn't ask for it back, the author might argue they have a right to keep it. \n\nOn the other hand, the new policy is to share any tips given in the future, and the owner is expecting the author to comply. The author might be seen as not following the new policy, even if the tip was from before. But the owner's statement allows the author to keep it. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the policy change makes the tip part of the new shared fund. If the owner said it's up to the author, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the new policy implies that all past tips must be shared, then they might be. However, since the owner allowed the author to decide, the author isn't forced to share. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
