Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a waiter keeping a $2,000 tip from an NBA player despite the restaurant's non-tipping policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, but now they're enforcing the policy strictly. The question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the tip instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The restaurant is high-end with a base salary, so the employees are paid more than normal. The policy is no tipping, but some customers still leave tips. The owners didn't enforce it before, but now they are. The author got a large tip, someone reported it, and the owners said it's up to the author to keep it or share it. The author is considering keeping it for personal reasons, like needing money for holidays.\n\nThe main legal and ethical issues here are the restaurant's policies and the fairness of sharing. The policy was non-tipping, but the owners allowed exceptions before. Now they're strict. The author is in a bind because the owners didn't force him to share, but he's being asked in the AITA context if he's in the wrong. \n\nLegally, if the tip was given to the server directly and the restaurant doesn't have a policy for sharing tips, the server might be allowed to keep it. However, if the restaurant has a policy that all tips must be pooled, then the server is in the wrong. In this case, the restaurant is now enforcing that tips must go into a common fund, but the owner let the author decide. \n\nEthically, it's about fairness. Other staff might feel it's unfair if the author keeps the entire tip when others might not have had the same opportunity. The author is in a tough spot because the previous policy allowed tips, and the owner is now changing the policy. The author might feel that since the tip was given before the policy change, he's entitled to it. However, the new policy might mean that moving forward, tips are shared, but this one was an exception. \n\nAlso, the author is not rich and needs the money, which adds to the personal justification. But others might argue that the owner's statement that it's up to him implies that he could choose to share it. However, the owner didn't make it mandatory, so the author isn't obligated. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both legal and ethical angles. If the owner allowed it, then legally and under the current policy, the author is not in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area, but since the owner gave him the choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping it. The main point is that the owner didn't force him to share it, even though they're now enforcing the policy. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the owner gave him the option and the policy was previously more lenient.\n"
