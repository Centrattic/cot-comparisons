Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at a non-tipping restaurant where they have a high base salary. The restaurant's policy is no tipping, but some customers still leave tips. The owners kind of let it slide, like a don't ask, don't tell thing. Then the author gets a big tip from an NBA player and his friends, which is $2k. Later, the owner says they're going to enforce the no-tipping policy more strictly, and if someone gets a tip, they have to turn it into a common fund. The author is now being asked to share the $2k tip with the other waiters, but they're considering keeping it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The original policy was no tipping, but the owners turned a blind eye. So, when the author received the tip, the policy wasn't enforced yet. The owner's new policy is that tips must go into a common fund, but the author got the tip before this policy was announced. The owner even said that it's up to the author to decide what to do with it now.\n\nSo, the author's situation is a bit of a gray area. The tip was given before the strict policy was in place. The owners didn't enforce the policy at the time, so maybe they didn't expect it to be split. Now, they're changing the policy, but the author isn't bound by the new rules for tips they already received. \n\nAlso, the author is in a difficult financial situation, living in a studio apartment and working hard. The tip was a significant amount for them, especially with holidays coming up. They might need the money. The other waiters are upset because they didn't get a chance to get tips, but the restaurant's policy was non-tipping. The owner's new rule applies to the future, not the past. So the author might not be obligated to share the tip from before the policy change.\n\nMoreover, the owner allowed them to keep the tip, even though the new policy is in place. The owner's statement that it's up to the author to decide suggests that they have the freedom to keep the money. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the old policy. The main issue is that the restaurant's policy was inconsistent, and the author is now facing the consequences of a policy change after the fact. Since the tip was given before the policy was enforced, and the owner gave them the choice, the author's decision to keep the money is justified.\n"
