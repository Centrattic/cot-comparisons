Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye, allowing waiters to keep tips sometimes. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer, which is a significant amount. Now, after the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly, the other waiters are upset, and the author is being asked to share the tip.\n\nThe key points here are the existing policy and the owners' new stance. Initially, the owners didn't enforce the policy, so there might have been an understanding that tips could be kept. However, after the new policy, the owners are asking for tips to be turned into a common fund. The author is now in a position where they can choose to keep the tip or share it, but the owners left it up to them.\n\nThe question is about moral obligation. The author argues they're not rich and need the money for holidays. The other waiters might feel it's unfair if the author keeps it, especially since the policy was previously lenient. But since the owners now want all tips pooled, maybe the author should comply even if it's a hardship. However, the owners didn't force the author to share it; they just stated the new policy. The author's choice to keep it might be justified if they feel they were allowed to keep it before and the policy changed after the fact.\n\nAlso, the author might feel they were acting within the previous understanding. The new policy is retroactive, which could be unfair. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the policy changed, and they were given the choice. They didn't know beforehand that they had to share it. The owners' decision to let them keep it in this instance might mean the author isn't obligated to share unless they choose to. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
