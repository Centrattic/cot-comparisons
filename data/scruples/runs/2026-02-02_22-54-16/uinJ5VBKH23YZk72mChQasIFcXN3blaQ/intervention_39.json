Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners were previously turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip from a celebrity and kept it, but now the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The other waiters are upset, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong by keeping the tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The restaurant is non-tipping, so technically, the customer shouldn't have left a tip, and the staff shouldn't accept it. However, before, the owners were lenient, so there's a bit of ambiguity. The key point here is that the owners now have a new rule where any tips must go into a common fund. But the author received the tip before this new policy was announced. \n\nThe owners told the author that it's up to them whether to keep it or not. So, legally, since the tip was given before the new rule, the author isn't obligated to share it. But there's a social aspect here\u2014other waiters might expect sharing if it's a common practice. However, in this case, the owners didn't enforce sharing before, so the author might not have an obligation to share now. \n\nAlso, the author is in a financial situation where they need the money, especially with the holidays coming up. The amount is significant for them, and splitting it would leave them with very little. The question is whether keeping the tip is selfish or if it's reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nIn many restaurant settings, tips are shared among staff if it's part of the policy. But here, the policy was not enforced strictly until after the tip was given. The author might have a claim that since the tip was received under the old policy, they're entitled to keep it. \n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's policy changed after the fact. The owners are now strict, but the author's tip was before the new rules. So, the author might not be at fault for keeping it. The other staff members might feel upset because they didn't get the same leniency, but the author didn't do anything wrong under the previous policy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the tip was kept under the old policy and the owners' decision to let the author keep it. Since the owners said it's up to them, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the previous policy and are now facing a new rule they didn't agree to. The financial need adds to the justification. So, the answer should be B.\n"
