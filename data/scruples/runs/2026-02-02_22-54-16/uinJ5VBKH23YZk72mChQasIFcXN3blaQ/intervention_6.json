Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer, kept it, and now the other staff is upset because they found out. The owner said they can choose to keep it but future tips must be shared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. It's stated as a no-tipping policy, but the owners didn't enforce it strictly before. The author didn't know if sharing was required until after the incident. The new policy now requires turning tips into a common fund, but for past tips, the owner gives the author the choice. \n\nThe author argues they are not rich, live in a studio, and need the money for the holidays. They feel it's unfair to split the tip when the policy wasn't enforced before. The other waitress reported them, which might have been out of jealousy or wanting to enforce fairness now. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the policy was clear and the author was aware, maybe they should share. But the policy was ambiguous before\u2014owners didn't enforce it, so the author might not have known they had to split it. Now that the policy is stricter, they're allowed to keep past tips. The author is in a tough spot between their own financial needs and fairness to coworkers. \n\nI think the key points are the ambiguity of the previous policy and the owner's explicit statement that past tips can be kept. The author isn't in the wrong for following what was allowed then. The waitress reporting might have been trying to enforce a new rule, but the owner already gave the author a choice. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
