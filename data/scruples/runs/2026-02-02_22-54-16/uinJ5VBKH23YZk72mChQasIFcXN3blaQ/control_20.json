Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with fellow waiters at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye. The author received a tip from a customer, and now the owners are enforcing the policy more strictly. The author is being asked to either keep the tip or share it with others, getting only $150 after splitting. The author is considering keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. Legally, if the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, the employee might be expected to report tips as part of their income, but sharing with staff could be part of the policy. The restaurant's policy here is a bit murky. The owners initially allowed tips but now are enforcing a strict policy where tips must go into a common fund. The author was told they could keep the tip as it's in the past, but the new policy is for the future.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations come into play. If the restaurant's culture has been to not share tips, but now they're enforcing a new policy, the author received the tip under the old policy. The other waiters are upset because the author kept it, and there's a sense of fairness. However, the author is in a tough financial situation and might not be able to afford to split it.\n\nI need to consider if the author is bound by the new policy retroactively. The owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the past tip. So legally, the author might not have to share. But ethically, if the staff has a culture where tips are shared, maybe the author should. But in this case, the restaurant didn't have a clear policy before. The new policy is about the future, not the past. The author's action is under the old, more lenient policy. \n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's policy change might be to prevent similar situations. The author is in a position where they can choose to keep the tip since the owners allowed it. The others are upset because they didn't get the same opportunity. But the author didn't violate any new rules. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the policy was unclear and the owners allowed it before, the author isn't necessarily wrong for keeping it. The owners gave them the option to keep it. However, some might argue that in a tip-sharing environment, it's expected to share. But the restaurant was non-tipping, so tips weren't part of the usual compensation structure. \n\nIn many service industries, tips are considered the server's income, but in some places, they're pooled. But in this case, the restaurant had a no-tipping policy, so maybe tips were supposed to be declined. The author accepted a tip under the previous leniency. Now, the owners are enforcing a new policy, but the author's past action isn't against current rules. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip as the owners allowed it and the new policy doesn't retroactively apply. The financial pressure and the owners' statement that they can keep it support the author's decision.\n"
