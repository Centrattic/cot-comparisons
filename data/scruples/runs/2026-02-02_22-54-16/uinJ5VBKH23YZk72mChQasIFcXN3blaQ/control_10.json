Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with their fellow waiters.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The owners turned a blind eye before, but now they've become stricter. The author received a tip from a customer, which was reported, leading to a meeting. The owners said it's up to the author to decide whether to keep the tip or share it, but in the future, all tips must go into a common fund. The author is now considering keeping the entire amount, which would mean not sharing with others who might expect it. \n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the expectations of the staff. The owners allowed tips before but now have a new policy. The author is in a position where the owners gave them a choice, but the other waitresses are upset, especially since the reporting led to the policy change. The author is being asked if they're a terrible person for keeping the tip, but the owners didn't enforce sharing in the past, only in the future. \n\nThe ethical dilemma is about fairness and the new policy. The author might argue that since the owners didn't require sharing in the past and now are only enforcing a future policy, they can keep the tip. However, the other waiters might feel it's unfair since they also work there and the previous tips (if any) were shared. But in this case, the author received a tip under the new policy's grace period. The owners didn't force sharing, but the culture might have shifted. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author is expected to share past tips. Since the owners said it's up to the author, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But there's a social aspect. However, legally and according to the policy as stated, the author has the choice. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) aspect is subjective. In these threads, people often consider intent and fairness. The author didn't break any new rules, and the owners allowed them to keep it. So technically, they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that since the policy is now strict, the author should share to set a good example. However, the owners didn't make it mandatory, so the answer might be B (they're not in the wrong).\n"
