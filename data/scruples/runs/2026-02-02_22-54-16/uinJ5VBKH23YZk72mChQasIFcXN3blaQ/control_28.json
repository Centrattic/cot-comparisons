Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is a bit complex. The restaurant is high-end with a no-tipping policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners turned a blind eye before, but now they're enforcing the policy more strictly. The author got a $2K tip from a celebrity, and when the new waitress reported it, the owners said it's up to the author to decide whether to keep it or share. The author is considering keeping it but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policies. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, but now they're enforcing a strict no-tipping rule. The new rule requires any tips to go into a common fund. However, in this case, the owners allowed the author to decide. So, technically, the author is following the new policy by not keeping future tips, but the past tip is a gray area.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip. The main points are: the tip was given in violation of the policy, but the owners didn't penalize the author and allowed them to keep it. The other waiters are upset, so sharing the tip might be fair, but the author is struggling financially. \n\nLegally, in some places, tips belong to the individual unless pooled with the staff. But since the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, maybe the tips aren't supposed to be kept at all. However, the owners here are giving the author the choice. So there's no legal obligation to share unless the author is part of a tip-pooling arrangement. But since the restaurant is non-tipping, it's unclear if such a pooling exists. \n\nEthically, the author might feel they earned the tip and should keep it. However, others might argue that since the system is supposed to be non-tipping, sharing the tip would be fair. But the owners didn't enforce that in this case, leaving it to the author's discretion. \n\nGiven that the owners allowed the author to keep it, and there's no clear policy in place for past tips, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The financial need is a factor, and the owners' leniency in this specific instance supports the author's decision. However, if the author is part of a team where tips are traditionally shared, even if the policy says not to, there might be an unspoken expectation. But since the owners are now being strict and the author is following their guidance, there's no clear wrongdoing. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They followed the owners' instructions and kept the tip from before the new policy was strictly enforced.\n"
