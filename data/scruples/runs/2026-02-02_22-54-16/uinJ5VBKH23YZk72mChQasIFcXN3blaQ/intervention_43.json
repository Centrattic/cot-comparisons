Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a waiter who got a $2K tip in a restaurant that has a non-tipping policy. The owners were turning a blind eye before, but after some new waitresses complained, they made the policy stricter. Now, the author has this tip and the owners say they can choose to keep it or share it, but future tips will go to a common fund.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, meaning they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule strictly. The author was probably operating under that understanding. Then, when the policy changed, the owners allowed the author to keep the existing tip. So technically, the author wasn't breaking the new policy because it was allowed at the time they received the tip.\n\nAlso, the tip came from a high-profile customer who left it voluntarily. The author didn't ask for it, and the customer might not have known the policy. The owners even said it's up to the author whether to keep it. The new policy is about future tips, not past ones.\n\nThe author is struggling with whether to split the money. They mention their financial situation, needing the money for holidays. The other waitress reported the tip, but the owners handled it by letting the author decide. The key point is that the owners gave the author the choice, so there's no obligation to share it. The author isn't being asked to keep it; they have the autonomy to decide. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to share. If the owners allowed them to keep it, then the author isn't violating any rules. Plus, the new policy is about future tips, so the past tip is a different matter. The author isn't being a terrible person by keeping the money, especially since they need it. The other waiters might feel it's unfair, but the policy change was recent, and the owners didn't force sharing. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the previous policy, and the owners gave them permission to keep the tip. There's no rule requiring sharing now, so keeping it is acceptable.\n"
