Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye, allowing tips to be kept by the individual server. Then, a new waitress reports the author for taking a $2k tip from an NBA player. The owners then enforce a stricter policy, saying tips must go into a common fund if given. The author is now being asked to share the tip they already received, but they're considering keeping it.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip when the policy has changed retroactively. Let's consider the key points here. The original policy was a don't-ask-don't-tell approach. When the new waitress reported the author, the owners changed the policy, which might affect how the existing tip should be handled.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the policy hasn't been formalized into a contract, the restaurant could argue that the new policy applies moving forward. However, retroactively taking away something that was allowed previously could be problematic. The owners told the author they could keep the tip but not take new ones in the future. So the author isn't obligated to share past tips if they were allowed under the previous policy.\n\nEthically, though, there's a gray area. The new policy affects all staff, and if the author benefits from the old policy, others might see it as unfair. But the author was following the existing rules at the time. The waitress who reported them might have done so out of jealousy or to enforce the new policy, but the owners didn't penalize the author for past actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The policy change was after the fact, and the owners allowed the author to keep the tip. There's no indication the author had prior knowledge of a strict policy that required sharing. The decision to keep the money is a personal one, and while others might feel it's unfair, legally and based on the situation described, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
