Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant with a non-tipping policy. The restaurant's base salary is higher than usual, which probably means they're supposed to rely on that instead of tips. But occasionally, customers still leave tips, and the owners have been sort of ignoring it. Now, the author got a $2000 tip from a big customer, and some new waitresses are upset. After reporting, the owners decided to enforce the no-tipping policy more strictly, and there's a rule now that any tips have to go into a common fund. The author is being asked if they should split their recent tip with others, even though the owners said it's up to them whether to keep it or not.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, which is a business decision. The owners have the final say on their policies. Even though they had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, that doesn't mean the employees can keep tips when the policy is enforced. The author knew the policy but accepted the tip anyway. Now that the policy is being enforced, the owners are requiring tips to be shared. The author is given a choice to keep it or share, but maybe they should have shared it from the start because the policy was in place.\n\nHowever, the owners said after the fact that the author can keep it, which might be an exception because the tip was already given. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the tip when the new policy is now in place. The author is in a tough spot because they didn't know the policy was going to change until after they received the tip. The owners' decision to let them keep it might imply that they're not expected to share it. But the new policy requires future tips to be shared, so maybe the author is supposed to share this one too. \n\nBut the owners explicitly told the author they can keep it. So if the owners are okay with the author keeping it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Also, the author is in a difficult financial situation, which adds context. However, the other waiters might have expected that if they reported tips, the author would have to share. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were within the previous policy, even if the new policy changes things. Since the owners allowed them to keep it, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
