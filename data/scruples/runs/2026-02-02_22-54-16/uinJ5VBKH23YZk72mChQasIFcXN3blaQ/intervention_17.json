Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at a high-end restaurant with a no-tipping policy but the management has been turning a blind eye to people actually tipping. The author got a $2k tip from a customer, which they kept, and now the restaurant is cracking down after someone else reported it. The question is whether the author is at fault for keeping the tip instead of sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, which means they weren't enforcing the no-tipping rule strictly. So the author probably thought it was okay to keep the tip since others might have done it too. But now, with the new policy, they're supposed to turn tips into a common fund. However, the owners told the author they can choose to keep it, but others are upset because the author didn't share it.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The original policy was not strictly enforced, 2) The restaurant is now changing the policy, 3) The author was given a choice to keep the tip by the owners, and 4) The other waiters are upset because they want the tip split.\n\nThe author argues they're not in the wrong because they followed the previous policy and now the owners allowed them to keep it. The other waiters might feel it's unfair since they didn't get a tip in similar situations. But the restaurant's new policy might mean that future tips go to a common fund, but the author received the tip before that policy was enforced. So, the author might not be obligated to share it now, especially since the owners gave them the choice.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of fairness. If the previous policy allowed tips to be kept, and others didn't report each other, then maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if the new policy requires sharing, but the author was allowed to keep this one, then it's a bit of a gray area. The author's need for the money is understandable, and the restaurant's inconsistency in policy might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The restaurant's policy change after the fact and the owners' decision to let them keep it could mean the author isn't responsible for sharing with others now. The other waiters might be upset, but the author followed the rules as they were at the time. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
