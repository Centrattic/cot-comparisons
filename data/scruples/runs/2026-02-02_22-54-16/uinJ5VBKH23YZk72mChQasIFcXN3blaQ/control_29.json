Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style story is in the wrong for not sharing a tip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The staff has a higher base salary, and tips are supposed to be turned over. But there's a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author got a $2000 tip from a celebrity, kept it, and now others are upset. The owners said it's up to the author to keep it, but they're enforcing the policy now.\n\nThe key points here: the restaurant's policy is clear now, but before it was a bit ambiguous. The author got a tip under the old policy, and the owners are letting them keep it. The other waiters are upset because they might have to share tips under the new policy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip.\n\nI need to consider the policy changes. When the policy was ambiguous, the author might have thought it was okay to keep the tip. Now, the policy is strict, but the owners are allowing the author to keep the existing tip. So, since the tip was given before the policy change and the owners are explicit about letting the author keep it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Also, the tip was from a customer who insisted, so the author might have felt it was a gift specifically to them.\n\nHowever, the argument could be that the tip should be shared if the policy requires all tips to go to a common fund. But the owners said it's up to the author to keep it. So, the author isn't breaking any new rules. The other waiters are upset because they might have to share in the future, but in this case, the owners allowed the author to keep it. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the owners gave them the option to keep the tip. The policy is now stricter for the future, but the existing tip was allowed. The author's decision to keep it is within the bounds of the owners' decision. Plus, the tip was a significant amount and the author's financial situation is tight, so there's some empathy there. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
