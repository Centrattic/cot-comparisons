Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but sometimes customers leave tips anyway. The owners have been turning a blind eye, but now they're enforcing the policy more strictly. The author received a $2000 tip from a big customer, and the owner said they could keep it or share it, but future tips would be pooled. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting. The author is now conflicted about whether to keep the tip or split it, which would leave them with just $150.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's accurate. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners previously allowed tips to be kept. The author got a large tip before the new policy was enforced. The owner now says it's up to the author whether to keep it. The other waitress reported the tip, which led to the policy change. The author is struggling with whether to keep the money given their financial situation versus the potential guilt of not sharing.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the owners changed the rules after the fact. The author received the tip under the old, informal policy. The owners' decision to implement a stricter policy retroactively might be questionable. However, the author is now being asked to comply with the new rules, which include sharing future tips. But the owner is allowing the author to keep the existing tip, which suggests they have some leeway.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author is obligated to share the tip received under the old policy. Since the owners didn't enforce the policy before and allowed tips to be kept, the author might argue they were following the unspoken rules. However, now that the policy is enforced, there's a collective agreement to share future tips. But the $2000 tip is from before the policy change was announced. \n\nThe waitress who reported the tip might feel that the author is getting an unfair advantage by keeping it when others would have to share in the future. But the author's position is that they were following the previous arrangement and are in a tough financial spot. \n\nLegally, if the restaurant's policy prohibits tips, then accepting them might be against the terms of employment. However, if the owners didn't enforce it before, it's more of a moral or ethical issue. The author isn't actively violating the new policy by keeping the existing tip, as the owner is allowing that. So the author's choice to keep it is within the owner's discretion.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author could be seen as holding onto a windfall that others wouldn't get under the new system. But if the policy changed retroactively, the author isn't at fault for the change. The new waitress might be enforcing the policy now, but the author's actions were based on prior understanding.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the informal policy, and the owner is allowing them to keep the tip. The financial hardship is a valid reason to keep it. The waitress who reported might be enforcing the new policy, but the author's choice is within the owner's discretion. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
