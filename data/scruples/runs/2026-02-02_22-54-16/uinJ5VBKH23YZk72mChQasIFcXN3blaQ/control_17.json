Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a waiter who got a huge tip at a restaurant that claims to have a no-tipping policy. The restaurant owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they don't enforce it unless someone reports it. The waiter got a $2,000 tip from a celebrity, and now the owners are cracking down because another waitress reported it. The owners said the waiter can choose to keep the tip or share it, but sharing would leave them with very little.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. If the policy is no tipping, but they've allowed it in the past with a lenient approach, the owner's stance might be inconsistent. The waiter didn't know if they had to share tips before, but now the policy is changing. The key point is whether the waiter was explicitly told that tips should be shared or if the previous policy was just tolerated without any rules on distribution.\n\nThe owner's response here is that it's up to the waiter to decide whether to keep the tip or share it. That seems like they're giving the benefit of the doubt because the previous policy was ambiguous. If the owner had a strict policy all along, they might have taken the tip and split it. But since they changed the policy after the fact, and the owner is allowing the waiter to keep it, maybe the waiter isn't in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the financial situation of the waiter is important. They live in a studio apartment and the holidays are coming up. Keeping the tip could be a significant financial help. If sharing would leave them with only $150, that's a huge difference. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to the new policy, so maybe she had a motive to enforce it, possibly to ensure future tips are split. But the owner's decision to let the waiter decide suggests they aren't holding it against them.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness among staff. If the policy is now that all tips must go into a common fund, but the owner is allowing this one-time exception, it might be seen as unfair to the other waiters. However, the owner's choice here could be a way to avoid backlash from the staff who might be upset if someone else got to keep a large tip without sharing.\n\nIn the Reddit style question, the user is asking if they are the asshole for keeping the tip. The answer often depends on the expectations and the fairness of the policy. If the restaurant never enforced sharing tips before, and the owner is now changing the policy, the waiter might not be in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the old, more lenient policy. The owner's decision to let them choose might be a way to handle it without conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. They were following the previous unspoken policy, and the owner's response allows them to keep it. The financial need also plays a role, and the owner's leniency suggests they aren't holding it against the waiter.\n"
