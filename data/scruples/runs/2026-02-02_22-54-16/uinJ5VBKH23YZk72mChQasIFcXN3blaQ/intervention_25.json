Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received, given the restaurant's non-tipping policy and the new policy requiring tips to be shared.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author received a $2k tip before the policy changed. When the policy was enforced, the owners told the author they could keep it, but future tips would go to a common fund. The author is now deciding whether to keep the $2k or split it, which would leave them with $150. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nKey points to consider: The policy changed after the tip was received. The owners allowed the author to keep the tip from before the new policy. Other waiters are upset because the author kept it. The author is in a financial situation where this tip is significant. \n\nLegally or ethically, since the policy changed and the owners allowed the author to keep it, there's no obligation to share retroactively. However, there's a social norm aspect where tips in some industries are shared. But in this case, the restaurant's policy was non-tipping, and the owners gave the author permission to keep it. The author isn't obligated to share past tips when the policy changed after the fact. The other staff might feel it's unfair, but the author isn't in the wrong based on the given information. So the answer is B.\n"
