Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for keeping the tip they received at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but it's high-end with high base salaries. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer, which is against the policy. The owners had a don't-ask-don't-tell approach before, but now they're enforcing the policy strictly. The other waitstaff found out and there's a discussion about whether the tip should be shared or kept.\n\nThe author is considering keeping the tip because they need the money, especially with the holidays coming up. The key points here are the restaurant's policy, the owners' recent enforcement, and the author's personal financial situation.\n\nThe owners said it's up to the author whether to keep the tip or share it, but the author is leaning towards keeping it. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole\" (AITA). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the restaurant has a policy that tips must be shared or turned over, the author might be violating that policy. But the owners have been lenient in the past. However, now they're enforcing it strictly, so keeping the tip might not align with the new policy. \n\nEthically, in many industries, tips are considered a shared pool, especially in places where tipping is standard. But this restaurant is non-tipping, so the usual conventions might not apply. If the author is the only one who received the tip and the policy wasn't clearly communicated, there's an argument that they might not be in the wrong. However, since the owners have now made it clear that all tips must be shared, keeping it could be seen as going against the new policy and potentially being unfair to other staff members.\n\nThe author's personal financial struggles might be a mitigating factor. But if the policy is now in place, the author's decision to keep the money could be seen as undermining the policy and setting a bad precedent. On the other hand, if the previous leniency allowed similar situations and only the author is being targeted, that could be a different angle.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. If the policy is now strict and the author is aware, keeping the tip might be against the policy. However, the owners allowed the author to decide. The key is whether the author's decision to keep it violates the new policy or if the policy allows for discretion. The answer might hinge on whether the author is following the new strict policy or exploiting a loophole.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if they choose to keep it based on the owners' ambiguous guidance. However, if the policy is now strict and the author is not following it, they could be in the wrong. The fact that the owners gave them a choice complicates it. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong because the policy was unclear and they were given discretion, but if the policy is now clear and strict, they should follow it. But since the owners allowed them to decide, maybe it's not their fault.\n"
