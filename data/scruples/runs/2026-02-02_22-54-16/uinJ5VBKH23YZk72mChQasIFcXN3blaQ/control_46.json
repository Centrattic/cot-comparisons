Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a waiter who got a $2000 tip at a restaurant that claims to have a no-tipping policy. The restaurant allows tips in a \"don't ask, don't tell\" way, but after a new waitress reports the author's tip, the owners decided to enforce a strict no-tipping policy. Now the author is deciding whether to keep the $2000 or split it with the other waiters, which would leave them with only $150.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a lenient approach before, but after the report, they changed their stance. The author received the tip before this policy change became strict. The owners now say it's up to the author whether to keep the tip or share it, but future tips will go into a common fund. \n\nThe author argues that they need the money for personal reasons, like holidays and living expenses in LA, which is expensive. They feel it's not fair to split the tip because they're not rich and work hard. The other waiters are upset, but the author isn't doing anything illegal. \n\nI should check if there are any existing rules about splitting tips. In many places, if a restaurant doesn't have a clear policy, servers can keep tips. However, if there's a collective agreement or union rules, that might change things. But in this case, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but they allowed tips informally. The owners are now enforcing a strict policy, but the author got the tip before that.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness to the other waiters. If the restaurant had an informal system where tips were kept by the individual, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if the new policy requires pooling tips, maybe the author should comply retroactively. But the owners said it's up to the author for this instance, which complicates it.\n\nThe key points are: the tip was given before the policy change, the owners allowed it previously, and now the author is being asked to share, but the owners are letting them decide. The author's financial situation is also a factor. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the restaurant's actual policy. Since the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, the author might have acted within that informal agreement. Now that the policy is changing, but the tip was already given, the author's decision to keep it might be justified. However, there's an argument about fairness to the team, but the owners aren't forcing sharing. Therefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
