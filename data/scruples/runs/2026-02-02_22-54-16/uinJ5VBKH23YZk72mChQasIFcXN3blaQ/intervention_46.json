Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not sharing a tip. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye to customers who still leave tips. The person worked at a high-end place where some wealthy customers occasionally leave tips. In this case, an NBA player left a $2,000 tip. The waitress found out, reported it, leading to a meeting where the owners decided to enforce the no-tipping policy more strictly. Now, the person has to decide whether to keep the tip or split it with others, which would leave them with only $150.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the owners' recent decision. The owners previously allowed tips to be kept by the server, but after the complaint, they're changing the policy to collect tips into a common fund. The person in question received the tip before the policy change. The owners told them they could keep it, but now others are upset because the new policy is in place.\n\nIs there a policy that existed before the meeting? Yes, but it was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The owners allowed tips to be kept as long as they weren't reported. Now, after the tip was reported, the policy is changing. The person received the tip under the old policy. The owners are now saying it's up to them whether to keep it, which implies they can take it or not. \n\nThe person is choosing to keep the tip because they're not rich and need the money, especially with holidays coming. The others are upset because they think the tip should be shared. But the owners didn't enforce sharing the tip; they just mentioned future tips will go into a fund. The person's decision to keep the tip they received under the old policy might not be the wrong thing. The owners allowed it before, and now they're just changing the policy for the future.\n\nSo, considering the timeline and the owners' statements, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted under the previous lenient policy, and the new policy is for the future. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. Since the owners allowed them to keep it and there's no prior agreement to share, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
