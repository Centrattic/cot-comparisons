Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing a tip in a non-tipping restaurant. The situation involves a high-end restaurant where tips are generally not allowed, but some customers still leave them. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but now they're enforcing a stricter rule where tips must go into a common fund.\n\nThe main question is whether keeping the tip is wrong. The person in question received a $2k tip from an NBA player's $10k total. The owner let them decide to keep it or share it. The person is leaning towards keeping it, especially since they're not well-off and need the money for holidays. \n\nLooking at the restaurant's policy: originally, they turned a blind eye but now they're strict. The owners allowed the person to keep the tip as an exception, maybe to avoid retroactive punishment. The other waiters are upset, but the owner gave the choice. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the owner said it's up to the person, then keeping it isn't against policy anymore. The person isn't violating any rules by not sharing it because the owner allowed it. Also, considering their personal situation, taking the money could be seen as reasonable. The other staff might be upset, but the owner's decision gives them leeway. \n\nHowever, there's a potential argument about fairness. If others are sharing tips in the past but the person keeps theirs, it might create resentment. But the owner's new policy changes things, and the person is in a unique position where they were given the choice. \n\nLegally, if the restaurant enforces a no-tipping policy, any tips belong to the restaurant. But since the owner allowed them to keep it, it's within the rules. Ethically, it's a personal choice, and the person isn't in the wrong for making that choice based on their circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
