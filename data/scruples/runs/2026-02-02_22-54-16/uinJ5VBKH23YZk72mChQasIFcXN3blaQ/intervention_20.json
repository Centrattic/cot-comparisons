Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a waiter at a high-end restaurant in LA where there's a no-tipping policy, but the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author received a $2000 tip from a wealthy customer (NBA player), and now the restaurant is enforcing the no-tipping policy more strictly. The owner told the author they can keep the existing tip but not to accept any more, and now the author is considering keeping the money instead of sharing it with the other waiters.\n\nSo, first, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but the owners allowed tips in the past. Now they're changing the policy. The author got a tip under the old policy, and the owner isn't forcing them to share it, but others are upset. The question is if the author is in the wrong for keeping the tip when others might expect sharing.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were working under the previous policy where tips were allowed, even if not official. The tip was a one-time, large amount, and they're struggling financially. The owner hasn't mandated sharing, just future tips. So the author feels they can keep it. On the other hand, some might argue that since the restaurant is now enforcing the no-tipping policy, any tips should be pooled, especially if the staff are working together.\n\nBut the owner explicitly told the author they can keep the existing tip. So technically, the author isn't violating any current policy. The new policy is about future tips. The author isn't stealing; they received the tip under the old policy. However, the other waiters might feel that since tips are supposed to be shared, the author should now contribute. But the owner didn't enforce that for this specific case. The author is in a tough spot, but since the owner allowed them to keep it, maybe it's not their fault. The issue is more about the restaurant's policy changes and communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they follow the owner's directive. But maybe there's an unspoken norm in the industry or among the staff to share tips regardless. However, in this case, the owner didn't require sharing, so the author's decision to keep it might be justified.\n"
