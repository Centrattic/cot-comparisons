Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is that they don't accept tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, meaning they ignore it if tips are given, but now they're enforcing it more strictly. The author received a $2,000 tip from a customer, and the owners now say that any tips must go into a common fund. The author is choosing to keep the tip instead of sharing it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong by not sharing. The user wants an answer A or B, but I need to analyze it. Let's break it down.\n\nThe restaurant's policy is key here. Even though the policy was previously lenient, the owners are now making it clear that any future tips must be put into a common fund. The author's tip happened before this policy change, so technically, the owner's new rule applies to future instances, not past ones. But the owners are asking the author to decide whether to keep it or share it now. \n\nThe author is in a difficult position. They're not rich, live in a studio apartment, and the holidays are coming up. They might need this money. However, other waiters might expect that since the policy is now strict, they should share the tip. But the author's tip was before the policy change. The owners are giving them a choice now, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, in many places, tips belong to the employee unless there's a specific policy. However, since the restaurant has a policy against tipping and there's a common fund now, maybe the author is supposed to share. But since the owners allowed it previously, maybe the author isn't obligated. \n\nEthically, the author might be seen as taking advantage of a loophole. However, since the policy changed after the tip was given, the author might argue they had a right to keep it as per the previous understanding. The other waiters might feel it's unfair that someone kept a large tip when others don't get to keep theirs. \n\nBut the owners are the ones who created the new policy, so if they allowed the author to keep it before, maybe they're not wrong to keep it now. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The owners' statement that it's up to the author suggests they have discretion, but the other staff might feel it's unfair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the author is allowed to keep it, sharing might be the more ethical choice, but the author is struggling financially. The dilemma is between personal need and fairness. The user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, tips in a no-tipping restaurant are considered part of a shared pool if the establishment has such a policy. But in this case, the policy is new. Since the author received the tip before the policy was enforced, they might not be in the wrong for keeping it, especially if the owners didn't explicitly state that past tips must be shared. \n\nAlternatively, if the restaurant's policy was always that any tips must be shared, even if they were lenient before, the author might be in the wrong. But the owners' leniency suggests that they didn't enforce it before. So the author might not be in the wrong for keeping it now, given the circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the tip was received under the previous, more lenient policy, and the owners are now applying the new policy to future tips, not retroactively. The author's choice to keep the tip is within their rights based on the previous understanding, even if it's ethically debatable.\n"
