Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe restaurant is a high-end place in LA where the base salary for wait staff is higher than usual. The policy is no tipping, but sometimes customers leave tips anyway. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author got a huge tip from an NBA player\u2014$2000. A colleague found out and reported it, leading to a meeting where the owners decided to enforce the no-tipping policy strictly. Now, the author is being asked to either keep the tip or split it with everyone else, but if they split it, they'd only get around $150.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the tip. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is no tipping. The owners have been lenient before, but now they're changing the policy. The author was in a situation where they received a tip under the old, more lenient policy. The owners now say that any future tips must be pooled, but what about past ones? The author is being asked to share the $2000 tip they received before the new policy was enforced.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. The policy changed after the tip was received. The author didn't know the new policy existed when they got the tip. The owners only clarified the new rules after the fact.\n2. The colleague who reported the tip might have done so out of jealousy or to enforce the policy retroactively, which could be unfair to the author.\n3. The author is in a financial situation where this tip could help them, especially with holidays coming up. They argue that they're not rich and need the money.\n4. The owners gave the author the choice to keep the tip, even though they're enforcing the new policy moving forward.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the policy was only changed after the fact, the author might not be obligated to share the tip earned under the previous policy. The owners didn't specify any retroactive sharing, so it's up to the author's discretion. The author is being pressured to share, but the owners have given them the option to keep it. \n\nHowever, there's an argument about fairness among coworkers. If tips are pooled in the future, but past tips aren't, it might create resentment. But in this case, the author received a tip before the policy changed, and the owners didn't enforce it retroactively. The author was given a choice, so they aren't technically violating any current rules by keeping it. \n\nAdditionally, the financial situation of the author is a factor. Being in a studio apartment and working hard, the tip is a significant amount that could help them during a financially stressful time. Sharing it would leave them with very little, which might be unfair given their circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the policy changed after the fact, and they were given the choice to keep the tip. The owners didn't force them to share it, so it's a matter of their own discretion. The colleague's actions might have been more about enforcing the new policy retroactively, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
