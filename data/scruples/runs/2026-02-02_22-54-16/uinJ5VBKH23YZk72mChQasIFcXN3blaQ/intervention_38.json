Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing a tip with their fellow waiters. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is supposed to be a non-tipping place, but they have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author received a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer. Another waitress found out and reported it, leading to a meeting where the owners announced a stricter policy. The owners told the author that they can decide whether to keep the tip or share it, but future tips would go into a common fund.\n\nThe author is now considering keeping the tip, which is a significant amount for them, especially with the holidays coming up. They're worried about being seen as a bad person if they don't share.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy and the owner's response. The owners allowed the existing tip to be kept, even though they're now enforcing the policy strictly moving forward. The author is in a position where they were given the choice, so from an ethical standpoint, if the owners said it's up to them, maybe it's their decision. However, there's a sense of fairness here\u2014other waiters might expect to share in tips if they're part of a team. But since the restaurant's policy changed after the fact, and the author wasn't aware they had to share from the beginning, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlso, the waitress who reported it might have done so out of jealousy or a desire for fairness, but the owners didn't force the author to share. The author is in a vulnerable position financially, and the tip was a one-time, unexpected windfall. Ethically, if the system was previously permissive, the author might not have known they had to share. Plus, the owners gave them the choice, so maybe it's not their fault for not sharing. On the other hand, if the team shares the tips, it's a different dynamic, but the policy was unclear until now.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the owners allowed them to keep it and the policy changed after the fact. The author had no prior indication they needed to share, and they were given a choice. So the answer is B.\n"
