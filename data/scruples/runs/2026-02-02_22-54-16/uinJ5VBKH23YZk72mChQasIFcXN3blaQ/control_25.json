Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye to it. The author received a $2000 tip from a customer, specifically an NBA player. The owners later decided to enforce the policy strictly, requiring any tips to be put into a common fund. The author is now faced with the decision to keep the tip or share it, with the owners giving them the choice.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's policy and the actions of the author. The original policy was non-tipping, but there was a de facto understanding that waitstaff could keep tips if they received them. However, the owners have now changed their stance, possibly due to the new staff's complaints. The author received the tip before the policy was enforced, so there's ambiguity about whether they should have to share it retroactively.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the policy was not enforced before, the author might have a legitimate claim to the tip they received under the old understanding. The owners' sudden enforcement could be seen as a change in policy without prior notice. The author is now being asked to share the tip that was allowed under the previous, informal policy.\n\nAdditionally, the author is in a difficult financial situation, living in a studio apartment and working hard. The tip represents a significant amount to them. On the other hand, the waitress who reported the tip did so out of concern for the new policy, possibly thinking it's unfair for others to keep tips when the new rule is in place.\n\nEthically, it's a bit of a grey area. If the author knew the policy was about to change, but didn't, they might be expected to share. However, since the policy was not enforced before, and the owners are only now applying it retroactively, it could be argued that the author is in the right to keep the tip. Also, the tip was given to them specifically by a customer, which might make them the rightful recipient unless the restaurant's policy explicitly states that all tips go to a shared fund, which they didn't in the past.\n\nThe owners' statement that it's up to the author to decide suggests that they acknowledge the ambiguity. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping the tip, given the circumstances and the lack of clear prior rules.\n"
