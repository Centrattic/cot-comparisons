Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping a tip in a non-tipping restaurant. The situation is that the author works at a high-end place where tipping is supposed to be against policy, but some customers still leave tips. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The author got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, but now the owners are enforcing a stricter policy where tips must be split into a common fund. The other waitress reported the author, leading to a group meeting, and the author is wondering if they should keep the tip or share it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is non-tipping, but there's been prior leniency. The author took advantage of that leniency. Now that the policy is being enforced more strictly, the author is caught in a bit of a gray area. The owners made it clear in the meeting that future tips must go into a common fund, but for past tips, they gave the author a choice. The author is considering keeping the tip, which could be seen as selfish, but they also aren't necessarily being asked to share past tips unless they choose to.\n\nFrom the owner's perspective, the policy was in place, and even if there was leniency before, the new rules apply moving forward. The fact that the owner allowed the author to keep the tip if they wanted suggests that the owner isn't forcing them to share it. So the author isn't breaking any rules by keeping it, just not sharing. The waitress who reported them might be trying to enforce fairness, but if the owner isn't mandating sharing, the author isn't obligated to split the money. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're not rich, live in a studio apartment, and need the money for holidays. The financial situation is a personal hardship. The question is about whether keeping the tip is wrong. Since the owner allowed the choice, the author isn't violating any rules. The moral aspect is a bit different. In some cultures or workplace norms, tips might be considered communal, but in this case, the policy was non-tipping, but tips were allowed before. Now the policy is changing, but the existing tip isn't under the new policy's scope unless the author is required to share it. Since the owner didn't force the author to share, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The key points are the policy's enforcement timing and the owner's discretion in allowing the author to keep the tip. So the answer is B.\n"
