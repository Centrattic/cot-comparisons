Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a waiter who received a $2000 tip in a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a base salary, and the owners previously ignored tips but now want to enforce no tipping. The question is whether the author should share the tip or not.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the restaurant's policy. The owners had a don't ask, don't tell policy before, but now they're strict. They mentioned that any tips received will be turned over to a common fund if customers insist. However, in this case, the owner gave the author a choice to keep it or share it. The author is deciding to keep the entire amount, leading to the question of whether that's wrong.\n\nThe author argues that they're not rich, live in a studio, and need the money, especially with upcoming holidays. They feel it's their money since they received it before the new policy. The other waiters are upset, and the reporter is the one who brought it up.\n\nThe key points here are the previous policy and the new policy. The restaurant owners allowed tips before, even if they didn't acknowledge it. Now, they're changing the policy, but they gave the author a choice in this specific instance. The author didn't know the policy was about to change when they received the tip. So, the tip was given under the old, more lenient policy. The owners allowed the author to keep it, which might imply that in this case, since it's already happened, the author can keep it. The other waiters might be upset because they feel the policy now is to share, but the owner's statement was that it's up to the author. \n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. The owners didn't make it clear that tips should be shared in the past, and now they're enforcing a new policy. The author might feel it's unfair to lose all the tip when the policy changed after they received it. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for keeping it when the owners gave them the choice. Since the owner said it's up to the author, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the other staff might feel differently. However, the author didn't break any rule at the time they received the tip. The new policy is for the future, so this tip was under the old policy. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for keeping it.\n"
