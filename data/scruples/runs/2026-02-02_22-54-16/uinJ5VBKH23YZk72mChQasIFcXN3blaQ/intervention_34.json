Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a server at a non-tipping restaurant where the tip policy is a bit ambiguous. The owner has a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The user receives a $2,000 tip from a high-profile customer, and when the restaurant changes the policy to strictly enforce no tips, the user is given the choice to keep it or share it with others. The user is considering keeping the tip because they're not well-off and need the money, especially with holidays coming up.\n\nFirst, considering the restaurant's initial policy. Since the owner turned a blind eye before, the user might not have known they were violating a strict rule. The owner's sudden change in policy and the new rules about turning tips into a common fund retroactively could be an issue. The user wasn't aware of the new policy before the incident, so keeping the tip might be justified.\n\nSecond, the user's financial situation. They mention living in a studio apartment and working hard for their money. The $2,000 is a significant sum, and splitting it would leave them with only $150. The user's need is genuine, and the new policy is being enforced after the fact, which might not be fair.\n\nThird, the report by another waitress. The user's colleague reported the tip, leading to the policy change. The user isn't at fault for someone else's actions. The owners' decision to let the user keep it or not is a bit conflicting, but since they allowed the user to keep it, the user's choice isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nAlso, the ethical angle. While sharing might be seen as fair, the user wasn't informed of the new policy before receiving the tip. The owners' lack of clear communication could mean the user isn't responsible for past actions. The user is in a tough spot, needing the money, and the owners are now changing the rules retroactively.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014unfair policy change, financial need, lack of prior knowledge\u2014the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
