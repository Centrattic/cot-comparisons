Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for keeping a $2K tip.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is a non-tipping place with high base salaries. The owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy about tips. The author gets a tip from a high-profile customer, which is reported by a coworker. Now the owners are enforcing a stricter policy, making them turn over tips to a common fund. The author is deciding whether to share the tip or keep it.\n\nThe key points here: The restaurant's policy is unclear. The owners didn't explicitly forbid tips before, but now they're enforcing a new rule. The author received the tip before the new policy, so maybe they didn't know they had to share it. Also, the coworker reported the tip, which might have led to the policy change. The owners gave the author a choice to keep it or share, but the author is hesitant because they need the money for the holidays.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the policy was always against taking tips and the author was aware, they might be in the wrong. But the policy was ambiguous. The owners turned a blind eye before, so the author might not be in the wrong since they acted under the previous understanding. The coworker's report changed the policy, which complicates things. The author is now in a position where they didn't agree to the new policy, so keeping the tip could be justified as it was under the old rules. Also, the coworker's actions led to the policy change, which might make the author feel like they're being unfairly targeted. Considering the author's financial situation, keeping the tip could be seen as reasonable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the policy was unclear and the author acted under the previous understanding.\n"
