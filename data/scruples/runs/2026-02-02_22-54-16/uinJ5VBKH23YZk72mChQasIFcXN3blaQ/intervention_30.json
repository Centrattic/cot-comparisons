Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received, given the restaurant's non-tipping policy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant has a non-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye to customers who still leave tips. The author received a $2000 tip from an NBA player, and now after a policy change, the owners are enforcing that all tips must go into a common fund. However, the author is being asked to either keep the tip or split it, and they're considering keeping it.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's current policy and the owners' recent announcement. Before the policy change, the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach, but now they are strict. The author received the tip before the policy was enforced, so technically, under the old policy, it might have been acceptable. However, the owners now say they will be strict, and the author is being asked to share it now.\n\nBut the owners also said that for past incidents, it's up to the individual whether to keep it. The author is choosing not to share it, which is their right under the owners' new policy. The other waitress reported the tip, which led to the policy change. The author is in a situation where keeping the tip isn't against the new policy because it's a past occurrence, and the owners have given them discretion.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're not in the wrong because the tip was given under the previous understanding, and the new policy doesn't retroactively require sharing past tips. The waitress who reported them is now trying to get a share, but the author isn't obligated to split it since the owners allowed them to keep it if they choose. \n\nConsidering that the restaurant's policy was inconsistent before, and the owners now have a strict policy moving forward, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the old, more lenient policy. They are also facing financial hardship, which adds context to their decision. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
