Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners were turning a blind eye. The author received a tip from a customer after a big bill, and now the owners are enforcing the policy. The other waitress reported the tip, leading to a meeting where it's decided that any future tips must go into a common fund. The author is left with the choice to keep the $2K or split it with others, which would leave them with $150. They're considering keeping it because they're not rich and need the money for holidays.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is against tipping, but the owners allowed it before. Now they're enforcing it, but the author is being given a choice to keep the existing tip or share. The key here is whether there was an expectation of sharing before. If the owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, maybe there wasn't an unspoken rule to share tips. However, since the owners now say it's up to the author to keep it or split it, maybe they expect compliance with the new policy. But the author is the one who got the tip under the old policy. \n\nThe other waitress reported the tip, which might have been her misunderstanding the previous policy. The author's situation is a bit of a gray area. If the owners are allowing the author to keep the tip, but the new policy requires future tips to be shared, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping what they received under the old policy. Also, the amount is significant for someone living in LA with a studio apartment. \n\nAnother angle is the fairness to other waiters. If others didn't get tips and this one did, splitting might be fair. But if the policy didn't require sharing before, then maybe it's not required now. The author's financial situation adds to the justification of keeping it. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the owners gave them the choice and the policy was ambiguous before. The author is in a tough spot, and the decision to keep the tip is understandable given their circumstances.\n"
