Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping a tip in a non-tipping restaurant. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy. The base salary is higher than usual, and the owners have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach. The author got a $2000 tip from a customer who left $10k on an $8k bill. Another waitress reported this, leading to a meeting where the owners decided to enforce the policy more strictly. Now, the author has to decide whether to keep the tip or share it with others, which would leave them with only $150. The author is considering keeping it, especially since they're not rich and holidays are coming up.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's policy and the existing practices. The owners were previously turning a blind eye, so maybe the author didn't think they were doing anything wrong initially. When the policy changed, the owners didn't force the author to share the existing tip, just future ones. The question is whether the author is obligated to share the tip now.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. If the tip was given under the old policy where it wasn't enforced, and the owners now say it's up to the author to keep it, then the author might not have a moral obligation to share. However, in a team environment, sharing tips is common practice in many places, but this is a non-tipping restaurant with higher base pay. The author's situation is unique because the tip was a one-time occurrence, and the others aren't getting tips now. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially, so keeping the money could be seen as understandable. On the other hand, if the policy is about equal distribution, maybe they should share. But the owners didn't enforce sharing past the new policy; they just said future tips must be turned in. The existing tip is a gray area here. Since the owners allowed the author to keep it, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the waitress who reported the tip might have her own issues, but that's not the author's fault. The main thing is the restaurant's policy and the owner's decision. If they gave the author the option to keep it, then it's up to them. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping it. They're following the owner's current directive, which is to not share past tips. So, the answer would be B.\n"
