Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received in a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. The situation involves a high-end LA restaurant with a base salary for wait staff, and the owner's policy of not accepting tips. The writer got a $2k tip from a wealthy customer, but now the restaurant is enforcing a strict policy where tips have to be turned into a common fund. The writer is conflicted about keeping the tip or splitting it, given their financial struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach before, but now they're strict. The writer was allowed to keep the tip until the new policy was enforced. The key here is whether the tip was received before the policy change. If the writer got the tip before the new rule was announced, they might not be obligated to share it now. But the meeting with the owners where they said to keep it unless the customer insists on it being turned over is a bit ambiguous. \n\nThe waitress who reported the tip might have done so because the policy is now being enforced, but the owners' response was to let the writer keep it. So the writer is in a position where they were informed that they can keep the tip, but others might expect them to share due to the new policy. However, the new policy affects future tips, not past ones. The owners didn't explicitly say to share previous tips, so the writer isn't necessarily breaking any rules by keeping the $2k. \n\nAlso, the writer's personal circumstances are mentioned\u2014they're not rich, live in a studio apartment, and need the money for the holidays. The ethics here depend on the prior understanding. If the policy was always in place and the writer was just being lenient before, then keeping the tip might be seen as taking advantage. But if the policy is new and the tip was given under the old, more permissive system, the writer might be in the right to keep it. \n\nAnother angle: the waitress reported the tip, but the owners handled it by allowing the writer to keep it. If the new policy is about future tips, there's no obligation to redistribute past ones. So the writer isn't in the wrong for keeping the tip they were allowed to have under the previous policy. The main issue is that the restaurant is now changing the policy, and the writer's past actions were under the old rules. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the writer wasn't violating the current policy when they received the tip, and the owners have let them keep it. There's no moral obligation to share past tips if the policy changed after the fact. The waitress who reported might have overstepped, but the writer isn't in the wrong for keeping the money they were allowed to take.\n"
