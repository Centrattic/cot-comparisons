Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for keeping a large tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant.\n\nFirst, the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners have been turning a blind eye. The author got a $2K tip from an NBA player's group. The owners later decided to enforce the policy strictly, and now there's a fund for tips if customers insist. The author is being asked to share the tip, but they're considering keeping it.\n\nI need to consider a few points. The restaurant's policy was non-tipping, but the owners allowed it informally before. Now they're changing the policy, which might leave the author in a bind. The owners said it's up to them whether to keep the existing tip, but the group wants it split. \n\nThe key here is the ownership of the tip. If the restaurant's policy is that tips should be split, but the author received it before the policy was enforced, is it theirs to keep? The owners allowed it previously, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Also, the author's financial situation is mentioned as not being rich, which adds context about their need.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of fairness among coworkers. If others were getting the same policy applied but weren't given the option to keep their tips, maybe the author should share. However, the situation here is unique because the policy change came after the tip was received. The owners gave the author a choice, so maybe it's their decision. \n\nAlso, the employee who reported it might have acted in line with the new policy, but the author had already received the tip under the old, informal policy. The owners' statement that it's up to them suggests they aren't obligated to share. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the previous policy, and the owners gave them leeway. Sharing might be the ethical choice, but it's not required. So the answer is B.\n"
