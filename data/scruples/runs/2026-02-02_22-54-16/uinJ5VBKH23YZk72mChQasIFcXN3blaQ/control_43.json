Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is a waiter at a high-end restaurant with a no-tipping policy. The restaurant's owners have a sort of don't-ask-don't-tell approach, but now they're cracking down. The user got a $2000 tip from an NBA player, which they kept, and now others are mad, especially since the owners now say tips should go into a common fund. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners didn't have a strict policy before, but now they're enforcing it. The user got the tip before the new rules, so maybe there's ambiguity. The user might think since they didn't know about the new policy at the time, they're not at fault. But the owners are now saying that even existing tips should be shared, which complicates things.\n\nThen there's the aspect of fairness among the wait staff. The user is keeping a large sum, which could be seen as selfish, especially if others have to follow the new rules strictly. The user mentions their financial struggles, which adds context\u2014they might need the money more. However, the other waiters might feel it's unfair that one person keeps a tip while they can't.\n\nThe owners' response is also key. They left the decision to the user, which might imply that they don't want to force it but expect some compromise. The user could argue that the tip was already given under the old policy, so they have a claim to it. On the other hand, the new policy aims for fairness, and the user's choice to keep it might undermine that.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the tip was under the old policy. If the user didn't know about the impending change, they're not necessarily wrong. But if the owners now want to enforce sharing even for previous tips, the user might be seen as not cooperating. However, since the owners gave the user a choice, the user's decision to keep it isn't entirely in the wrong, especially given their personal circumstances. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the user isn't at fault since they were operating under the previous understanding.\n"
