Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high-end restaurant with a non-tipping policy. The staff has a higher base salary, and usually, customers don't tip, especially celebrities. But sometimes, someone slips a tip anyway. The owners kind of looked the other way before, but now there's a new policy where tips have to be turned into a common fund.\n\nThe author got a $2k tip from an NBA player, but when the new policy came up, they were told they could keep it. Now, another waitress reported them, leading to a meeting where the owners said they should either keep it or share it. The author is considering keeping the whole tip, which would mean not sharing with others, and they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Initially, it was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. So the owners didn't enforce it strictly before. Then, after some new waitresses complained, the owners changed the policy to be stricter. Now, tips have to go into a common fund, but the author's situation is a bit of a gray area because the owners said they could keep the tip they already received. However, the author is faced with the choice between keeping the money or sharing it, which would leave them with very little.\n\nThe key points here are: the original policy was lax, the owners changed the policy after complaints, and now they're handling past tips in a way that allows individuals to keep them. The author is in a financial situation where they need the money for holidays, which might be a valid personal hardship.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of fairness. If the new policy is about fairness and sharing tips among all staff, then keeping the $2k might be seen as selfish. However, the owners allowed the author to keep it, so maybe they're not enforcing it retroactively. The other waitress reported the tip, which might be seen as trying to enforce the new policy, but since the owners gave the author the choice, the author isn't breaking any rules now.\n\nSo, the author isn't explicitly violating any current policy because the owners gave them the option. The original policy was more lenient, so there's a bit of a loophole. However, morally, if the new policy is about sharing, maybe the author should consider sharing. But since it's their decision, and the owners didn't force it, maybe they're not in the wrong for keeping it. Also, the financial need is a factor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. If the policy now requires sharing, but the owners allowed them to keep it, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, Not in the wrong.\n"
