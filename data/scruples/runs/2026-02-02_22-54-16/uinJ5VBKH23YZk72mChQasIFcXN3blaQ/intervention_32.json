Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a waitress who got a $2,000 tip from a customer at a \"non-tipping\" restaurant. The restaurant has a high base salary and a policy where employees aren't supposed to accept tips. The owners have been turning a blind eye until someone reported the incident, leading to a new strict policy. Now the author is being asked to share the tip or keep it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the restaurant's policy. The owners said they had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, meaning they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule strictly. The author took advantage of that by keeping the tip. Now, after being caught, they're enforcing the policy more strictly, requiring tips to be turned into a common fund. The author is conflicted about splitting the $2,000, which would leave her with only $150 if shared. She's in a tight financial situation, especially around the holidays, so she's hesitant to share.\n\nThe key points here are the previous leniency of the owners and the sudden change in policy. Before, they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule, so the author had a reasonable expectation that keeping the tip was acceptable. Now, the owners are changing the rules after the fact, which could be seen as unfair. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she followed the existing policy at the time she received the tip. The new policy is applied retroactively, which might not be fair to her.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's policy is a bit ambiguous. If they never clearly communicated that all tips must be shared, the author might not be at fault. The fact that the owners turned a blind eye before suggests that there was a tacit acceptance of tips being kept by individuals. Now, they're trying to enforce a rule that wasn't strictly enforced before, which could be seen as trying to get the money back after the fact.\n\nAnother angle is the financial situation. The author isn't wealthy and needs the money, especially during holidays. The amount she's being asked to share would leave her with very little, which adds to the moral dilemma. The other waitress reported her, which might indicate a lack of trust or a possible personal issue there. If the restaurant had a clear policy from the start that all tips must be pooled, then the author might be at fault, but since the policy was inconsistently enforced, it's a bit different.\n\nIn many places, tips are supposed to be shared among staff, but this is a restaurant that's structured with a higher base salary and a non-tipping policy. So the employees might not be expected to share tips if the policy wasn't enforced. The sudden change might be more about the restaurant wanting to collect that $2,000 rather than the employees keeping it. The author's situation is complicated because the rules weren't clear, and the enforcement changed after she received the tip.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she acted under the existing policy that was in place when she received the tip. The restaurant's decision to enforce a new policy retroactively complicates things. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
