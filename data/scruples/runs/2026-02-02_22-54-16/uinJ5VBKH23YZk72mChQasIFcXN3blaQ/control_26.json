Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing a tip they received at a non-tipping restaurant. The restaurant has a high base salary, and the owners have a sort of \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding tips. The person got a $2000 tip from a customer, but now the owners are enforcing a strict no-tipping policy, and the other waiters want the tip split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. Even though the owners didn't enforce it before, they now say no tips. So maybe the previous leniency doesn't apply anymore. The person was given a choice to keep the tip or share it. The question is whether they're obligated to share it now.\n\nIn many restaurants, especially those with a tip pooling policy, all tips are pooled and shared among staff. If the restaurant now requires that tips go into a common fund, then the person might be in the wrong by keeping the tip. But in this case, the owners allowed the tip in the past, and now they're changing the policy. The person received the tip before the new policy was enforced. The owners told them it's up to them whether to keep it, but they're supposed to share it in the future.\n\nSo the key here is that the tip was given under previous, more lenient rules. The restaurant is now enforcing a strict policy, but the person isn't being forced to share the tip they already received. The owners are letting them keep it, which suggests that there's no obligation to share past tips. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong for keeping the $2000 they were allowed to keep. They might be expected to follow the new rules moving forward, but the past tip is their own. The other staff might be upset, but since the owners didn't require sharing it, the person isn't wrong for keeping it.\n"
