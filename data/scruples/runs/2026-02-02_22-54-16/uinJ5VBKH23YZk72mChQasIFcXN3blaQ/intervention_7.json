Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2,000 tip with fellow waiters. The restaurant has a no-tipping policy, but the owners turned a blind eye in the past. Now they're enforcing it more strictly. The NBA player left a $2K tip, and the author kept it.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy is key. Even if the owners didn't enforce it before, the new policy requires turning tips into a common fund. However, the owners told the author they could keep the tip, but others would have to split it. The author is deciding whether to keep the $2K or share it. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're not rich, living in a studio, and need the money, especially with holidays coming. They also don't want to be a terrible person. The question is about right and wrong here.\n\nThe owners allowed the author to keep it, so legally, they might not be wrong. But morally, should they share? If others are now forced to turn in tips, but the author is given a choice, there's a possible inconsistency. However, the owners didn't force the author to share, so maybe it's their decision. \n\nThe author isn't violating the new policy because it's their past tip. The new policy applies to future tips. The author's situation is unique due to the NBA player's generosity. So maybe keeping it isn't wrong. Also, the previous don't-ask-don't-tell policy implies some flexibility. The author isn't the one enforcing the new rules; the owners are. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the owners allowed it, and they're acting in their own financial interest without violating any current policies. The moral dilemma is personal, but the legal/employment side is on their side. Answer B.\n"
