Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing a $2000 tip they received at a restaurant that has a no-tipping policy but previously turned a blind eye. The restaurant owners now want to enforce the policy strictly, and the author is being asked to either keep the tip or split it with other waiters, which would leave them with only $150.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy before, meaning they didn't enforce the no-tipping rule strictly. Now they're changing that, and the author is caught in the middle. The key point here is that the owners allowed tips in the past but are now cracking down. The author received the tip during a time when the policy was still in the old, more lenient state. \n\nThe other waitress reported the author, which led to a meeting where the owners decided to enforce the new policy. The owners then said it's up to the author whether to keep the tip, but if they keep it, they shouldn't expect to keep future tips. The author is considering keeping the money, which would mean not sharing it with others. The question is whether this makes the author at fault.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, the restaurant's rules have changed. The author followed the previous policy, which didn't require sharing tips. Now, the new policy requires turning tips into a common fund. However, the author is being asked to retroactively comply with the new policy. If the owners allowed tips in the past without requiring sharing, the author might not be obligated to share now. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of fairness. Other waiters might feel it's unfair that the author kept the tip when others might have been in similar situations. However, the author is in a personal financial struggle, living in a studio apartment and facing holiday expenses. The tip is a significant amount for them. \n\nThe owners' response was to let the author decide, indicating they don't see it as a major issue. The waitress who reported the tip might have done so out of jealousy or to push for a more equitable distribution, but the owners didn't force the author to share. \n\nLegally, if the restaurant has a no-tipping policy, tips could be considered the restaurant's property. However, since the restaurant allowed tips in the past, it's unclear if the author is legally obligated to share. The author might have a moral dilemma, but legally or ethically, they might not be in the wrong, especially since the owners allowed it before and are now letting them decide. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping the tip they received under the previous policy. The owners' new policy applies going forward, but the situation is about a past event. The author's decision to keep the tip is understandable given their financial situation, and the owners didn't force them to share. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
