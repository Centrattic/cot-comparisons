Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I\u2019m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don\u2019t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a waiter who got a $2000 tip from a customer, but the restaurant has a \"no tipping\" policy. The owners had a sort of don't ask, don't tell policy before, but now they're cracking down. The waitress reported the author, and the owners told the author they can keep it but future tips must go into a common fund. The author is considering keeping the tip, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policy. The owners had a policy against tipping, but they were turning a blind eye before. Now they're enforcing it strictly. The author got the tip before the policy change, so technically, maybe the author wasn't supposed to accept it even then. But the owners allowed it before, so maybe the author didn't know it was off-limits.\n\nThen, when the waitress reported the tip, the owners made a new rule. They told the author they could keep it, but future tips would be pooled. So the owners didn't force the author to share the existing tip. That seems like they gave the author the choice. If the owners said it's up to the author, then keeping it might be acceptable since they didn't demand sharing.\n\nAnother angle: the author is struggling financially. The tip is a significant amount for them, and sharing it would leave them with only $150. The author might feel it's unfair to share because they earned it from a specific customer. However, some might argue that tips are a communal pool in some restaurants, even if not officially stated. But the restaurant's policy was against it until now, so maybe the other waiters aren't used to that.\n\nAlso, the waitress who reported the author might be trying to enforce the new policy strictly, but the owners gave the author the choice. So the author isn't violating a rule by keeping it. The moral dilemma is whether to be selfish or share, but legally or by policy, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the owners allowed the author to keep the tip, the policy changed after the fact, and the author isn't obligated to share. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The answer would be B.\n"
