And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) who's concerned their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything and is just watching TV and being on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, but they're pressuring her, introducing her to various activities, and she's calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the parents' actions are reasonable or if they're overstepping. The parents say they're letting her choose what she wants to do, as long as she does something and is good at it. But the key here is that they're imposing a condition that she must be good at something. The problem is that the parents might be projecting their own expectations rather than respecting Ellie's autonomy. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are often exploring their interests and identities. Forcing them to excel in something they don't choose could be counterproductive. The parents are trying to guide her, but their approach might not be considering Ellie's preferences and her natural inclinations. Also, labeling her as \"aimless\" and making her feel that she needs to meet certain standards could be causing stress or resentment. \n\nThe parents might not be controlling in the sense of dictating specific choices, but their insistence that she must be good at something could be seen as pressuring her, even if they're offering options. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels the pressure is there despite their intentions. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider the ethical angle. Are the parents wrong for expecting their daughter to have a hobby or skill? Or is it reasonable for parents to encourage their child to be engaged? However, the line between encouragement and pressure is thin. The key issue is that the parents are not allowing her to choose without the condition of being good at it. That's where the potential overstepping occurs. \n\nSo, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing their own values on their daughter's interests and achievements. The daughter's right to choose her own path, even if it's not what the parents want, is important. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
