And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't involved in anything, just watching TV and using her phone. The parents are pushing her to engage in activities but she's resisting, calling them controlling. The author thinks they're not controlling, just giving her choices but expecting her to commit to something.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are the parents' intentions versus the daughter's feelings. The parents want the daughter to have hobbies or activities where she can excel. They've tried introducing various activities, but she's not interested. The daughter feels pressured and labels them as controlling. The parents argue that they're giving her freedom of choice but want her to be committed to something.\n\nI need to consider if expecting your child to be involved in something is inherently wrong. On one hand, parents wanting their kids to have interests and not be idle is common. On the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is an age where autonomy is important. If the parents are pushing her without respecting her preferences, that could be problematic. The daughter's resistance and feeling of being controlled suggests that the approach might be too forceful, even if the parents think they're offering choices.\n\nAlso, the parents are emphasizing that she needs to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something. That could imply pressure to excel, which might be counterproductive. The daughter's lack of interest in all the activities they've introduced might indicate that the parents aren't considering her actual interests. If the child isn't into the activities, forcing her to engage just to be good at something could be harmful to her self-esteem and autonomy.\n\nBut the parents' concern about her being aimless and only engaging in passive activities like watching TV is valid. Many parents want their children to be active and have constructive hobbies. However, the method here seems to be the issue. If the parents are not respecting her resistance and are framing it as a choice but with the underlying pressure to conform, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they are imposing their expectations under the guise of offering choices, which the daughter perceives as controlling. The key is the balance between guiding the child and respecting her autonomy. The author's approach seems to lack understanding of the daughter's perspective and genuine interests, which is where they might be mistaken.\n"
