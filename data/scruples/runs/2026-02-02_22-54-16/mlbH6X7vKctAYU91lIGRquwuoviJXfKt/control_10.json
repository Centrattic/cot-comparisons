And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents are pushing her to be involved in some activity, not specifying which, but expecting her to excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. At 15, teenagers are often figuring out their interests and strengths. It's a time of exploration. The parents are introducing her to various activities, which is good, but the daughter is resisting, feeling controlled. The parents say they're not forcing her to choose their interests but want her to choose something. However, the pressure to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" might be the issue here.\n\nThe parents' intention is to provide structure and encourage engagement, which is understandable. But the daughter's perspective is key. If she's not interested in any activities, pushing for her to excel might not be the right approach. It's possible that the parents are projecting their own desires onto their child without considering her personality or interests. Also, the daughter's current activities (TV and phone) might be a coping mechanism or a way she's dealing with stress or lack of motivation.\n\nAnother angle is the pressure to be \"good at something.\" Society often values excelling in certain areas, but not every teenager is driven or interested in such pursuits. The parents might be setting unrealistic expectations without understanding their daughter's unique path. The daughter calling them \"controlling\" suggests that the approach is making her feel pressured rather than supported.\n\nIt's also important to consider the daughter's autonomy. At 15, she's developing her own identity. While parents can guide, they should respect her choices. If the daughter isn't interested in any activities, maybe the parents need to explore why that is, rather than pushing for her to be good at something. There might be underlying issues affecting her motivation, like anxiety or feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents might not be entirely in the wrong, as they're trying to encourage their child's development. However, their approach could be too rigid. The key issue is the expectation that she must excel in something, which might not be realistic or healthy. The daughter's well-being and her own interests should be prioritized over parental expectations.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parents' expectations are reasonable. If they're pushing for excellence without considering their daughter's preferences and emotional state, they could be in the wrong. But if they're simply encouraging her to find some passion, that's different. The line is thin here, but the emphasis on being \"the best\" and the daughter's resistance suggest the parents might be overstepping.\n"
