And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the parent) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent feels their daughter isn't into anything, just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have interests and excel in something. It's common for parents to hope their kids find passions or strengths. But the approach might be the issue. The parent says they aren't forcing specific activities but expect her to do something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled, which suggests the pressure might be coming through even if it's not direct.\n\nNext, the daughter's age is 15. At this age, teens often explore their own interests and might push back against parental expectations. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being invaded, even if the parents think they're giving choices. The parents' insistence on being \"good at something\" could be creating stress, making the daughter withdraw more.\n\nThe key here is the balance between encouragement and pressure. While it's natural for parents to want their kids to engage in activities, imposing an expectation to be \"good\" might be counterproductive. It's important to foster intrinsic motivation rather than external pressure. The parents might be overlooking the daughter's need to self-discover without feeling forced. \n\nAlso, the daughter's response of calling them controlling indicates that she feels pressured, which might mean the parents aren't respecting her autonomy enough. Even if they present options, the underlying message that she must excel in something could be too much. The parents might not realize that their approach is stifling her ability to explore on her own terms.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are to help their daughter find direction, their method might be the problem. The daughter needs space to find her own interests without the pressure of parental expectations to be \"the best.\" Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach could be causing more resistance and stress rather than encouraging the daughter to explore her passions.\n"
