And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent feels their daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents are trying to get her involved in various activities but she's resisting and calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to have a passion or hobby, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not forcing her to do what they like, but they do want her to be good at something. The key here is the pressure to excel. Is it wrong to want your child to have some interest or skill? Well, it's natural for parents to hope their children have direction and pursue something meaningful. However, the line between support and pressure is thin here.\n\nNow, the daughter is 15, which is a teenager. At this age, kids often explore their interests and may not have found their passion yet. The parents are introducing her to various activities, but she's not interested. Forcing or pressuring a teenager can lead to resistance and pushback, as seen here. The daughter labels them as controlling, which suggests she feels the pressure is stifling her autonomy.\n\nThe parents\u2019 approach is to let her choose but require that she be good at it. The problem is that the parents are not just supporting her in finding her interests but are also setting a condition of being \"good\" or \"the best\" at something. This could be where they cross into being in the wrong. Wanting their child to be involved is one thing, but expecting excellence might be imposing their own standards and possibly their unmet ambitions onto the child.\n\nAlso, the parents are upset about her current activities (TV and phone), which are passive. But teenagers often go through phases of disengagement, and it's not necessarily a problem. The key is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy. The daughter might need time to figure things out, and the parents might be overstepping by not allowing her to explore without the pressure of excellence.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents have good intentions but might be applying pressure under the guise of support. The daughter's resistance is a valid reaction if she feels controlled. The parents' emphasis on being \"good\" at something could be the issue, as it's not just about participation but performance. This might not foster a genuine interest but instead create stress and resentment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be in the wrong because they're not just encouraging exploration but also imposing their expectations of excellence, which could be stifling the daughter's natural development and autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
