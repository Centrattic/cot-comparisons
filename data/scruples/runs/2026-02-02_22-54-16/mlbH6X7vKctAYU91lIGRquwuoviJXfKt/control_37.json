And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and they're pushing her to find an activity where she can excel. The parent feels they're not controlling, just encouraging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or skills, which is a common concern for parents wanting their kids to have structure and interests. But the daughter is calling them controlling, even though they say they're not forcing her to choose a specific activity. However, the parent is still setting a condition that she must be good at something, which might be the issue.\n\nThe daughter is 15, an age where autonomy is important. Pressuring her to excel in something she's not interested in could lead to resentment. The parent might not realize that the pressure is coming through, even if they're not dictating the activity. The daughter's lack of engagement (watching Netflix, being on phone) suggests she might not feel motivated or supported in the right way.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her being aimless. It's not uncommon for teens to struggle with finding their interests, especially without guidance. The parent is trying to expose her to various options, which is a good approach. But maybe the expectation that she must be good at something is too much. The key here is whether the parent is respecting the daughter's autonomy versus imposing their own values.\n\nThe parent says they're not controlling, but the daughter feels that way. It's possible that the parent is overstepping by having an unspoken expectation that she must commit to something and excel, even if it's not her choice. The answer might hinge on the balance between providing opportunities and respecting the child's preferences.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is to help, but the approach might be too pushy, leading the daughter to feel controlled. That would mean the parent is in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
