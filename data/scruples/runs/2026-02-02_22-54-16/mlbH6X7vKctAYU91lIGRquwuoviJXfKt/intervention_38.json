And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nHmm, first, the parents' intention is to encourage their daughter to have some hobbies or interests, which is a common parental concern. They want her to have direction and not be aimless. But the daughter is feeling pressured even though the parents say they're not forcing specific activities. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. \n\nThe parents mention they're not dictating what she should do but expect her to be good at \"something.\" But they might be imposing their own expectations without respecting her autonomy. At 15, teenagers often push back against control, so the daughter's reaction is understandable. The parents' requirement that she must be \"the best or at least good\" at something could be setting unrealistic expectations. Maybe they should accept that she's still figuring things out instead of pushing for excellence in any area. \n\nAlso, the parents seem to be using a \"do something or face consequences\" approach. The daughter feels controlled, which might stifle her intrinsic motivation. Encouragement without pressure might be more effective. So, while their concern is valid, their approach might be the issue. They might not realize they're being controlling despite their intentions. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (they are in the wrong) because the parents are pressuring the daughter in a way that's making her feel controlled, even if they think they're being supportive. They need to respect her autonomy and allow her to find her own path without the expectation of excellence in any specific activity.\n"
