And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. The parents are pushing her to find something and be good at it, but she's resisting and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have hobbies, be engaged, and excel in something. That's a common parental concern, wanting their kids to have structure and achievements. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and pursue it. They see it as giving her freedom but setting expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when many kids start to develop their own interests and identity. If the parents are pushing her to find something and be good at it, maybe they're imposing their own expectations without considering her preferences. The daughter feels controlled, which could be valid if she's not given genuine autonomy. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or if they're genuinely trying to encourage without pressure.\n\nThe parents say they're letting her choose whatever she wants as long as she does something. But maybe the problem is that the expectation to be \"good at something\" is itself a pressure. Teenagers might need time to explore without the pressure of excelling. If she's not interested in any of the activities they introduce, maybe she hasn't found her passion yet, and the parents' approach might be too rigid.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) aren't harmful, but the parents might see them as a lack of direction. However, every teenager is different. Some might not be into extracurriculars but still be happy and healthy. The parents' concern is valid, but the method of introducing her to various activities without her input could be the issue.\n\nI need to balance between the parents' intentions and the daughter's autonomy. Are the parents wrong for wanting her to be engaged? Not necessarily, but if they're pressuring her to the point where she feels controlled, that's a problem. The line between encouragement and control is thin here. Since the daughter is calling them controlling, there's a conflict in perception. The parents might not see themselves as controlling, but their actions are causing that feeling.\n\nIn terms of the AITA question, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is stifling the daughter's ability to explore her own interests naturally. Teenagers need space to find their own paths, and constant pressure to excel in something might lead to resistance. The key point is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy while encouraging her to find her own interests, versus imposing their expectations under the guise of freedom.\n"
