And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is worried about their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, who isn't into anything. They mention her grades are average, she doesn't participate in any activities, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities. However, Ellie feels controlled and resists.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. First, the parents are pushing for Ellie to engage in activities, but they claim they're not forcing her to choose specific things. They're giving her options but expecting her to commit to something. However, Ellie is 15, an adolescent, and this is a time when teens often seek autonomy. The parents might be overstepping by pressuring her to be \"the best\" or at least good at something, which could create stress and resentment. \n\nThe parents' reasoning is that doing nothing isn't acceptable. But is it their place to enforce this? Each child is different. Some kids naturally gravitate towards activities, others might not yet find their passion. The parents are introducing her to many things, but maybe the pressure to excel in one is overwhelming. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels coerced even if they aren't making her choose a specific activity. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she might need guidance but also space to explore her own interests without the pressure to be \"good at something.\" The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto her, wanting her to have a well-rounded profile for future success. However, this could be infringing on her autonomy and possibly stifering her genuine interests or causing burnout. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative vs. authoritarian. If the parents are being too directive, even with good intentions, it could be problematic. The daughter's resistance indicates that their approach might not be effective or respectful of her needs. So, the parents might be in the wrong for expecting her to excel in something without considering her personal inclinations and the adolescent need for independence.\n"
