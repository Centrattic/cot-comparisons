And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, average grades, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, trying to introduce various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have hobbies or interests beyond TV and phone. They're trying to expose her to different options. But the daughter feels pressured. The parents say they aren't forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. However, the daughter feels controlled. \n\nIs expecting a teenager to have interests or hobbies unreasonable? Well, adolescents often go through phases of disinterest or figuring out their interests. Pushing them might backfire. The parents are imposing their own values, maybe thinking that being good at something is important for her future or self-esteem. But the daughter's resistance suggests she feels the pressure is too much.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be concerned about her lack of direction. They might believe that having a hobby or talent is beneficial. But the way they're approaching it by constantly introducing new activities without her input could be overwhelming. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy. If they're making her feel like she has to choose something and be good at it, even if it's framed as \"free choice,\" it might not be genuinely free. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling indicates that she perceives pressure. Even if the parents don't mean to be controlling, their actions might be seen that way. The parents might need to step back and let her explore on her own terms. It's possible that the daughter is going through a phase where she's not interested in anything, and pushing for her to excel at something might not be the right approach. \n\nIn terms of whether the parents are in the wrong, it's about balance. While it's reasonable to encourage interests, the method matters. If the parents are creating a sense of obligation without understanding her feelings, that could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations that the daughter feels pressured under, even if they think they're being supportive. But there's also a valid concern from the parents about their daughter's lack of engagement. However, the way they're handling it might be the issue here.\n"
