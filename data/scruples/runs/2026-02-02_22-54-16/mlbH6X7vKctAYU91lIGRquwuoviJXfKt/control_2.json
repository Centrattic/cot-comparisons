And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents want her to excel in something, not necessarily what they did, but to have a hobby or skill. They feel doing nothing isn't acceptable.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have interests and skills, not just be idle. That's a common concern for parents. But the daughter is 15, a teenager, which is a time when many kids are exploring their own passions and identities. The parents are pushing her to commit to something and be \"good\" at it, but they might be imposing their own values or fears onto her.\n\nThe daughter is calling them controlling. Pushing a teenager to take up various activities could be seen as pressuring her, even if they say they're not forcing her into a specific activity. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy. Letting her choose what she does is good, but the underlying expectation that she must be \"good\" at it and that doing nothing is unacceptable might be the issue. \n\nAdolescents often need to figure out their own paths. If the parents are pushing for her to have achievements, it might be more about their own desires or societal pressures rather than what's best for Ellie. The fact that she's resisting and feels controlled suggests that the approach isn't working. The parents might not be considering her personal interests or the fact that she might not be ready to commit yet. \n\nAlso, the parents' focus on her being \"the best\" or \"good\" could be setting unrealistic expectations. It's important for teens to explore without the pressure of excelling. The parents might be right in wanting her to have hobbies or activities, but their method of introducing a variety of options and emphasizing the need to be good at something might be too much. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The parents have valid concerns about their daughter's engagement, but their approach could be seen as overbearing. They might not be respecting her autonomy or her need to explore without pressure. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for expecting her to be good at something in a controlling way, not allowing her the space to find her own interests without pressure to excel.\n"
