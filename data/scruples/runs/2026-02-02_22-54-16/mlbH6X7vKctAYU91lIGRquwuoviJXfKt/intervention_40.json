And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just grades average and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents are trying to get her into various activities but she's resistant and calls them controlling. The author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have some passion or hobby, which is a common parental concern. They\u2019re not forcing specific activities but encouraging her to choose something she likes. Their intention is to help her gain skills or interests, which might be seen as wanting her to have more direction.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, an adolescent. That's a time when teens often seek independence. If the parents are pressuring her, even if they say they're not, the way they're approaching it might come off as controlling. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the pressure is felt. Even if they\u2019re not forcing her into specific activities, the expectation that she must be good at something could be a source of stress for her.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the parents are trying to encourage participation without enforcing specific choices, but the daughter feels pressured. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, adolescents need autonomy. If the parents are not allowing her to explore without pressure, that could be problematic. However, the parents' concern about her being aimless might stem from a place of wanting her to have opportunities and develop skills. But the line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. If the daughter is not into anything and the parents are pushing for her to be good at something, maybe it's not recognizing her current interests or her need for self-exploration.\n\nAlso, the daughter's age is important. At 15, she might still be figuring out her interests. Forcing or even expecting her to excel in something might not account for her developmental stage. The parents might not be in the wrong in intention, but their approach might not be effective or supportive. \n\nBut the parent says they\u2019re letting her choose, as long as she does something. So their approach is about giving her options but expecting results. However, expecting her to be \"good\" at something might be unrealistic if she's not showing interest. The parents might be conflating having an activity with being good at it. Maybe just participating and exploring is enough, but the parents want her to not just do something, but to be good at it. That adds another layer of pressure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a black-and-white issue. But from the parent's perspective, they\u2019re acting out of concern for their daughter's future. However, from the daughter's perspective, it feels controlling. So perhaps the parents are overstepping by imposing an expectation without considering her current state. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents are respecting the daughter's autonomy versus their own expectations. If they\u2019re pressuring her to be good at something, they might be in the wrong. But if they're just encouraging exploration without forcing, maybe not. The daughter calling them controlling suggests that the approach is too pushy. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if they're genuinely giving her freedom to choose any activity, maybe it's B. \n\nBut the key is \"as long as she does something and is good at it.\" The expectation of being good might be the issue. Adolescents might need trial and error, and not every attempt leads to being good. The parents might be setting up a scenario where the daughter feels she must succeed in something, which could lead to anxiety. So maybe the parents are in the wrong because they\u2019re not allowing her to explore without the pressure of being good at it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
