And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel in something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watching TV and using her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she's resistant, even calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents want their daughter to have some passion or skill, which is a common parental desire. They mention not forcing her to choose specific activities but want her to commit to something. The daughter is 15, which is a time when teenagers often explore their interests. However, the parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or at least good at something. That might be where the line is crossed. \n\nOn one hand, encouraging a child to find hobbies or passions is normal. It can help with self-esteem and future opportunities. But the key here is the pressure. The parents are expressing dissatisfaction with her current state of being \"aimless\" and not involved. They're introducing her to various activities, but she's not interested. If the parents are making her feel like she must excel in something, that could be problematic. \n\nThe daughter feels controlled, which suggests that the approach might be too pushy. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, the daughter's reaction indicates she perceives it as controlling. At 15, teenagers are developing their independence, and too much pressure from parents can lead to resistance and conflict. \n\nAlso, expecting a teenager to be \"the best\" at something might not be realistic for everyone. Not all kids are destined to be exceptional in a particular area, and it's important to respect their interests, even if they're not traditional. The daughter might not have found her passion yet, and pushing her might stifle her natural exploration. \n\nHowever, the parents' concern about her lack of engagement is valid. It's natural for parents to want their children to have interests and hobbies. The issue here might be the approach. Instead of expecting excellence, focusing on finding activities she genuinely enjoys, even if they're not high-achieving, could be more effective. The parents might need to adjust their expectations and support Ellie in her own way of finding interests without pressure. \n\nIn summary, while the parents have good intentions, their method of expecting excellence in something and the daughter's reaction suggest that they might be overstepping. The key is whether the pressure is realistic and supportive or if it's causing stress and resentment. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're imposing expectations that aren't aligned with the daughter's interests and are making her feel controlled.\n"
