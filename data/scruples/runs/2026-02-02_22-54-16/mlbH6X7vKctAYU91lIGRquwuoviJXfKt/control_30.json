And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything\u2014average grades, no extracurriculars, and just uses her phone and watches Netflix. They tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider normal adolescent behavior. At 15, teenagers are often figuring out their interests and may not have a clear passion yet. It's common for some teens to go through phases of not being deeply engaged in activities. The parents' concern is valid because they want her to be motivated and productive, but pushing too hard might backfire.\n\nThe parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels pressured, which is a red flag. Even if the parents aren't assigning specific tasks, the expectation to \"be good at something\" might be too vague or unrealistic. It's possible they're not respecting her autonomy by imposing this pressure, even if unintentionally.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's perspective. If she's labeled as \"aimless,\" but she's in a developmental stage where that's normal, the parents' frustration might stem from their own expectations rather than Ellie's actual needs. It's important to balance parental guidance with allowing her to explore at her own pace without guilt-tripping her.\n\nAlso, considering mental health. Pushing a teenager to perform in activities they don't enjoy can lead to stress, anxiety, or resentment. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, which the parents might not be acknowledging. The parents need to validate her feelings and encourage without coercion.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, they have valid concerns about their daughter's engagement, but their approach might be too rigid. They might be overlooking the normal teenage process of self-discovery and instead imposing their expectations, which can harm the parent-child relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they're not allowing their daughter the space to find her own interests without pressure, even if their intentions are good.\n"
