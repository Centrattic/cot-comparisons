And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parent says they aren't forcing specific interests but want her to do something and be good at it.\n\nHmm, so the parent's intention is to help Ellie find something where she can shine, but Ellie feels pressured. The key here is whether the parent is being overbearing. The parent claims they're letting her choose, but the underlying message is that she must be good at it. Even if they present options, if the expectation is high that she must succeed in one, that could be seen as pressure. At 15, teens are experimenting with their identities. Maybe Ellie is still figuring out her interests, and the pressure is making her push back. \n\nAlso, the parent is frustrated with her current state of being \"aimless,\" but everyone has different paces. Some kids are introverted or take longer to find their passion. The parent's actions might be coming across as controlling because they're trying to direct her choices under the guise of offering options. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that the outcome matters, which could be the issue. The parent might not be forcing a specific activity, but the expectation to be good at any activity they choose is a form of pressure. \n\nEllie's reaction is important too. If she's labeling them as controlling, that's a sign she feels pressured. Even if the parents don't mean to be, their approach might be smothering. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. In terms of parenting, it's about balance between support and pressure. The parents want to encourage their daughter to develop skills and find a passion, which is understandable. But if they're not respecting her autonomy and current lack of interest, that's where they might be at fault. \n\nSo, expecting a child to be good at something isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of introducing her to everything and not accepting her current state without pressure might be. The parent's motivation is good, but the approach could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations without considering Ellie's readiness or her need for self-guided exploration. Alternatively, if the parent's goal is to help her find a passion and they're open to her choice, maybe it's not their fault. But given the details, the pressure to be good seems present, leading to the daughter's negative reaction. So, I think A is the right answer here.\n"
