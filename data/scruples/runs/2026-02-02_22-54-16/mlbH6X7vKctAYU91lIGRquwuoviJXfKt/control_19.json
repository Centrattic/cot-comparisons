And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to engage in activities. The parents tried introducing various things but she's resistant, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting advice. It's common for parents to want their kids to have hobbies or extracurricular activities, as they can help with social skills, discipline, etc. But the issue here is the pressure. The parents are saying they want her to be good at something, but not specifying what. They're letting her choose, but expecting her to be \"good\" at it. The daughter feels controlled even though the parents claim they're not forcing specific choices.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 15, an adolescent, which is a time when teens often seek autonomy. The parents' approach might be coming across as pressuring her to conform to their expectations, even if they're not forcing her to pick a specific activity. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. If the parents are emphasizing that she must excel or be good at something, that could be creating stress without considering her interests.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) are passive. The parents are concerned about her lack of engagement. But maybe the daughter is going through a phase, or has different interests, or might not be ready to commit. The parents might not be allowing her the space to explore her own interests without judgment. Their approach could be counterproductive if it's making her resistant because she feels controlled.\n\nBut then, is it wrong to want your child to have some passions or skills? It's a common parental desire. However, the method here might be problematic. The parents are focusing on the outcome (being good at something) rather than the process of exploration. The daughter might need more support in finding her interests, not pressure to excel. The parents might be in the wrong if their expectations are unrealistic or if they're not respecting her autonomy, even if their intentions are good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations on their daughter's interests and success, which can be harmful to her autonomy and intrinsic motivation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if they're just encouraging her to engage in activities. But the key here is the pressure to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something, which might not be the daughter's goal. The daughter's feelings of being controlled suggest that the parents' approach is too heavy-handed. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
