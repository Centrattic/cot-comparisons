And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parent feels they\u2019re not being controlling but want her to excel in something, even if it's not what they choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about Ellie's future and want her to have skills or interests that could lead to success or fulfillment. It's common for parents to hope their children find their passion or areas of strength. But there's a balance between support and pressure. The parent says they're letting her choose what she does, just that she needs to be good at it. But the daughter feels controlled, which is a key point.\n\nOn the other hand, teenagers at 15 are often figuring out their interests and identity. Forcing or even strongly encouraging them to excel in something might not be the best approach. It's possible that the parent's expectations are unrealistic or not aligned with Ellie's natural inclinations. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels pressured, which might stem from the parent's insistence on her being good at something regardless of her choice.\n\nThe line between encouragement and control is thin. The parent's actions\u2014introducing various activities\u2014could be seen as supportive, but the underlying message that she must excel in something might be the issue. Every teenager is different; some may not have clear interests yet, and that's normal. The parent might not realize that Ellie's interests could develop over time without external pressure.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's point of view, feeling called controlling despite the parent's claims of not being so is a red flag. It might indicate that the parent's actions, even if well-intentioned, are infringing on her autonomy. The parent's insistence on her being \"the best or at least good\" could be imposing their own values rather than respecting Ellie's path.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's often debated whether parents should push their children towards achievements. Some argue it prepares them for life, while others stress the importance of intrinsic motivation. The parent's approach might not account for Ellie's personal goals or stress levels, leading to potential resentment or disengagement.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the parent's intention is understandable, but their method might be problematic. The daughter's reaction highlights the conflict between parental expectations and teenage autonomy. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's current lack of interest and for imposing expectations that could be stressful.\n"
