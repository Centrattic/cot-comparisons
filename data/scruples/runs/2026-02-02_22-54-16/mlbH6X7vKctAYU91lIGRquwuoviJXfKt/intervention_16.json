And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't interested in anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. They've tried introducing various activities but she refuses and calls them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific activities but just want her to find something she's good at.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the context. At 15, teenagers are often exploring their interests. It's normal for some to not have found a passion yet. The parent's desire for their child to have hobbies or excel in something might stem from wanting their child to be well-rounded or have achievements. But the approach here is important. The parents are pushing Ellie to engage in activities, which she's resisting. They say they're letting her choose, but the underlying expectation is that she must be \"good at something.\" That pressure could be causing stress.\n\nThe daughter feels controlled, which is a significant point. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, the perception of control can lead to rebellion. The parent's reasoning is that doing nothing isn't acceptable, but maybe the daughter is going through a phase where she's figuring things out. It's possible the parents' expectations are too high without considering her autonomy. Also, the parent's frustration about her lack of involvement is valid, but the method of addressing it might be the issue. They might not be in the wrong, but their approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. I think it's more about whether their actions are harmful. If they're pressuring her into activities she doesn't like, that could be the issue. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, but generally, respecting a teenager's autonomy while encouraging exploration is key. So maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but their approach might be. But the question is if they are in the wrong. The daughter's feelings here matter. If the parents are causing her to feel controlled, even if their intentions are good, that's a problem. So the answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the approach is pressuring her, leading to resentment. Alternatively, if the parent's intent is to help her find her path, then maybe B. But the daughter's reaction suggests the method is off. So leaning towards A.\n"
