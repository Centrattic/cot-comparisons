And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents argue they're not pushing her into specific things but want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. At 15, teenagers are often figuring out their interests and passions. It's a time of self-exploration. The parents might feel concerned because they don't want her to be \"aimless,\" but pushing for excellence in any area can be stressful. The parent's approach is to let her choose, but still insist on participation. However, the daughter feels controlled, which is a common issue in parent-child dynamics where kids perceive pressure even if it's not overt.\n\nNext, the parents' motivation is to help their daughter develop skills and hobbies, which is understandable. However, the method of introducing her to everything and expecting her to be good at something might be overwhelming. It's possible that the daughter isn't finding her passion yet, and the pressure might hinder her from exploring freely. The line between support and control can be thin here. If the parents are enforcing participation without respecting her autonomy, that could be problematic. The daughter calling them controlling suggests that their approach isn't aligning with her needs for independence at this age.\n\nAlso, the focus on being \"the best\" or \"at least good\" at something might be adding unnecessary stress. It's important for teens to engage in activities they genuinely enjoy rather than feeling they must excel. The parents might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto their daughter. While having goals is okay, it's crucial to balance them with the child's personal interests and emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be imposing pressure that's not in line with the daughter's current stage of development. Encouraging exploration without the expectation of excellence could be more effective. The daughter's resistance indicates that the current method isn't working, so the parents might need to adjust their strategy to foster intrinsic motivation rather than external pressure. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
