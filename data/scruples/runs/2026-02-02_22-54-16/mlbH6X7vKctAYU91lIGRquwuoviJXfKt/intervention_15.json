And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable for a parent to expect from their teenager. The parent isn't forcing a specific activity but wants her to explore and find something she's good at. They mention they're letting her choose, as long as she does something. But Ellie feels pressured, leading to conflict.\n\nI think it's natural for parents to want their kids to have interests and engage in activities that build skills. However, the line between encouragement and pressure is important. The parent's approach might be seen as overbearing if Ellie feels controlled despite the parent's claims of not being controlling. At 15, teens are developing their own identities, and forcing or even strongly encouraging involvement without respecting their autonomy could be problematic.\n\nThe parent's concern about Ellie being \"aimless\" is valid, but the method of addressing it might be the issue. The key here is whether the parent is respecting Ellie's interests and personality versus imposing their own expectations. If Ellie isn't interested in any of the activities introduced, maybe there's a mismatch in how they're being presented or the types of activities chosen. The parent might not be in the wrong if their intention is to help her find a passion, but the execution could be flawed, leading to conflict.\n\nAlso, the parent's statement that doing nothing isn't acceptable might add pressure on Ellie, making her feel like she's failing if she isn't engaged. It's possible that Ellie's resistance is a reaction to this pressure, even if the parents don't intend it. The answer might hinge on whether the parent is being supportive or overly demanding. Since the parent allows her to choose, but still expects her to be good at something, there might be an underlying expectation that's causing the issue.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intentions might be good, but the way they're expressed could be contributing to Ellie's feeling controlled. The answer might be that the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but they need to adjust their approach to respect Ellie's autonomy more.\n"
