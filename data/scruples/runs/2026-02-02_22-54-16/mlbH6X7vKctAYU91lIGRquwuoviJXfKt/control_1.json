And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The parent, the author, is concerned about their 15-year-old daughter Ellie not being into anything. She's not involved in any activities, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, but they're letting her choose what that something is. They've tried introducing various activities, but Ellie resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have a hobby or something she's good at, which is a common concern for parents. They mention they're not forcing a specific activity, just pushing her to find something. But they expect her to commit and be good at it. The daughter feels pressured, even though the parents say they're not being controlling. \n\nNow, from a parenting perspective, is it wrong to expect a teenager to have some interests or activities? Teenagers often go through phases where they're less active or more into screen time. It's part of their development to explore and find their own path. The parents might be trying to encourage engagement, but if the approach is coming off as controlling, that could be the issue. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels pressured, which might mean the parents are overstepping, even if their intention is good.\n\nAlso, the part where the parents say \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" might be the problem. They might be placing too much emphasis on her being good, which could lead to stress or pressure. The daughter might need the freedom to explore without the pressure of being excellent. It's important for teens to develop intrinsic motivation rather than feeling forced by parents' expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are trying to prevent their daughter from being \"aimless,\" which is a common concern. But the method they're using\u2014introducing a lot of activities and expecting her to excel\u2014might not be the right approach. The key here is respecting the daughter's autonomy while guiding her. If the parents are not forcing specific activities but the daughter still feels controlled, maybe the way they're presenting these options is too pushy.\n\nSo, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of being good at something, even if it's not a specific activity. The daughter's right to choose not to engage in any activities might be her own decision, and the parents are not respecting that. However, the parents have a valid concern about their child's lack of engagement. The line between encouragement and control is thin here. Since the daughter is calling them controlling, and the parents are not allowing her to do nothing, it's possible the parents are overstepping, hence the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong)."
