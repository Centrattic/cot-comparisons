And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15, not into anything, average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific activities but want her to find something she's good at.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They seem concerned about Ellie's lack of direction and want her to have hobbies or skills. It's common for parents to want their kids to have interests and achievements. However, the approach here might be problematic. The parents are pressuring Ellie to engage in activities, which she's resisting. Even if they're not forcing her to do specific things, the underlying message that she must be good at something could be stressful for a teenager.\n\nTeenagers often go through phases where they're exploring who they are, and it's possible Ellie is still figuring out her interests. The parents' insistence might be making her feel controlled, leading to pushback. The key point is the balance between encouraging and pressuring. While it's reasonable to encourage exploration, making it a requirement (\"as long as she does something and is good at it\") might be too much. The parents' actions, though well-intentioned, could be infringing on Ellie's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the parents' approach is making her feel pressured, even if they believe they're giving her freedom. The parents might need to step back and let Ellie explore without the pressure of being \"good\" at something. Developmentally, adolescents need space to discover their own passions without parental expectations. The parents might be focusing on the outcome (being good at something) rather than the process of trying new things.\n\nIn summary, while the parents' concern is understandable, their approach may be too prescriptive, leading to conflict. Encouraging without forcing is key here. The answer leans towards the parents being in the wrong because their expectations might be unrealistic and not respecting Ellie's autonomy.\n"
