And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. Ellie is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to find a hobby or activity where she excels.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They mention that Ellie isn't involved in anything, and they want her to have a passion or skill. They don't specify a particular activity, so they're giving her options. However, they're introducing her to various things, which she's resisting. She's called them controlling, but they say they're not forcing her to choose a specific activity, just that she has to do something and be good at it.\n\nNow, the key points here: The parents want Ellie to be involved and excel in something, which is a common parental desire. But the way they're approaching it might be the issue. They might be imposing pressure without considering Ellie's interests or autonomy. Even if they say they're not being controlling, the daughter perceives it as such, which is a red flag. At 15, teenagers are forming their own identities, and pushing them too hard might backfire, leading to resistance and a lack of intrinsic motivation.\n\nAlso, the parents are introducing her to many activities, which could be overwhelming. It's possible that Ellie hasn't found her passion yet, and trying too many different things might not be the right approach. The parents might be focusing more on the result (being good at something) rather than supporting her process of self-discovery.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's current habits. Watching TV and being on her phone are passive activities, and the parents are concerned about her being \"aimless.\" However, not all teenagers have a clear direction at 15. Some might be going through phases or need more time to explore. The parents' approach could be pushing for external validation (being the best) rather than encouraging self-exploration.\n\nThe parents might need to reflect on why it's important for Ellie to be good at something. Is it for her own development, or for their own expectations? If they're projecting their own desires onto her, that could be problematic. The daughter's resistance and feeling controlled suggest that the approach isn't working and might be harmful to their relationship.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's possible that the parents are not malicious, but their actions are causing the daughter to feel pressured, which contradicts their claim of not being controlling. The line between guidance and control can be thin here. They might need to step back, support her interests without forcing her to excel, and allow her to find her own path without pressure.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the parents are exerting pressure that the daughter perceives as controlling, which is not healthy for her autonomy and self-discovery during adolescence.\n"
