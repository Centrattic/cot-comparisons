And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who's concerned that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've been introducing her to various activities, but Ellie is resistant and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel that it's important for Ellie to have interests and hobbies, which can contribute to her development, social skills, and future opportunities. Their intention might be to encourage her to explore and find her passion. However, the way they're approaching it could be an issue. They mention that they're letting her choose anything as long as she does something and is good at it. But Ellie perceives this as controlling. \n\nNow, considering Ellie's age, 15 is a time when teenagers often seek independence and may push back against perceived pressure from parents. The parents might not be forcing her to do specific things, but their insistence on her being \"good at something\" could be seen as pressuring her, even if they're allowing choice in the activity. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin here. \n\nThe parents might be motivated by a desire for their child to have a well-rounded life and to avoid being aimless. However, it's also important to respect the teenager's autonomy and interests. If Ellie isn't interested in any of the activities they've introduced, maybe they haven't found the right one yet, or perhaps Ellie is just going through a phase of disinterest. \n\nAnother angle is the parents' own values and their expectations. They might be projecting their own desires onto Ellie, thinking that having a hobby or talent is essential. But every child is different; some might not find their passion until later, or they might prefer different forms of engagement that aren't traditional clubs or sports. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the parents are overstepping by pressuring Ellie to excel in something, even if they let her choose the activity. The fact that Ellie feels controlled suggests that the approach might not be effective or respectful of her autonomy. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the judgment would depend on whether the parents' actions are considered overbearing despite their good intentions. While wanting the best for their child is understandable, the method of pressuring her to be good at something might be the problem. The parents might need to find a balance between encouraging exploration and respecting Ellie's current interests and pace. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the parents are in the wrong because their approach could be too controlling, even if their intentions are good. They might not be respecting Ellie's autonomy and her need for independence during adolescence.\n"
