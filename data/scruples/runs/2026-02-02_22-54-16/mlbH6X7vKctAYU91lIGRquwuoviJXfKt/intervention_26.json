And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions their daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on TV and her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and be good at something, which is a common parental desire. They\u2019re encouraging exploration but also pushing for excellence. On the other hand, the daughter is 15, a teenager who might be dealing with different pressures or just figuring out her own path. The parents might be overstepping by pressuring her to find something and excel, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nThen there's the daughter's reaction. She feels controlled even though the parents say they're not forcing specific activities. Maybe the pressure to choose something and be good at it is too much. Teenagers often resist pressure from parents, especially if it feels like it's not their choice. The parents' approach might be well-intentioned but not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter's current behavior\u2014watching TV, being on her phone\u2014might be a coping mechanism or her way of dealing with stress. If the parents are pushing her to participate in activities she's not interested in, it could lead to conflict and resentment. The parents might not be considering her personal interests or mental state.\n\nBut the parents' concern is valid. They want her to have hobbies and achieve something, which can be beneficial for her development. However, the method of introducing many activities without her input might not be effective. Maybe she hasn't found her passion yet, and the parents are pushing too hard instead of giving her space to explore on her own terms.\n\nI should also think about cultural or societal expectations. Some cultures emphasize achievement and participation in activities more than others. The parents might be projecting their own values onto their daughter without considering her individuality.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's a balance between encouraging development and respecting autonomy. The parents might be in the wrong if their approach is too controlling and not allowing the daughter to make her own choices. Even if they are trying to be open, the pressure to excel at something might still be harmful. The daughter's resistance and labeling them as controlling suggests the approach isn't working.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong. They need to respect their daughter's autonomy and find a middle ground that supports her without pressure.\n"
