And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's resistant and feels they're controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about Ellie's future and want her to have interests or skills. They feel that doing nothing is not acceptable. But Ellie is 15, a teenager, which is a time when kids start to have more autonomy. The parents are pushing her to find something, but maybe they're not respecting her need for independence. They say they're letting her choose, but the underlying message is that she has to be good at something, which could be pressure in itself.\n\nEllie's reaction is that they're controlling. Even if the parents aren't forcing specific activities, the expectation to excel in *any* area might be overwhelming. The parents might not realize that Ellie's resistance is part of her asserting her own choices. Also, expecting someone to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something can be a form of pressure. It's possible that the parents' expectations are unrealistic or not aligning with Ellie's interests or personality.\n\nAnother angle is that Ellie might not have found her passion yet. At 15, it's not uncommon for teens to be exploring. The parents' approach of introducing her to many activities might be overwhelming. Instead of pushing for excellence, maybe they should encourage exploration without the pressure of being good. The key issue here is the parents' insistence on her being good at something versus her right to choose her own path without pressure.\n\nThe parents might also be projecting their own values or regrets onto Ellie. They might fear she's not preparing adequately for the future, but that doesn't mean their approach is right. The daughter's current habits don't necessarily define her future, and pushing her could lead to resentment or burnout.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamic, the parents are trying to do what they think is right for their child, but the method might be the problem. The daughter feels controlled, and the parents feel they're being reasonable. But the line between guidance and control can be blurry. Since the parents are allowing her to choose the activity but expecting excellence, the pressure is there. That could be why the daughter feels controlled even if the parents don't see themselves that way.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because their expectations and approach might be too controlling, not respecting Ellie's autonomy and current situation. However, there's a balance because parents do have a role in encouraging their children. But the way they're enforcing it here might be the issue.\n"
