And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't involved in anything, just watching Netflix and using her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parent wants her to excel at something, even if they don't specify what, as long as she's good at it. They argue they're not forcing her into a specific activity, just expecting her to choose and excel.\n\nSo, the key points here: The parent's concern is about their child being inactive and not having hobbies. They're pushing for her to be good at something, which is a common parental desire. But the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often develop their own identities and may resist pressure from parents. The parent is introducing her to various activities, which could be seen as support, but the daughter feels it's controlling. The parent's reasoning is that doing nothing is unacceptable, so they want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nNow, considering whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, encouraging children to explore activities and find their interests is normal. On the other hand, if the child is feeling pressured and it's leading to conflict, especially if the parent is emphasizing the need to be \"the best\" or \"good\" rather than just participating for fun, that could be problematic. The parent is allowing her to choose the activity, but the underlying expectation of excellence might still be a form of pressure. The daughter's reaction as feeling controlled suggests that the approach isn't working, even if the parent's intention is good.\n\nThe parent's stance is that doing nothing is unacceptable, but maybe they're not considering that Ellie's current state might be a phase, or that she might not be interested in traditional \"good at something\" activities. Also, expecting her to excel might be unrealistic without her intrinsic motivation. The parent's actions could be stifling Ellie's autonomy, which is crucial during adolescence. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for parents to have high expectations, but the manner in which these expectations are imposed matters. If the daughter is being pushed into trying too many activities without finding what she genuinely enjoys, it could lead to resentment. The parent might not be in the wrong per se, but their approach might be flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether pressuring a teenager to excel in something they aren't interested in is inappropriate. \n\nIn many cases, experts advise supporting children in exploring their interests without imposing high expectations for success. The parent's focus on being good at something might be more about their own desires or societal pressures rather than Ellie's well-being. So, the parent's insistence could be seen as overstepping, hence them being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the parent is in the wrong).\n"
