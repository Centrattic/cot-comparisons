And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent says their daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV or uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. They want her to be good at something, but she's not choosing anything.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider typical teenage behavior. At 15, many teens do go through phases of not being interested in a lot of things. It's part of exploring identity. Maybe she's just finding her interests yet. The parents want her to be involved, which is common for parents wanting their kids to have skills or hobbies. But pushing too hard could backfire. The daughter feels controlled, even if the parents are trying to let her choose. The key issue is whether the parents are being controlling by expecting her to excel in something without her own motivation.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" might imply pressure. If they're pressuring her to be good, that could be problematic. Maybe they should focus on her interest rather than proficiency. The daughter might need time to find her passion without the pressure of being the best. Parents have good intentions, but the approach might be too demanding. So, the answer would likely be A, the parent is in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without considering the daughter's autonomy and natural interests.\n"
