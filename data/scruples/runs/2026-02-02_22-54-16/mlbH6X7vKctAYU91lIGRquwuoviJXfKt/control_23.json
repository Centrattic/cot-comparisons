And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel in something. The daughter is 15, not involved in activities, and the parents feel she's aimless. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, the parents want her to be good at something, which is a common parental desire. They mention letting her choose but want her to commit and be good. The key here is whether their expectations are reasonable. At 15, teens often explore different interests. It's normal for some to not have found their passion yet. The parents might be pushing for achievement, which can be stressful for the teen. \n\nThe daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests she feels pressured. The parents say they aren't forcing specific activities but want her to commit to something. However, the way they phrase it\u2014expecting her to be the best or at least good\u2014might be the issue. High expectations can backfire, leading to anxiety or resentment. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) aren't inherently bad. It's important to respect her autonomy. Pushing for extracurriculars might not consider her interests or that she's still figuring things out. The parents might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be seen as lacking understanding of her developmental stage. They might need to balance expectations with allowing her to explore at her own pace without pressure to excel immediately. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the pressure to excel and the lack of acceptance of her current state could be harmful.\n"
