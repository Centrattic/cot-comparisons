And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent feels that their daughter is aimless, not involved in any activities, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents aren't forcing specific interests but want her to choose something and excel at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the daughter. At 15, she's a teenager, which is a time when many people explore their interests and start developing hobbies or passions. It's common for teens to go through phases of trying out different activities. The parents' concern might stem from wanting to see their child have direction and skills, which is a common parental desire. However, the daughter's resistance is significant. She's calling her parents controlling, which suggests she feels pressured even if they aren't dictating specific choices. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or if their expectations are reasonable.\n\nThe parents mention that they let her choose what she does, as long as she does something and is good at it. But the daughter might not feel that she has true autonomy. Maybe she feels that the parents are pushing for excellence, which can be stressful. Also, the parents are disappointed in her current state of not being involved. It's possible that the daughter is in a different stage of development where she hasn't found her passion yet, and the parents' expectations might not align with her current reality. \n\nThere's also the aspect of extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation. The parents want her to be good at something, but if she's not intrinsically motivated, she might not sustain the activity. Expecting her to be the best might be placing a lot of pressure on her, which could lead to burnout or resentment. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling indicates that she perceives the pressure, even if it's not overt.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, parental push for children to excel is more accepted, while in others, it's seen as overbearing. The question doesn't specify cultural context, but generally, the right to self-determination is important. The daughter's right to choose her own path without pressure is a factor here.\n\nThe parents' actions might be well-intentioned, but they could be overlooking their daughter's need for autonomy. Even if they're not forcing her into specific activities, the expectation that she must be good at something might be a form of subtle pressure. The daughter's current state of not participating in activities might be due to lack of interest or maybe anxiety about not meeting expectations. The parents' frustration is valid, but their approach might be contributing to the daughter's resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have reasonable concerns about their daughter's development, their expectation that she must excel in something, and the pressure they're exerting, might be the issue. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels controlled, which could mean the parents are in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy and interests, even if their intention is good.\n"
