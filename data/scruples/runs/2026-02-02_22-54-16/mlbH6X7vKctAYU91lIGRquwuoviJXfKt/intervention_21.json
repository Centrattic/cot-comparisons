And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she doesn't participate in any activities. They've tried introducing her to various things but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have interests and excel in something, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels pressured, leading to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, an age where teens often explore their own identities. Pressuring her to excel might stifle her autonomy. The parents' approach could be seen as controlling if they're pushing her towards any activity just to have her be \"good\" at something, regardless of her actual interests. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests that the approach isn't working and might be causing stress.\n\nI should also think about healthy development. Encouraging hobbies is positive, but forcing or pressuring a teenager to be the best might not be. The key is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy while guiding her. The parents say they let her choose, but the underlying expectation of being \"the best\" might be the issue. It's possible that the daughter feels the pressure to meet their expectations rather than finding her own passions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parents have good intentions but might be misapplying their approach. The daughter's resistance indicates that the current method isn't effective. The answer might hinge on balance between support and pressure. If the parents are pushing without understanding Ellie's interests, they could be in the wrong. But if they're genuinely trying to help her find her path, it's more nuanced. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're expecting excellence without considering her preferences, maybe A (yes) is the answer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B (no) if they're just encouraging without forcing. Hmm.\n"
