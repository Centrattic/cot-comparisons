And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent feels Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to be good at something, as doing nothing isn't acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have direction and hobbies, which is a common parental concern. They're trying to encourage her by exposing her to different options, which might be a proactive approach. But the daughter feels controlled, even though the parents say they're not pressuring her into specific activities. \n\nNow, the teenager's perspective is important. At 15, she's in a stage where identity and autonomy are crucial. If she's pushing back, maybe she feels her parents aren't respecting her choices. The parents want her to be good at something, but forcing or pressuring might backfire, leading to resistance. The daughter's calling them controlling suggests there's a communication gap.\n\nI should think about whether the parents are overstepping. If they're not dictating specific activities but emphasizing the need for her to find something, maybe they're not being controlling. But expecting her to be \"the best\" might set unrealistic expectations. It's possible that the parents aren't wrong in wanting their child to have interests and skills, but the approach might be lacking. The daughter's autonomy is a key factor here. The parents might not be in the wrong, but their method could be improved by listening more to Ellie's preferences and giving her space to explore without pressure. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the note that their approach could be adjusted. However, based on the question's binary choice, the answer is likely B.\n"
