And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The parent, let's call them AITA, is concerned about their 15-year-old daughter Ellie. She's not into anything\u2014her grades are average, she doesn't participate in any school activities, and she spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, even if it's not what they were good at. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resisting and calling them controlling.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that they want her to have some passion or skill, not just be aimless. They mention that they don't force her to choose the same things they liked but want her to commit to something she's good at. The daughter feels controlled, but the parents say they're not being pushy.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the parents are wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests and skills, which can be beneficial for development. Encouraging participation in activities can build confidence and social skills. But the daughter is 15 and might have her own reasons for not engaging. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's autonomy. The daughter's reaction\u2014calling them controlling\u2014suggests that the pressure is affecting her negatively.\n\nIs it wrong to want your child to have interests and skills? Maybe not inherently, but the approach matters. The parents say they're letting her choose but require her to do something and be good at it. That sounds like they're setting a condition: you have to do something, and you have to be good at it. That could be seen as controlling because they're not accepting her current interests. They might not realize that Ellie's current activities (TV, phone) are her way of dealing with things, and pushing her to do other things might be invalidating her.\n\nAlso, at 15, teenagers are figuring out who they are. Forcing them into activities without considering their preferences could lead to resentment. The parents might not be considering Ellie's perspective. They mention introducing her to many things, but maybe she's not into any of them. It's possible she needs different approaches or more time. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus pushing their own desires onto her.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some cultures emphasize achievement and participation in extracurriculars, while others are more laid-back. The parents might be coming from a mindset that values these activities, but if the daughter isn't interested, it's a conflict of values. The parents' insistence on her being \"good at something\" might not account for her personality or interests. They might be projecting their own expectations rather than supporting Ellie's own path.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter's average grades and lack of involvement could indicate other issues. Maybe she's struggling socially, dealing with anxiety, or just not finding the right fit. The parents' approach of trying multiple activities without success might mean they're not finding the right match for her. Instead of pushing her to be good at something, maybe they should support her current interests and help her explore more meaningfully.\n\nThe line between encouragement and control is thin here. If the parents are creating a requirement that she must be good at something, that's more controlling. If they're offering support and options without pressure, that's different. But from the description, it seems like they're expecting her to commit to something and be good at it, which might not be in her best interest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their insistence on Ellie being good at something and labeling her as aimless might be inconsiderate of her autonomy and individuality. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Ellie's choices and autonomy, even under the guise of encouragement.\n"
