And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the parent) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. The parent feels Ellie isn't into anything, just watching TV and on her phone, and they've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want Ellie to have interests and excel in something, which they see as important for her development. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. Their concern is that she's aimless and not engaged in anything productive.\n\nNow, the daughter's side. At 15, she's in adolescence, a time when teens often experiment with identity and autonomy. If the parents are pressuring her to be good at something, even if they're not dictating what, it could feel like pressure. The daughter feels controlled, which suggests that the parents' approach isn't resonating with her. The parents think they're being supportive, but the daughter's reaction indicates conflict.\n\nNext, societal norms and parenting styles. Some parents encourage their kids to explore and find their passions, while others push for achievements. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. The parents here might be overstepping by expecting excellence in any area, possibly not respecting Ellie's autonomy to explore or decide not to engage in certain activities.\n\nAlso, considering mental health. Constant pressure to excel can lead to stress, anxiety, or burnout in teens. If Ellie isn't interested in any activities, forcing her to find something might backfire. It's important for teens to have time for leisure and self-discovery without adult-imposed goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have valid concerns about their daughter's lack of direction. However, the approach matters. Instead of expecting her to be \"good at something,\" maybe supporting her in exploring her interests without the pressure of excellence could be better. The key is balance between guidance and autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are to help Ellie find her path, their method might be too prescriptive, leading to the daughter feeling controlled. The expectation of being \"the best\" might be unrealistic and not considering Ellie's interests. Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy and current lack of interest.\n"
