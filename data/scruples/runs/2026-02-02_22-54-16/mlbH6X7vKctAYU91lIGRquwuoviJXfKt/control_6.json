And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't involved in anything, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling. The key here is whether the parents' expectations are reasonable or if they're overstepping.\n\nFirst, every parent wants their child to have interests and skills. It's natural to hope they find something they're good at. But the daughter is 15, an adolescent, which is a time when teens often explore and experiment. It's possible she hasn't found her passion yet. The parents are pushing for her to be \"good at something,\" but they might not be respecting her autonomy. Even though they're offering choices, the pressure to excel in any area might be too much. \n\nThe daughter calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if the parents think they're not being restrictive. The line between encouragement and control can be thin. If the parents are insisting she must be good at something without considering her preferences or the stress it might cause, that's problematic. Adolescents need space to discover their interests without parental pressure. \n\nAdditionally, average grades and lack of extracurriculars don't necessarily mean a problem. Some kids thrive in different ways. The parents might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto their child. It's important to consider the daughter's well-being and whether the pressure could lead to anxiety or resentment. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents' intentions might be good, but their approach could be harmful. They might be in the wrong if they're not allowing their daughter the freedom to explore at her own pace without the pressure to excel. The answer would lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because the focus on being \"good at something\" might be too controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n"
