And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned because she's not into anything, her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. They've tried introducing her to various things but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing her to do specific things, just want her to find and be good at something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and be engaged, which is a common parental desire. They might feel that having a hobby or skill is important for her development. But the daughter is a teenager, a time when autonomy is crucial. The parents might be pushing her, even if unintentionally, which could make her feel controlled. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' intentions versus the daughter's perception. The parents claim they're not being controlling, just wanting her to choose something and excel. However, the daughter feels controlled. There's a difference between wanting to encourage a child and imposing expectations. The parents might not realize that pressuring her to be \"the best\" or \"good at something\" could come across as another form of control, even if they're giving her choices. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current behavior\u2014watching TV and using her phone\u2014might be her way of coping or finding comfort. The parents might not be considering her personal preferences or the possibility that she's exploring her interests at her own pace. Teenagers often go through phases where they experiment with activities before finding something they genuinely enjoy. \n\nAnother angle is the idea of what \"being good at something\" means. The parents might equate having a skill with success or fulfillment, but that's not always the case. The daughter might have different values or ways of finding satisfaction. The parents' emphasis on excelling could be setting up a scenario where she feels like a failure if she doesn't meet those expectations, which is not healthy.\n\nIn terms of ethics, are the parents wrong? It's a gray area. They have good intentions but their approach might be harmful. The daughter's reaction indicates that their methods are causing conflict. The parents might need to reflect on their parenting style, perhaps being more supportive without the pressure to excel. It's possible they're not in the wrong entirely but could be overstepping by not respecting her autonomy as much as they think.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the parents are imposing their expectations under the guise of choice, which the daughter perceives as controlling. They need to consider her autonomy and find a balance between encouragement and pressure.\n"
