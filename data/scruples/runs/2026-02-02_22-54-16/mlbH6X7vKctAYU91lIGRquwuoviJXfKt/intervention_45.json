And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned she's not into anything, just watching TV and on her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's not into them and called them controlling.\n\nHmm, the parents want her to be good at something, any something. They say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. The daughter feels controlled. The user thinks the parent is not wrong. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests and skills. It's common to encourage extracurriculars. But on the other hand, pushing too hard can backfire. The daughter is 15, an adolescent, and might be feeling pressure. The parents are letting her choose, but the underlying message might be that she must choose something and be good at it. The daughter's resistance could be due to feeling forced despite the parents' approach. \n\nAlso, the parents might not be respecting the daughter's autonomy. Even if they're not dictating specifics, the expectation that she must excel in something they introduce could be controlling. Adolescents need space to explore without pressure. Maybe the parents are overstepping by labeling \"doing nothing\" as unacceptable, not considering that the daughter might be going through a phase or finding her own interests outside what the parents offer. \n\nThe key here is the daughter's reaction. If she feels controlled, that's a red flag. The parents' approach might be well-intentioned but could be infringing on the daughter's need for independence. So, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong because they're imposing expectations under the guise of choice.\n"
