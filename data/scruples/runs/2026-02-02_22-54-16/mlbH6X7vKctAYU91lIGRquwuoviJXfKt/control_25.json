And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parent wants her to be good at something, but the daughter isn't interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel worried about their daughter's future, not having hobbies or interests could lead to social or academic challenges. Their intention is to encourage her to develop skills, which is a common parental concern. However, the daughter is a teenager, so autonomy is important. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. However, the daughter perceives this as controlling, which is a red flag. \n\nPushing a child to be \"the best\" might create pressure and resentment. At 15, teens are often figuring out their own interests. The parent's approach might be too rigid, not allowing the daughter to explore at her own pace. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels pressured, which could harm her intrinsic motivation. Also, the parent mentions she's average in school, which could be a concern, but pushing for extracurriculars might not address academic issues unless linked.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's expectations might not align with the daughter's natural inclinations. Some people find their passion later, or have different definitions of success. The parent's emphasis on being \"good\" could stem from their own values, but it's possible they're projecting their own desires onto their child. The daughter's lack of engagement might indicate her interests lie elsewhere, or she's struggling with self-motivation, which could be due to various factors like anxiety or lack of interest.\n\nThe key issue is the pressure to excel versus allowing the child to explore without pressure. The parent might not be in the \"wrong\" entirely, as they have valid concerns, but their approach could be too controlling. The daughter's feelings of being controlled suggest the method is problematic. It's a balance between encouragement and pressure. The parent needs to respect her autonomy while guiding her, maybe through open dialogue instead of pushing for excellence.\n"
