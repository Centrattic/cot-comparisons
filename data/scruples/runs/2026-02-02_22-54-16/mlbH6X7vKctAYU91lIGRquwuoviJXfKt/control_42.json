And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully again.\n\nThe parent is a woman whose daughter, Ellie, is 15. Ellie isn't into anything\u2014average grades, doesn't participate in any activities at school or home, just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, any something, and they've tried introducing her to various activities like sports, art, instruments, etc. Ellie called them controlling, but the parent argues that they're not forcing her to do any specific thing, just want her to choose something and be good at it because doing nothing isn't acceptable.\n\nSo the parent is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's reasonable. Parents often have high hopes for their kids, but pushing too hard can backfire. The key points here are the parents' approach. They mention they're not forcing her to do what they did, just encouraging her to do something. However, the daughter feels controlled, which is a significant red flag.\n\nThe parents might be projecting their own values onto Ellie. Maybe they think having a hobby or being good at something is essential for success or a well-rounded life. But adolescence is a time when teens explore their interests. If Ellie isn't interested in any of the activities they've introduced, maybe they're not considering her personality or what she actually likes. Forcing her to choose something might not work if she's not intrinsically motivated.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be concerned about her lack of direction. It's common for teens to be indecisive, but if the parents are pressuring her without understanding her interests, that's a problem. The parent says they're letting her choose anything, but the daughter feels controlled. That discrepancy suggests that their approach might be too rigid, even if they think they're giving her freedom.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 15, which is still young. Some teens take longer to find their passions. The parents' insistence on being \"the best\" or \"good\" at something might be setting unrealistic expectations. Maybe they're focusing on achievement rather than exploration. It's possible the daughter isn't into any of the suggested activities because they don't align with her interests, and the parents are not listening to her.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are using guilt or pressure, which can harm the parent-child relationship. The daughter calling them controlling indicates she feels pressured. Even if the parents mean well, the method matters. Encouragement vs. pressure is a thin line. If they're not allowing her to have free time without judgment, that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some cultures emphasize children pursuing excellence, but others prioritize happiness and personal choice. The parents might be operating from a place of wanting their child to have opportunities, but if the child is unhappy, that's a concern.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The parents are concerned about their daughter's future and want her to have skills or achievements. They are trying to help her find a path. However, the approach is the issue here. The daughter's autonomy and happiness should be considered. Pushing her might lead to resistance, as seen here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach may be too controlling. The daughter's reaction suggests they're not respecting her autonomy. The parents should focus on supporting her interests rather than imposing their own expectations. The answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because their method is controlling, not allowing the daughter to explore naturally, and the pressure is causing conflict.\n"
