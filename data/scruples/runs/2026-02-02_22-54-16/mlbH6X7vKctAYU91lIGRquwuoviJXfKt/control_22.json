And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter is 15, not into anything, average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents are pushing for her to find a hobby or activity where she can excel, but the daughter is resistant and feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have direction and not be aimless. That's a common concern for parents, wanting their kids to have interests and skills. But the approach they're taking might be problematic. They mention introducing her to various activities, but she doesn't want to do any of them. The daughter feels controlled, even though the parents say they aren't forcing specific activities. However, the underlying pressure to be \"good at something\" could be the issue. \n\nIt's important to think about the daughter's autonomy. At 15, she's developing her own identity. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering her interests or the reasons she isn't into activities. Maybe she's not interested in the ones they've tried, or perhaps she's not ready to commit. Also, the parents are using phrases like \"we want her to be the best\" which could come across as pressuring her. \n\nAnother angle is the daughter's current behavior\u2014using her phone and TV. The parents might see this as a problem, but teens often use screen time as a way to cope or socialize. The parents might not be addressing why she's not engaging in other activities. It could be anxiety, social issues, or lack of interest in the options presented.\n\nAlso, the parents mention they want her to be good at something, but they don't specify if they're being supportive or if there's an expectation of achievement. If the focus is on being \"the best,\" that could add stress instead of encouraging exploration. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents do have a role in guiding their children, but pushing too hard can backfire. The daughter calling them controlling suggests that their approach is making her feel pressured, which might be counterproductive. The parents might need to step back and find a balance between encouraging exploration and respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach could be too controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy. They might need to adjust their expectations and find ways to support her in discovering her own interests without pressure.\n"
