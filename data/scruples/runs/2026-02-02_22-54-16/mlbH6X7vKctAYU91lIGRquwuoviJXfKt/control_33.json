And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The daughter isn't into any activities, just watches TV and uses her phone. The parents have tried various activities but she's resistant, labeling them as controlling.\n\nFirst, the parents' intention is to want their child to have a hobby or skill. That's understandable, as parents often hope their kids develop interests. But the key issue here is the pressure they're putting on her. The parents are saying she needs to be \"the best\" or at least good at something, which sounds more about their expectations than her own interests.\n\nThe daughter is 15, an age where adolescents start asserting their independence. Forcing or pressuring them can backfire, leading to resistance and conflict. The parents mention they're not dictating what she should do, but they're insisting she must be good at *something*. Even if the method is to offer options, the underlying message might still be that she needs to meet the parents' standards, which can feel controlling regardless of the approach.\n\nAlso, the daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests that she feels the pressure, even if the parents think they're being supportive. The parents might not realize how their expectations are affecting her. The fact that the daughter is described as \"aimless\" by the parents could be more about the parents' dissatisfaction than the actual situation. Not every teenager has to have intense hobbies; some may be more introverted or not interested in traditional activities.\n\nIn terms of the parents' actions: introducing her to various activities is a good effort, but if she's not interested and they're pushing for her to be good at something, they might be overstepping. The pressure to excel can lead to stress and resentment. The parents might need to accept that their child has different priorities or that she's going through a phase where she doesn't feel motivated yet. \n\nIt's important for parents to support their child's autonomy and interests rather than imposing their own desires. If the parents are more focused on their own values of achievement rather than their daughter's happiness or personal growth, that's where the problem lies. So, the answer is likely A (the parents are in the wrong) because their expectations are not respecting the daughter's autonomy and current interests, which can harm their relationship and the daughter's self-esteem.\n"
