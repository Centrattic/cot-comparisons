And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parent argues that they're not forcing specific activities but want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have direction and hobbies, which is a common concern for parents. They're trying different things to find what she likes. But then there's the question of whether this pressure is healthy. At 15, teenagers are exploring their interests, and pushing for excellence might stifle her self-discovery. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if the parents think they're not being restrictive.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies an expectation of competence, which could be problematic. Adolescents might feel stressed to perform, leading to resistance. The parents might not be forcing specific activities, but the underlying message that she must excel in something might be overwhelming. It's a balance between encouraging engagement without imposing performance standards.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about their child's future and want her to develop skills and interests. Their approach of trying various activities is a way to help her find her passion. However, the key issue is whether their expectations are reasonable. Teenagers often go through phases of not having clear interests, and some take longer to discover their passions. The parents' insistence on \"being the best\" might not align with the child's natural development timeline.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some cultures place a high value on extracurricular achievements, which might influence the parents' expectations. But from a psychological standpoint, allowing a teenager space to explore without pressure is important for their self-esteem and autonomy. The daughter's resistance could be a sign that she's feeling over-pressured, even if the parents don't intend it that way.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parents might be in the wrong by imposing an expectation of excellence in any activity, which could be controlling and counterproductive. The daughter's well-being and autonomy should be prioritized, even if the parents' intentions are good.\n"
