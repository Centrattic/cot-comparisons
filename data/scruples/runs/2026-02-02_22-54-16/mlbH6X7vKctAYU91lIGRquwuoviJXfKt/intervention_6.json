And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who's concerned that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything. Her grades are average, and she doesn't do much at home except watch TV and use her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, music, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing her to do anything specific, just that she has to be into something and be good at it.\n\nHmm, the user initially thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests and hobbies, which can be beneficial for development. But on the other hand, the way they're approaching it might be problematic. The daughter is 15, which is a time when kids are figuring out their own identities. If the parents are pressuring her to be good at something without her own interest, that could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe parents mention they're letting her choose anything, as long as she does something and is good at it. But the daughter feels pressured. It's possible that the constant introduction to activities without her consent might feel like a form of control. Also, the emphasis on being \"the best\" or \"good\" might be adding stress, making her resistant.\n\nI should consider whether the parents' expectations are reasonable. It's normal to want children to have engaging activities, but the key is how they approach it. If they're creating an environment where the daughter feels forced to excel in something without her own motivation, that could be the issue. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that their approach is causing conflict.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the daughter is going through a phase where she's disinterested, and the parents' push might not account for that. At 15, teenagers often experiment with different interests, and not every activity will stick. The parents might need to give her space to explore without the pressure of being good at it. The focus on being \"good\" might be counterproductive if it's making her reluctant to participate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents have good intentions but might be applying pressure inadvertently. The daughter's feelings about being controlled indicate that the parents' methods are causing distress. So the answer might hinge on whether the parents are overstepping by pushing for excellence in any area without respecting the daughter's current interests and pace. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their expectations and methods could be too controlling, even if they think they're not.\n"
