And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent feels their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parent says they aren't forcing specific interests but want her to do something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their child to have some direction and not be aimless. That's a common concern for parents. But the approach here might be an issue. The parent mentions they're not controlling, but the daughter feels that way. Pushing for her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something might create pressure. At 15, teens are exploring their interests, and forcing them might lead to resistance.\n\nThe key points here: the parent is trying to nudge the daughter into finding a passion, but the daughter feels controlled. The parent isn't forcing specific activities but is emphasizing that she must do something and be good at it. The problem might be the parent's expectation of excellence and the lack of understanding that the daughter might not have found her passion yet. Teens often go through phases where they experiment with different activities before finding something they truly enjoy. The parent's insistence on being \"good\" could be stifling her natural exploration.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests there's a conflict in communication. The parent's approach might not be respecting the daughter's autonomy, even if they think they're giving her choices. The pressure to be good at something might not be the right focus. It's possible the parent is in the wrong because they're imposing their own expectations of success or engagement onto their child without considering her individual path or readiness.\n\nOn the other hand, wanting the child to be engaged and not idle isn't inherently wrong. However, the method matters. The parent needs to balance encouragement without pressure, supporting her in exploring without expecting immediate excellence. So, the answer might lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because the approach could be too controlling and not respecting the daughter's personal development timeline.\n"
