And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents feel she's aimless. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and be good at something, which they see as important for her development. They mention not forcing specific activities but encouraging her to choose something. However, the daughter feels pressured and labels them as controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's response suggests she's not interested in any of the activities they've offered. Maybe she's not into the things they've tried. The parents might not be considering her actual interests or that she's going through a phase typical for teenagers. Teenagers often experiment with different activities and might not have found their passion yet. \n\nThe key point here is the balance between parental guidance and respecting the child's autonomy. The parents are pushing for involvement and excellence, which they see as positive, but the daughter feels their approach is overbearing. The fact that they've tried multiple activities but she still isn't engaged might indicate that the problem isn't her lack of interest but perhaps the wrong fit. \n\nAlso, the parents' requirement that she be \"good at something\" could be part of the issue. It's one thing to encourage participation in activities for personal growth, but expecting excellence might create pressure. The daughter might be feeling forced to meet their expectations rather than exploring her own interests.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is causing stress and resentment without considering the daughter's preferences. However, their concern is valid in wanting her to have direction. But the method\u2014introducing a variety of activities and setting a standard of being \"good\"\u2014might be too rigid. \n\nI think the parents are overstepping by not allowing the daughter to find her own path without the pressure of being the best. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their expectations could be contributing to the daughter's resistance. They need to respect her autonomy and explore her own interests without the pressure of excelling.\n"
