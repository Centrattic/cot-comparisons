And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent in the AITA story is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent, Ellie's mom or co-parent, is concerned because Ellie isn't involved in any activities, her grades are average, and she's just watching Netflix and using her phone. They've tried exposing her to various activities but she resists, even calling them controlling. The parents want Ellie to be good at something, not necessarily a specific thing, but they want her to engage in something and commit to it. They aren't forcing specific activities but are pushing the idea that she needs to do something and be good at it. The daughter is 15.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A or B.\n\nHmm. In AITA (Am I the Asshole) stories, the key is to assess whether the asker's actions are unreasonable or overstepping. The parents want their daughter to have a hobby or pursuit where she can excel. But their approach is causing conflict. They're introducing her to various activities, but she's not interested. The daughter feels controlled, even if the parents aren't forcing specific choices. The parents are allowing her to choose but expect her to choose something and be good at it. The daughter might feel pressured even if it's not explicit. \n\nExpecting a child to be good at something is common, but it's important to consider the child's autonomy. At 15, Ellie is in a stage where finding her own interests is part of her development. Pushing too hard might lead to resistance. The parents might not be \"controlling\" in the traditional sense, but their expectations could be seen as pressuring her to conform to their standards. The daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests she feels the pressure, even if the parents don't mean to be. \n\nAlso, the parents are not allowing her to do nothing. They might be overstepping by not accepting that she might not be interested in any of the activities they're offering. Maybe their daughter is going through a phase where she's not motivated, and the parents' insistence is adding stress. The key here is whether the parents are respecting their daughter's autonomy vs. pushing their own desires onto her. \n\nIn AITA, the line between reasonable concern and overstepping is often thin. The parents have good intentions, but their methods might be causing more harm. The daughter's reaction is a sign that the pressure is there. So, maybe the parents are in the wrong (A) because they are imposing their expectations without considering the daughter's interests or stress. Alternatively, if the parents are just encouraging and not forcing, maybe not (B). But the daughter says they're \"controlling,\" which implies she feels manipulated or pressured despite the parents' claims. \n\nI think the answer here is A because the parents are not respecting the daughter's lack of interest and the resulting conflict is their fault. They're framing it as allowing her to choose, but their insistence that she must do something and be good at it could be seen as controlling. The daughter's aimlessness might be a natural part of her development, and the parents are pressuring her into something they want for her identity or their own standards. So the answer is A.\n"
