And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel in something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends time on her phone and Netflix. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant, even calling them controlling. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want Ellie to be good at something, which could be for her future success or personal development. But is pushing for excellence inherently wrong? Well, every child is different. Some kids thrive under encouragement, others might feel pressured. The parent says they're letting her choose what she does, but they still have an expectation of being \"good at it.\" That might be the issue. The daughter feels controlled even though the parents think they're being supportive. \n\nAlso, at 15, teenagers are exploring their interests and identities. Maybe Ellie isn't into anything yet, which is normal. Pressuring her to excel might stifle her natural interests. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto her. They might not realize that not being into anything right now doesn't mean she's not capable later. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents could be trying to encourage her to find a passion. But the way they're approaching it might be too forceful. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that their methods are not resonating well. It's possible that instead of pushing for excellence, they should be supporting her in trying different things without the pressure of being the best. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They have good intentions but might be applying too much pressure. The line between encouragement and control can be thin. If the parents are making her feel that she must excel in something specific, that's problematic. However, if they're just encouraging exploration without the pressure of being the best, that's different. The current situation seems to have the parents expecting excellence in any chosen activity, which might be the root of the conflict. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong by imposing their expectations, even if they're trying to help.\n"
