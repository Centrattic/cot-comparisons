And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter, Ellie, is 15 and isn't into any activities. The parents are pushing her to be \"the best\" or at least good at something, even though they say they're not forcing specific choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They mention that Ellie isn't involved in anything and that they're concerned about her being \"aimless.\" They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents argue they're not controlling but want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the pressure to be the best. Even if they're not forcing specific activities, expecting her to be good at something might be unrealistic. Every teenager is different. Some find their passion later, others might not be into traditional activities. The parents' approach might be pushing Ellie towards stress or burnout instead of allowing her to explore her own interests naturally.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the parents' methods are causing tension. The parents might not be considering Ellie's autonomy and personal interests. While it's good to encourage engagement, the parents' emphasis on excellence and constant pushing could be counterproductive. They might be projecting their own expectations rather than supporting Ellie's unique path.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about their daughter's lack of involvement, which is a valid worry. But the way they're addressing it\u2014by expecting her to be the best in something\u2014might be the issue. The problem isn't the desire for her to have interests but the pressure to excel. The right approach would be to support exploration without the burden of being the best. Therefore, the parents are in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations rather than fostering her own interests.\n"
