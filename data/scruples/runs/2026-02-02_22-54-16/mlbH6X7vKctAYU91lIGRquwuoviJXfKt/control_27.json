And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent is frustrated because their 15-year-old, Ellie, isn't into anything\u2014average grades, no extracurriculars, just watching TV and using her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They want Ellie to have interests and hobbies, which is a common parental desire. But the approach here might be the issue. The parent mentions they're not forcing specific activities from their own past but are pushing for her to be \"good at something.\" The key point is that while they're allowing her to choose, they still expect her to commit to something and be good at it. \n\nEllie's age is important. At 15, teenagers are figuring out their identities. Pressuring them to excel might be counterproductive. The parent's frustration is valid\u2014they want their child to have direction. However, the daughter's resistance and labeling them as controlling suggests that the pressure might be perceived as overbearing, even if the intent is good.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's perspective. She's not into anything, which could be due to lack of interest, burnout from trying too many things, or feeling pressured. The parents might be missing the fact that she's not interested in any of the suggested activities. Maybe she hasn't found her passion yet, or the activities don't align with her interests. The parents are trying to push her into something without considering that her \"nothing\" might be a sign of needing different options or more autonomy.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies an expectation of success. This could stem from parental aspirations or societal pressures. However, expecting a teenager to excel might not account for her natural talents or interests. The daughter's calling them controlling suggests that the parents' approach is making her feel forced, even if they're not restricting her choices.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, being supportive vs. pressuring is crucial. While encouraging exploration is good, expecting excellence without allowing the child to find her own path can be harmful. The parents might not realize that the daughter's resistance is a defense mechanism against perceived control. The answer hinges on whether the parents' approach is respectful of her autonomy versus imposing their expectations under the guise of support.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parents' intentions are well-meaning but their execution might be flawed. They are in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of excellence without allowing the daughter to explore her own interests without pressure. The answer is A.\n"
