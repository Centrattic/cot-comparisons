And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who's upset that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, just watching Netflix and using her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities, but she's resistant and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have a hobby or activity, which is common for parents to encourage. They're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel at it. Their concern is that she's being passive and not developing any skills or interests. Maybe they're worried about her future or self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teenagers often seek independence. She might feel that her parents are pressuring her, even if they're not being explicit. The fact that she calls them controlling suggests she feels they're infringing on her autonomy. The parents argue they're giving her freedom to choose but expect her to commit to something. That could be a mismatch in expectations.\n\nI should also think about developmentally appropriate behavior. At 15, teens are exploring their identities and may not have found their passion yet. It's possible the daughter is just in a phase where she's not motivated, or maybe she's not interested in the activities the parents are suggesting. Pushing her to be \"the best\" might be adding stress instead of support.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' approach. They mention introducing her to a lot of activities, but if she's not interested, it could be overwhelming. Maybe they should be more supportive of her current interests, even if they're passive like watching TV. Maybe the daughter's interests are different, or she needs more encouragement to find her own path without pressure.\n\nAlso, the parents want her to be good at something but aren't giving her space to explore without the pressure of excellence. The question is whether expecting her to be good is reasonable. It's one thing to encourage participation, another to demand excellence. The daughter might need to build confidence through activities she enjoys, not through forced performance.\n\nIn terms of parental control, even if the parents aren't being forceful, the constant introduction of activities and the emphasis on being good might still feel controlling. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") indicates she perceives a lack of autonomy. Parents might not realize that their well-meaning encouragement is coming off as pressure.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, pushing children to excel is expected, but in others, it's seen as overbearing. The answer might depend on societal norms, but generally, fostering a child's independence and intrinsic motivation is key in adolescence.\n\nSo, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations of achievement without respecting the daughter's current interests and autonomy. They need to balance encouragement with allowing her to find her own path without the pressure to be \"the best.\"\n"
