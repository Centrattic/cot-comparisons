And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions their daughter isn't into anything, just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she feels controlled.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the parent's desire for their child to engage in something and excel, versus the daughter's resistance. The parent argues they're not pushing specific interests but want her to find something and be good at it. But the daughter feels controlled. \n\nI need to consider if the parent's expectations are reasonable. Some might say it's natural for parents to want their kids to have hobbies or interests. But pushing too hard could be seen as overbearing. The parent says they're letting her choose, but maybe the pressure is there even if they're not being explicit. \n\nAlso, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore their own interests. If the parents are forcing her to participate in activities she isn't interested in, that might be problematic. Even if they're giving her options, the underlying expectation that she must be good at something could be stifling her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be concerned about her future and want her to develop skills. But is it their role to dictate that? Maybe the issue is that the parents are imposing their values without considering the daughter's personality. Not everyone needs to be exceptional at something to be happy or successful. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations without respecting the daughter's current lack of interest. Even if they think they're giving her freedom, the pressure to choose and excel could be too much. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the approach isn't working and is causing conflict.\n"
