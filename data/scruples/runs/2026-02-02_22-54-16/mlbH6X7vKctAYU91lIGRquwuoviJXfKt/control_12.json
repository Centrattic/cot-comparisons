And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. The parents are concerned because Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to find a passion or skill, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but are encouraging her to be involved in something. However, Ellie feels pressured and labels them as controlling. \n\nNow, the key points here: The parents are pushing for involvement without specifying the activity, but Ellie isn't interested. At 15, teenagers often go through phases of exploring their interests, and some might not have found their niche yet. The parents' approach of introducing various options might be overwhelming or not resonating with Ellie's current interests.\n\nAnother angle is the pressure to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something. That could create stress and anxiety for Ellie, leading her to resist. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto their daughter, not considering that Ellie might value different things or is still figuring out her path. \n\nEllie's response of calling them controlling suggests that she feels her autonomy is being undermined. Even if the parents are trying to be supportive, their methods might be too directive. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. The parents might not realize that their insistence on being good at something could discourage Ellie from trying new things because she's afraid of not meeting expectations.\n\nAlso, considering developmentally, teenagers need space to explore and make their own choices. If the parents are constantly steering her towards activities she doesn't choose, it could lead to resentment and a lack of intrinsic motivation. Ellie might not be into activities because she hasn't found the right fit yet, and the pressure is making her disengage further.\n\nHowever, the parents' concern isn't entirely unfounded. They want their daughter to have interests and skills that contribute to her well-being and future. The issue is how they're approaching it. The problem might be the parents' insistence on her being \"good\" at something rather than supporting her in finding what she enjoys and developing naturally.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents might be in the wrong if their expectations are causing Ellie to feel controlled and if they're not allowing her the freedom to explore at her own pace without the pressure of being the best. The key is balancing support with respect for her autonomy.\n"
