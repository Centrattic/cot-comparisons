And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent says the daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and only does TV and phone stuff. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities. The daughter feels controlled, but the parents argue they're just encouraging her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have interests and skills, which is a common parental desire. They mention not forcing specific activities but wanting her to commit to something. However, the daughter is feeling pressured and labeled the parents as controlling. At 15, teenagers are developing independence, and being pushed to excel might be counterproductive. It's important to balance guidance with allowing the child to explore without pressure.\n\nThe parents might not realize that their expectations could be overwhelming. Even if they're not dictating the activity, the emphasis on being \"good\" might create anxiety. The daughter's resistance could indicate a need for autonomy or different interests that the parents aren't considering. Pushing could lead to resentment or a lack of intrinsic motivation. The parents should focus on supporting her interests rather than enforcing success in something. So, the answer might be A, the parents are in the wrong, because their approach is pressuring the daughter without respecting her current lack of interest, even if their intentions are good.\n"
