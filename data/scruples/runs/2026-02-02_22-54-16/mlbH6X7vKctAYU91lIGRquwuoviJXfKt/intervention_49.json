And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter, Ellie, is 15 and not really into anything except Netflix and her phone. The parents have tried introducing her to various activities but she's resisting and called them controlling. The parents say they're not pushing a specific activity but want her to commit to something and excel at it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out the key points here. The parents want Ellie to have a hobby or skill where she can be good. They've tried multiple things, but she's not interested. They feel she's being aimless and not contributing at home. The daughter feels controlled, but the parents argue they're giving her freedom to choose the activity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. Let me break this down. Is it wrong to want a child to have some passion or skill? Well, it's natural for parents to want the best for their kids, but pushing too hard can be problematic. The daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore their interests. However, the parents are encouraging her to find something and be good at it, but she's resisting.\n\nThe parents say they let her choose whatever she wants as long as she does something and is good at it. But is that actually giving her choice? If the main condition is that she needs to be good, maybe that's not just about participation. Maybe the pressure is on the outcome, not the activity itself. The daughter might feel that they're not accepting her current interests, or that they're disappointed if she doesn't excel.\n\nAlso, the parents are introducing her to everything they can. That might come across as overwhelming. Maybe they're not giving her the space to explore on her own. The daughter's call of being controlling could indicate that she feels her autonomy is being restricted. The parents might be setting high expectations, which can be stressful for a teenager. \n\nBut the parents are concerned about her being aimless and not contributing at home. They might be worried about her future or her well-being. However, expecting a 15-year-old to already be the best at something might be unrealistic. At that age, it's more about exploration and self-discovery. The focus should be on finding what she enjoys, not necessarily excelling immediately.\n\nOn the flip side, the parents' approach could be seen as supportive. They are offering opportunities, which is good. But the emphasis on being \"good at it\" might be the issue. The daughter might feel that they're only interested in her achievements, not her interests or happiness. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Maybe they're not in the wrong, but their approach could be adjusted. The daughter's resistance suggests that the way they're presenting the expectation might be too forceful. The parents might need to step back, encourage without conditions, and accept that Ellie might not have a passion yet or might find hers later. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's behavior\u2014only engaging in passive activities like watching TV and using her phone\u2014there's a valid concern about her not being active. However, the parents should consider that she might be going through a phase, or perhaps she's introverted, or her interests are different. It's possible she's not into the activities they're offering. Maybe they need to let her choose without the implied requirement to excel.\n\nIn summary, while the parents' intention is to help Ellie find a meaningful activity, their method of expecting her to be the best at it might be where the problem lies. The daughter's perception of control is important here. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the pressure to be \"good\" might be stifling her ability to explore and find her own interests without fear of judgment.\n"
