And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent (the author) who is upset that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's a sport, art, music, etc., but Ellie isn't interested and feels controlled. The parents are introducing her to various activities but she's resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have a hobby or something she's good at, which they see as important. They're not forcing specific activities but are encouraging her to choose something. However, Ellie is calling them controlling. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, parents often want their children to have interests and skills, and it's natural to want the best for them. However, pushing a teenager to do things they aren't interested in can be seen as overbearing. At 15, Ellie is old enough to have her own preferences and may be going through a phase where she's exploring her identity. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's autonomy.\n\nThe parents might be guilty of not respecting Ellie's choice to not engage in activities right now. Maybe Ellie is going through a different phase or has other interests that the parents aren't considering. Also, the parents' approach of introducing her to many activities could be overwhelming. It's possible that their desire for her to be \"good at something\" is their own pressure rather than what's best for Ellie.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are trying to encourage their daughter to be more active and involved, which is a common concern for parents. They might feel that doing nothing is not acceptable and want to steer her towards productivity. However, the key here is whether they are forcing or pressuring her, which could be the issue. The line between encouraging and controlling can be thin.\n\nThe parents might not be in the wrong if their intention is to support Ellie in finding her passion, but if they're pressuring her to meet their expectations, then they might be overstepping. The fact that Ellie is calling them controlling suggests that she feels the pressure, which might indicate that the parents are crossing that line.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because they are not respecting their daughter's autonomy and may be imposing their own expectations. However, if the parents are genuinely trying to guide without forcing, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the daughter is feeling controlled, the parents might be at fault.\n"
