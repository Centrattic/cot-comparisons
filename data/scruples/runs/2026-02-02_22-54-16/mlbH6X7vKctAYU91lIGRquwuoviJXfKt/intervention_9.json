And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends most of her time on her phone or watching TV. They want her to be good at something, even if it's not specific, but she's resisting and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They seem concerned about Ellie's lack of direction and want her to have hobbies or activities that she excels in. They're trying various things, giving her choices, but Ellie isn't interested. The parents believe they're not being controlling, but Ellie feels the opposite. \n\nNow, the key points here: The parents are pushing for Ellie to be involved and good at something, but not specifying what. They give her options, so maybe they're encouraging exploration. However, at 15, some teens are still figuring out their interests. Forcing or pressuring might not be helpful. The parents might not realize that Ellie isn't into any of the activities they're introducing, which could be a mismatch in interests.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a valid concern about their daughter's engagement. It's common for parents to want their kids to have skills or passions. But the line between support and control might be crossed if the pressure is too much. The daughter feeling controlled suggests that the approach might be too heavy-handed, even if the parents think they're offering freedom.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's perspective. At 15, she's in a stage where she's developing her identity. If her parents constantly push her to excel in something she's not interested in, it could lead to resentment or anxiety. The fact that she's not interested in the activities they're suggesting might mean they need to adjust their approach, rather than insist on her being involved.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are using Ellie's current behavior (not participating in anything) as a problem to fix. But maybe the issue is that they have high expectations, and Ellie is struggling to meet them. It's possible that the parents are projecting their own desires onto her, not respecting her autonomy. Even if they're giving her choices, the underlying message might be that she must succeed in something, which can feel like pressure.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a lot of emphasis on children being well-rounded or having achievements. However, individual differences matter. Some teenagers are more introspective and may not find their passion until later. The parents might need to be more patient or find a middle ground where Ellie can explore at her own pace without feeling forced.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parents might not be entirely in the wrong because they're concerned about their daughter's future and well-being. However, their approach could be contributing to the problem by making Ellie feel controlled. The answer hinges on whether their expectations are reasonable and how they're enforcing them. If they're pressuring her without understanding her interests, that could be the issue. But if they're genuinely trying to help her find her path, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a nuanced situation.\n"
