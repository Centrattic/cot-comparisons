And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who's upset that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, just watches TV and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's reasoning is that they want their daughter to have interests and skills, not just be aimless. They say they're not forcing her to do any specific thing but want her to choose something and excel at it. However, the daughter feels pressured, even if the parents don't see themselves as controlling.\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, wanting their child to be engaged and develop some talents or skills is common. Parents often want their kids to build confidence and have hobbies. But the daughter's reaction suggests she feels the pressure is too much. The key question is whether the parents are being overbearing without respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAt 15, teenagers are figuring out their identities. If the parents are pushing for her to excel in something, maybe they're not considering her interests or that she's not ready to commit. The fact that she's called them controlling might indicate that the approach is causing stress rather than encouraging her. Even if the parents are offering choices, the expectation that she must be good at something could be a problem. It's possible that the daughter might not be interested in any of the suggested activities, or maybe she's not passionate about them, leading to resistance.\n\nAlso, the parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable. While it's valid to encourage a healthy balance, the approach might be too rigid. The daughter's current activities (TV and phone) are what many teens do, but the parents are concerned about her lack of direction. However, it's possible that the daughter is just going through a phase or has different priorities.\n\nAnother angle is the pressure to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something. That might not be realistic for everyone, and the daughter might not be inclined towards competition. The parents' emphasis on excellence could be causing her to disengage because she feels evaluated rather than supported. It's important to foster intrinsic motivation rather than external validation.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative parents set expectations but are responsive to their child's needs. If the parents are being more authoritarian, imposing structure without flexibility, that could be the issue. The daughter's feeling that she's being controlled suggests that the balance isn't right.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is causing the daughter to feel pressured and not respecting her autonomy. Even if their intentions are good, the method of pressuring her to excel in something she's not interested in might not be effective. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to weigh the parents' concern against the daughter's well-being and autonomy.\n"
