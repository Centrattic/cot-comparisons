And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, even if it's not specific, but Ellie is resistant and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement and want her to find something she excels in. Their approach is to introduce various activities, allowing her to choose, but with the underlying expectation that she must be good at something. The daughter feels pressured, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, encouraging children to explore different interests is common. However, the line between support and pressure is thin here. The parents might be projecting their own values onto Ellie, expecting her to find her passion, but maybe not respecting her current lack of interest. Teenagers often go through phases of disinterest or experimentation, and pushing too hard could lead to resistance.\n\nThe daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests she feels her autonomy is being undermined. Even if the parents aren't dictating specific activities, the underlying message of needing to be good at something might be too much. It's possible the parents are not considering that Ellie might not need to be \"the best\" to be happy or successful. Societal pressures to achieve can sometimes lead parents to impose their expectations on children.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are trying to guide their child towards a more structured path, which can be beneficial. However, if the approach is leading to conflict and resentment, it might not be the right method. The key is whether the parents are truly allowing Ellie to choose or if the expectation of being \"good\" is still a form of pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents might be in the wrong if their expectations are causing stress and not considering Ellie's autonomy. The right approach would involve open dialogue, supporting her interests without pressure, and understanding that not everyone excels in traditional ways.\n"
