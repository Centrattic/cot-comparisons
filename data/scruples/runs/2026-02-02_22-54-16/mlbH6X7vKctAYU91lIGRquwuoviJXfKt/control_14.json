And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who posted this situation is in the wrong. The parent, Ellie's parent, is concerned that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything. They want her to be good at something, even if it's any activity, and they've tried introducing her to various options like sports, art, instruments, etc. But Ellie isn't interested and feels controlled. The parent argues they're not forcing specific activities but want her to find something she's into and excel at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might genuinely be worried about Ellie's future, wanting her to have skills or hobbies that could help her in life or build confidence. Parents often have these expectations based on their own values or fears for their child's success. But then there's Ellie's perspective. At 15, she's in high school, a time of self-discovery. Feeling pressured by parents to excel at something might lead to resistance or a lack of genuine interest. If the parents are pushing too hard, it could backfire, making her disengage more. \n\nThe key here is the framing. The parent says they're not forcing specific things but insist she must be good at something. That might come off as pressure even if it's not direct force. The parent's approach could be seen as imposing a need for achievement without considering Ellie's autonomy. Adolescents often rebel against perceived control, so Ellie calling them controlling might be valid if they're not allowing her to explore without pressure. \n\nAlso, the parent's statement that \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" might be too rigid. Every teenager isn't expected to have hobbies that align with their parents' standards. Maybe Ellie is into something different that the parents aren't aware of, or perhaps she's going through a phase. It's important to respect her choices while guiding her. The parent's insistence on being good at something might not account for Ellie's personality or interests. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern isn't entirely without merit. Encouraging a child to find activities that engage them can be beneficial. But the method here seems to be pushing for excellence in any area, which might not be the right approach. The problem might be the parent's definition of \"good\" and the pressure to excel, rather than supporting Ellie in finding what she genuinely enjoys without the stress of being the best. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, this might lean towards authoritative, where there's a balance between demands and responsiveness. However, if the parent is setting high expectations without considering the child's input, it could cross into authoritarian territory. The key issue here is the pressure to be good at something versus allowing the child to explore without the need for excellence. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent might be in the wrong because their approach could be too controlling under the guise of support. They might not be respecting Ellie's autonomy and interests, leading her to push back. The right approach would involve more open dialogue and less pressure to excel in any specific area.\n"
