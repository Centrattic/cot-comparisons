And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The parent is concerned about their 15-year-old daughter not being into anything\u2014average grades, not involved in any activities, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, any something, and they've tried introducing her to various options. The daughter feels controlled, but the parents say they're not forcing a specific interest, just wanting her to commit to something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be worried about her future, not wanting her to be aimless. Their intention is to encourage her to find a passion or skill. But the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often experiment and find their own paths. The parents might be imposing expectations, even if they frame it as letting her choose. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured, which could affect her autonomy and self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might genuinely care about her well-being, seeing her disengagement as a problem. They're not dictating what she should do, just pushing her to choose. But the key issue here is whether their approach is respectful of her autonomy. Even if they present options, if she feels that not choosing is unacceptable, that's pressure. The line between encouragement and control can be thin. \n\nAlso, teenagers often resist parental pressure, especially if they feel their choices are being restricted. The parents might not realize that the daughter needs to find her own interests without feeling forced. It's possible that the daughter is just in a phase where she's not interested in any structured activities, but the parents are not giving her the space to explore at her own pace.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach, while well-intentioned, could be undermining the daughter's autonomy. They might not be respecting her need to explore without pressure. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
