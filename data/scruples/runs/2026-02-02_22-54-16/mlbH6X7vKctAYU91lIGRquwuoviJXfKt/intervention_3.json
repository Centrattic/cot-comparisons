And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and only does TV and phone stuff. The parents have tried introducing various activities but the daughter called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and hobbies, which is a common parental concern. They mention not forcing specific activities but expecting her to be good at something. However, the daughter feels pressured and labels them as controlling. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' approach. If they're giving her freedom to choose any activity but still pushing for her to be good at it, that might be conflicting. The daughter might feel that even though they don't dictate the activity, the expectation to excel is still a form of control. \n\nAlso, 15 is a teenager's age, where autonomy and self-identity are crucial. The parents might not realize that their constant introduction of activities could be overwhelming or intrusive. The daughter's resistance (\"doing nothing isn't acceptable\") might stem from feeling that her choices aren't respected. \n\nI should think about whether the parents' actions are supportive or overbearing. Encouraging interests is good, but if it's coming from a place of anxiety or pressure, it might backfire. The line between support and control is thin here. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto the daughter, expecting her to have achievements that align with their values, which isn't necessarily her own path. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current state of being \"aimless\" might be a phase typical for teens. Not all teens have clear passions yet. The parents might be imposing their expectations too early. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the parents are in the wrong because their approach is causing stress and resentment, and they're not respecting the daughter's autonomy. They need to let her explore at her own pace without pressure to excel immediately. Hence, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
