And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent's main concern is that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't involved in anything and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to be good at something, anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want Ellie to have a hobby or activity where she can excel, which they see as positive. But Ellie is resisting and feeling controlled. The key here is the parent's approach. They mention giving her freedom to choose but expecting her to be good at it. That might be conflicting. Letting her choose but still pressuring her to be good could be seen as contradictory. \n\nAlso, at 15, teenagers often seek independence. The parent's push might be infringing on that, especially if Ellie feels pressured to perform. The parent's statement about \"doing nothing not being acceptable\" might come across as judgmental. Even if they mean it for her own good, the way it's framed could be causing tension. \n\nAnother angle is that the parent is trying to help their child develop a skill or interest, which is a common parental desire. But the method\u2014introducing a lot of activities and expecting her to be good\u2014might not respect Ellie's autonomy. The daughter might need space to explore without pressure. \n\nI should also think about the daughter's perspective. Feeling called controlling suggests that the parent's actions are perceived as overbearing. Even if they're not being direct, the pressure to be good at something might be too much. The parent's emphasis on being \"the best\" or \"good\" could be adding stress rather than encouraging her naturally.\n\nBut then again, parents often want the best for their children. Maybe the parent's intentions are good, but the execution is flawed. The question is whether the parent is wrong. If the parent is respecting her choices but still pushing for involvement, maybe it's a gray area. However, if the parent's expectations are too high or the methods are causing the daughter to feel controlled, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concern is understandable, their approach might be too controlling, leading the daughter to feel pressured. The answer would likely be that the parent is in the wrong (A), but I need to make sure. The daughter's resistance and the parents' reaction to that (defending their approach by saying they're not controlling) might indicate they are not considering her feelings enough.\n"
