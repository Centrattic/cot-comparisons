And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe daughter is 15, not into anything, average grades, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, music, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents insist they're not forcing specific choices but want her to commit to something and be good at it. They see doing nothing as unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They might feel concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement, both academically and extracurricularly. Their goal is probably to encourage her to develop skills, interests, or passions that could benefit her future. They might believe that having a hobby or talent can build confidence, discipline, and a sense of achievement. However, they might not realize how their approach is coming across as pushy or controlling.\n\nOn the daughter's side, being 15 is a time when adolescents are developing their own identities. She might feel pressured by her parents' expectations, leading her to resist and label them as controlling. She might not know what she's interested in yet, or maybe the activities they've introduced just don't resonate with her. Her withdrawal into TV and phone could be her way of dealing with the pressure or just a personal preference they're not respecting.\n\nThe parents say they're allowing her to choose, but the underlying message is that she must choose *something* and be good at it. This could inadvertently create stress and reduce her autonomy. The key question is whether the parents' desire for her to excel in an area is infringing on her right to self-determination. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, adolescents need to explore their interests without external pressure. The parents' insistence on her being \"the best\" or at least \"good\" might be counterproductive, as it could lead to burnout, anxiety, or resentment. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests that she feels her autonomy is being violated, which could harm the parent-child relationship.\n\nHowever, it's also valid for parents to want their children to have interests and skills. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. The parents might not be outright forcing her into specific activities, but their insistence on her choosing *any* activity and succeeding at it might still be too much. The problem could be that they're not considering that she might not have found her passion yet or that their definition of \"good\" isn't aligned with her interests.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the answer would depend on whether the parents overstepped. If they're creating a hostile environment where the daughter feels forced, then they might be in the wrong. But if they're genuinely trying to guide her without being overbearing, maybe not. However, the daughter's reaction and the parents' approach suggest that their methods are problematic. They might be projecting their own desires onto her or not respecting her individuality.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, I think the parents are in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations without fully respecting the daughter's autonomy and current interests. Their desire for her to excel in something is understandable, but the way they're approaching it is causing conflict and potentially stifling her self-discovery.\n"
