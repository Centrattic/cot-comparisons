And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and the parents want her to be good at something, even if they're not pushing a specific activity. They've tried introducing various options but she's resistant, calling them controlling. The parent feels they're not being controlling but rather encouraging her to find something.\n\nHmm. On one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests or talents, which can be beneficial. But on the other hand, the daughter is 15 and might be going through a phase where she's figuring out her own interests. Forcing her to find something she's good at might be counterproductive. The parents are letting her choose, but they still have an expectation that she should be good at something. That pressure could be coming across as controlling, even if their intention is to encourage.\n\nThe daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured. Maybe the parents aren't being overbearing, but their approach might not be considering her current stage in life. Adolescence is a time of exploration and identity formation. If the daughter isn't interested in any of the activities they've tried, maybe she's not ready yet or has different interests that they haven't considered. The parents might benefit from giving her more space and trusting her to find her own path without the pressure of being \"the best\" or \"good at something.\" \n\nAlso, expecting someone to be good at something can sometimes lead to stress and burnout. It's important for the daughter to explore without the pressure of performance. The parents might think they're supporting her by pushing her to engage, but it's possible they're not respecting her autonomy. The key issue here is the parents' expectation that she must excel in something, even if it's not her choice. That could be where they're wrong. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their approach might be too controlling despite their intentions.\n"
