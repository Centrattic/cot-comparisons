And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent is concerned that their 15-year-old daughter isn't involved in any activities and is spending time on TV and her phone. They've introduced her to various options but she's resistant and labels them as controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to be engaged and excel in some area, which is common for parents who hope their children find passions or skills. However, the daughter is 15, an age where teenagers often start developing their own interests and may push back against parental influence. The parent mentions they're not forcing specific activities but are encouraging her to choose something. The daughter perceives this as controlling, which is a key point.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Parents often want their children to have achievements and hobbies, but every child is different. Some teens may not feel driven to pursue extracurriculars intensely. The parent's approach of introducing various options is reasonable, but the pressure to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" might be problematic. The daughter's resistance could stem from feeling pressured rather than genuinely interested.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that doing nothing isn't acceptable. However, it's important to respect the child's autonomy. While it's okay for parents to encourage exploration, enforcing that she must excel in something they choose could be overstepping. The daughter's reaction as \"controlling\" suggests that the parent's expectations might be too high or not aligned with her interests.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she might be in a phase of trying to find her own identity. Pushing too hard could lead to resentment or a lack of intrinsic motivation. The parent's goal is valid, but the method might be the issue. They should focus on supporting her in finding her own interests rather than expecting excellence in any chosen area.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions are good, their expectations might not consider the daughter's autonomy and natural interests. The pressure to be good at something specific could be the source of the conflict. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong by imposing their expectations without respecting the daughter's need to explore her own path.\n"
