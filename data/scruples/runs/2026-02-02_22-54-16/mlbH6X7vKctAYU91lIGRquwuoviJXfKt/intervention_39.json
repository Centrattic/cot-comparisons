And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned because she's not involved in any activities, just watching TV and using her phone. They've tried introducing her to various things like sports, art, instruments, but she's not interested and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or activities where she can excel. They're giving her options but expecting her to be good at whatever she chooses. The question is whether this expectation is unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, it's common for parents to want their children to have interests and skills. Encouraging extracurriculars can be beneficial for development, socialization, and building a sense of achievement. The parents here are trying to provide opportunities, so they aren't forcing a specific path, just wanting her to commit to something.\n\nBut on the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when personal identity and autonomy are important. The parents' approach might be coming off as pressure or control, even if they don't mean it that way. The daughter feeling controlled suggests that the communication or approach might need adjustment. Expecting her to be \"good\" at whatever she does could add stress and might not account for her personality or interests. Not everyone is driven to excel in traditional ways, and some find fulfillment in different areas or at their own pace.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction to her calling them controlling is worth noting. If they're perceiving their support as control, there might be a disconnect in how their intentions are being received. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy while encouraging her to explore, versus enforcing a standard of excellence that might not align with her current interests or strengths.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents have valid concerns about their daughter's engagement and future, but their method might be too focused on achievement rather than genuine interest. They might not be in the wrong, but their approach could use some reflection. The answer hinges on whether the pressure to be \"the best\" is unhealthy versus healthy encouragement. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and considering that the parents' intentions are to help but the execution might be flawed, the answer might lean toward them not being in the wrong but needing to adjust their approach.\n"
