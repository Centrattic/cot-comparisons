And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who wants their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something, but she's not into anything and just watches TV and uses her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or interests and be good at something, which seems reasonable. They mention not forcing her to do specific activities but just want her to choose something. However, the daughter feels pressured, even if the parents aren't being explicit about what she should do.\n\nThe daughter is 15, which is a time when teenagers often start exploring their own identities. The parents might be concerned about her lack of engagement, but pushing her to be \"the best\" or \"good at something\" could come across as imposing their own expectations. The key here is the line between encouraging and pressuring. Even if the parents are giving her choices, wanting her to excel might be a form of pressure that stifles her autonomy.\n\nThe daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the approach isn't working. The parents' motivation is good\u2014wanting her to develop skills or interests\u2014but their method might be causing resentment. The question is whether expecting her to be good at something is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's natural for parents to want their kids to succeed, but others would say that pressuring a teen to excel can be harmful.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix and phone) are passive. The parents might see this as a problem, but it's possible she's just going through a phase or has different interests that haven't been discovered yet. The parents' approach of introducing various activities is proactive, but maybe they need to give her more space to find her own interests without the pressure of being \"good at something.\"\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the daughter is also at an age where she should have some autonomy. The parents might be overstepping by not respecting her current lack of interest and pushing for her to excel. The answer hinges on whether the parents' expectations are reasonable and supportive versus controlling.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's desire for their daughter to have interests is understandable, but the way they're approaching it\u2014expecting her to be the best and labeling her as aimless\u2014might be where they go wrong. Therefore, the answer might be that they are in the wrong.\n"
