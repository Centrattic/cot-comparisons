And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's fair to expect their 15-year-old daughter to be the best at something. The parents are concerned because she's not into anything, her grades are average, and she doesn't do much at home besides watch Netflix and use her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's pushing back, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They mention they want her to be good at something, regardless of what it is, so she can have a hobby or interest. The key part is that they're not forcing specific activities from their own past, but they do want her to commit to something she chooses and excel at it. However, the daughter isn't interested in any of the options they've presented. \n\nNow, the daughter is 15, which is a typical age when teenagers start to assert their independence. If the parents are pressuring her to choose and excel at an activity without considering her interests or boundaries, that could be problematic. The daughter's response of feeling controlled suggests that the parents might be coming off as overbearing, even if their intention is good.\n\nThe parents might be conflating allowing her to choose with expecting her to perform well. Just because they let her pick any activity doesn't mean she's naturally inclined or interested in them. Expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" could create undue stress and resentment. It's important for a teenager to explore different things without the pressure of having to excel. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her lack of direction. It's common for parents to want their children to have hobbies or passions, especially if they worry about future opportunities or well-being. But the way they're approaching it might be the issue. Instead of pushing for her to be good, maybe encouraging her to explore and find something she genuinely enjoys without judgment would be better. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (TV and phone) are passive. The parents might want her to engage in more active or constructive pastimes. However, if they're making her feel that her current interests are invalid, that's where the line is crossed. The daughter's right to choose her own activities is important, even if they're not the ones the parents prefer. \n\nThe term \"controlling\" is significant here. If the parents are setting conditions where she must participate in something to meet their expectations, it could be seen as controlling. Healthy parenting allows for autonomy. So, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is pressuring her to conform to their standards rather than supporting her self-discovery.\n"
