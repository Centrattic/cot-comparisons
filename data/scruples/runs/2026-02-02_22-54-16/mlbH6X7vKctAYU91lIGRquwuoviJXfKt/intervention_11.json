And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent is concerned because their daughter isn't into anything and is just watching TV and using her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resisting and called them controlling.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to be good at something, which could be for her future success or personal growth. But is pushing for that acceptable? The parent says they aren't forcing her to choose a specific activity, just that she should be into something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled. There's a conflict here between the parents' expectations and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAdolescence is a time when teens often test boundaries and seek independence. The daughter might be feeling pressured even if the parents aren't being overtly forceful. The parents might not realize that their expectations, even if well-meaning, could be causing stress. The key issue is whether the parents are respecting their daughter's interests and autonomy versus imposing their own desires onto her.\n\nAlso, the parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable. But every teenager is different. Some might need more encouragement to find their interests. The fact that the daughter isn't into the activities they've introduced could mean that those aren't her passions. Maybe the parents need to adjust their approach, like allowing more time for her to explore or considering her input more actively.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about their daughter's lack of direction. It's natural for parents to want the best for their children. However, pushing too hard can lead to resentment. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that their approach might be too rigid. The problem might be that the parents are setting a condition that she must be good at something without considering her own pace or interests.\n\nI think the parents are in a tough spot. Their intentions are good, but the method might be flawed. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's room for improvement in how they handle the situation. The answer might depend on balancing parental guidance with the child's autonomy. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the parents need to adjust their approach to support her without overstepping.\n"
