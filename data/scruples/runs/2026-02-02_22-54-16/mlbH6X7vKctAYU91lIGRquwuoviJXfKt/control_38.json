And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent says their daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant, even calling them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel at it.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or activities, which is common. But maybe the pressure is too much? The daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore their interests. If the parents are pushing her to find something and be the best, that might be stressful. However, they claim they're giving her freedom in choosing what. But maybe the underlying message is that she has to do something, which could feel like pressure. \n\nAlso, the daughter is calling them controlling, even if they say they aren't being specific. It's possible that the parents' insistence on her being good at something, combined with trying various activities, is overwhelming. At 15, kids might not have found their passion yet. Is it wrong to expect a teenager to be good at something? Well, it's natural for parents to want their kids to have interests, but expecting excellence might be unrealistic if the kid isn't interested. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter's current activities are passive (TV, phone), which the parents don't like. They want her to have more active pursuits. But forcing her into activities she doesn't choose might backfire. The parents might be right in wanting her to have hobbies, but their approach could be too pushy. Maybe the daughter needs space to explore her own interests without pressure. \n\nSo the key points are the pressure to be \"good\" at something vs. allowing her to find her own path. The parents might not be forcing specific activities, but they are imposing the expectation of excelling in any activity. That could be seen as inconsiderate of the daughter's autonomy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations without considering their daughter's preferences and interests, leading to stress and resistance.\n"
