And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The parent is concerned because their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's resisting and called them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific interests but want her to choose something and excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or passions, which is a common parental desire. But the way they're approaching it might be the issue. The daughter feels pressured, even if the parents think they're not being controlling. The key here is the line between encouragement and pressure. Expecting excellence might be too much, especially if the daughter isn't naturally interested. Adolescents often explore different interests, and forcing them could lead to resentment. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto their child. Also, the daughter's well-being is important; pushing her to be the best could create stress. The answer might hinge on whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus pushing for their own expectations. So, while the parents have good intentions, the approach might be where they're wrong. Answer A or B? The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I might lean towards A because the pressure could be harmful even if unintended.\n"
