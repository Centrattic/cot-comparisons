And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want Ellie to have hobbies or activities where she can excel. Their goal is to encourage her to find a passion or strength. But the parent's approach might be seen as pressuring her to perform, even if they say they're letting her choose what to do. The key point is that they want her to be \"the best at something,\" which might create stress. \n\nFrom Ellie's point of view, she's 15\u2014still figuring things out. Not everyone has a passion at that age. The parent's insistence could come across as controlling, even if they're trying to be supportive. The daughter feels pressured because the parent keeps introducing new activities, which might not leave her space to explore her own interests without judgment. \n\nNow, societal expectations vary. Some might say parents should push kids to find their strengths, while others argue that teens should have autonomy. The parent's reasoning is that doing nothing isn't acceptable, but Ellie might need time to discover her interests without external pressure.\n\nI think the parent's intentions are good, but their method might be problematic. By emphasizing that she needs to be good at something, they might be setting up a scenario where Ellie feels like a failure if she doesn't succeed in the first few attempts. Also, labeling her as \"aimless\" could affect her self-esteem. The parent might not realize that some people develop interests later, or that not excelling in structured activities doesn't define one's value.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concern is valid, their approach could be perceived as overbearing. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the expectations might be too high and the pressure could be harmful, even if the intentions are good.\n"
