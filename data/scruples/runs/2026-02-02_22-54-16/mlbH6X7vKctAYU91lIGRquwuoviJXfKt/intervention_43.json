And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The situation is that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, regardless of what it is, and they've tried introducing various activities, but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have hobbies or interests outside of school, which is common for parents who want their kids to develop skills and have a well-rounded life. They mention they're not forcing her to do specific things but expect her to choose something and be good at it. Their concern is that she's aimless and not involved. They do say they're not controlling, just encouraging her to engage in activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teenagers often seek independence. The pressure from parents might feel like control, especially if the daughter feels her choices are being restricted. The parents' insistence on her being \"good at something\" could be contributing to the daughter's resistance. There's a balance between parental guidance and respecting a teenager's autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy. The parents are trying to push for engagement, but the daughter isn't interested, leading to conflict. The parents might be overstepping if they're not allowing her to find her own path without pressure. However, their intention is to encourage development, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's a bit gray. They might be imposing their expectations without fully respecting the daughter's interests and pace. Teenagers often go through phases where they're figuring out their interests, and forcing them into something might not be effective. The parents' approach could be seen as well-meaning but perhaps not supportive of her individuality.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong, but maybe B is possible if the parents are genuinely trying to encourage without force. But since the daughter is calling them controlling and they're expecting her to be \"good at something\" which adds pressure, the balance might be tipped towards them being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
