And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe daughter is 15, and the parents are worried she's not into anything. Grades are average, she doesn't do much at home except watch TV and use her phone. They want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, clubs, art, etc. They've introduced her to various activities but she's not interested and called them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing her to do anything specific, just that she needs to choose something and be good at it. They don't like her current state of being \"aimless.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider what's normal for a teenager. At 15, many teens are still exploring their interests. Some might not have found something they're passionate about yet. The parents might be pushing because they want her to have hobbies or skills, which is understandable. But is expecting her to be the best or good at something reasonable?\n\nThe parents mention they're not telling her what to do, just that she has to choose and commit. But the daughter feels pressured, which is why she called them controlling. There's a difference between encouraging and pushing too hard. The parents might be coming from a place of wanting the best for her, but maybe they're not respecting her autonomy enough.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (TV, phone) are seen as negative by the parents. But these are common among teenagers, and maybe the parents are overly focused on her not being involved in \"productive\" activities. The parents might be projecting their own values onto their daughter, expecting her to excel in something they value, even if it's not what she's interested in.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter might not have found her passion yet. Forcing her to be good at something could create resentment or anxiety. It's possible that the parents are imposing their standards without considering that their daughter might discover her interests later or in a different way. The phrase \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" could be the issue here. Every teenager is different, and some take longer to find their path.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about their daughter's lack of direction, which could lead to problems later. They might think that having a hobby or skill is important for her development. But the way they're approaching it\u2014introducing her to everything and expecting her to commit to something\u2014might be overwhelming for her. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests that the approach isn't working for her.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, parents place a lot of emphasis on children excelling in certain areas. However, the daughter's perspective is important too. If she's resistant and feels forced, the parents might be overstepping, even if their intentions are good.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parents want their daughter to be good at something, they're introducing her to various activities, but she's not interested and feels controlled. The parents claim they're not forcing her to choose specific activities, but the underlying message is that she must be good at something. The daughter's lack of engagement might be due to not finding her passion yet or feeling pressured.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents have valid concerns about their daughter's future, but their approach might be causing stress for her. They might not be respecting her need to explore at her own pace. The daughter's reaction is a sign that the approach isn't working. The parents could be in the wrong if they're expecting her to conform to their standards without considering her individuality and readiness.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations without respecting the daughter's autonomy and current stage in life.\n"
