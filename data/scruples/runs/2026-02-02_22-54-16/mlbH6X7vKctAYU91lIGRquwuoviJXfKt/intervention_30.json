And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for wanting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The main points are that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on Netflix and her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she's resisting and calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal for a teenager. At 15, it's common for kids to explore their interests and sometimes they might not find something yet. The parents are pushing her to be good at something, but they're not forcing specific activities. They're letting her choose but emphasizing the need to commit to one. \n\nThe concern here is about pressure vs. encouragement. The parents might be trying to guide Ellie towards self-improvement or developing skills, but they could be coming across as controlling. The key is whether they're imposing their own expectations or giving her autonomy. The user says they aren't telling her what to do, just that she must be good at something. But expecting her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" might be setting high standards without considering her individuality or natural inclinations.\n\nEllie's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured. Even if the parents aren't forcing a specific activity, the underlying message that she must be good at something could be stressful. It's possible they're projecting their own desires onto her, which is a common issue. Teenagers often push back against perceived parental pressure.\n\nAlso, the parents might be conflating their child's well-being with their own values. Being good at something can be beneficial, but it's important to respect the child's choices and pace. Maybe Ellie is going through a phase where she's not motivated yet, and the parents' insistence is hindering her ability to find her own interests.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her lack of engagement and want her to have productive outlets. Their intention is likely good, but the approach could be too rigid. The line between support and control is thin. If the parents are open to her interests and not just pushing her to meet their standards, they might be in a better position. But if they're imposing expectations without understanding her, that's where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the parents might not be entirely wrong in wanting the best for their child, but their method of expecting her to be good at something without allowing her to explore and find her own path could be problematic. It's about balance and respecting her autonomy while encouraging her to find her own passions. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they're pressuring her to meet their expectations rather than supporting her natural development.\n"
