And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to find something she's good at. The parents have tried introducing various activities but the daughter feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their child to have interests and skills, which is a common concern for many parents. They're not forcing specific activities but are encouraging her to find something she's into. Their goal is to help her develop a sense of purpose or direction, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is in her teenage years, a time when identity and autonomy are crucial. Feeling pressured by parents can lead to resistance and conflict. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels her autonomy is being invaded. Even if the parents aren't dictating specific choices, the expectation to excel in something might still be a form of pressure.\n\nI need to balance the parents' intentions (supportive but concerned) with the daughter's need for independence. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or if they're genuinely trying to encourage growth. The parents mention they let her choose, which is positive. However, the insistence on her being \"good at something\" might be the issue. Every teenager is different; some find their passions later, and it's not always necessary to be good at something in adolescence.\n\nAlso, the parents' frustration with her current lack of direction is valid, but their approach might not be the right one. Pushing her too hard could backfire, leading to resentment or disengagement. The daughter might need support in finding her interests rather than pressure to excel.\n\nIn summary, while the parents' intentions are good, the way they're approaching it could be problematic. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but their method could use adjustment. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with considerations about their approach.\n"
