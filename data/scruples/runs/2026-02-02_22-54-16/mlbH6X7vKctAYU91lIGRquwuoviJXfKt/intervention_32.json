And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have a hobby or skill, not be aimless. But the daughter feels pressured and called her parents controlling. The key here is the approach. The parents are letting her choose but emphasizing that she must do something and be good at it. The daughter might feel forced even if they're not dictating the activity. \n\nNow, from a child's viewpoint at 15, they're in a stage where autonomy is important. If the parents are pressuring her to choose something and be good at it, even if it's her choice, the underlying message might be that being good is the priority, which can be stressful. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels the pressure, even if the parents don't intend to control her. \n\nAlso, expecting a teenager to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" could be setting high expectations without considering her interests or burnout. It's possible the daughter isn't interested because she hasn't found her passion yet, and the pressure might be making her resistant. \n\nThe parents are trying to steer her away from what they see as a lack of direction, but their method might not be supportive. The daughter's calling them controlling indicates that their approach might be too pushy, even if they allow her to choose the activity. The focus on being good at something might be more about the parents' desires rather than the child's. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong entirely because they have good intentions, but their approach might be flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The daughter's feelings of being controlled suggest that the parents are overstepping. So maybe they are in the wrong because they're pressuring her to meet their expectations, even if it's framed as a choice. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the pressure is causing resentment and not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n"
