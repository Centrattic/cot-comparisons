And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter Ellie to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something, even if it's not specific. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have direction, which is a common concern. But the key issue here is how they're approaching it. The parents mention they're letting her choose, but the underlying message seems to be that she must be good at something. The daughter feels pressured, which is a red flag. \n\nPushing someone to be \"the best\" can be harmful. It's one thing to encourage exploration and finding a passion, but setting a high bar of being the best might create stress and resistance. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the approach isn't working. The parents might be projecting their own values onto their child without considering Ellie's interests and personality. \n\nAlso, average grades and lack of extracurriculars don't necessarily mean something's wrong. Every child has their own path. The parents might be imposing their own expectations, which isn't fair. The daughter might not have found her passion yet, or maybe she's introverted and doesn't enjoy typical extracurriculars. \n\nThe parents' insistence on her being \"good at something\" could stem from a place of wanting her to succeed, but the method is authoritarian. They're not respecting her autonomy by allowing her to choose without the pressure of excelling. The answer here would hinge on whether the parents' approach is respectful of the child's individuality versus imposing their own desires. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pressuring the daughter to achieve in a way that feels controlling, not supporting her self-discovery.\n"
