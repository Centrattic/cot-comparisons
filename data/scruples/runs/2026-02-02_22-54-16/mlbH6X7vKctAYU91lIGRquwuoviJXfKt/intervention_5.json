And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15, not involved in any activities, and the parents want her to excel at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the parents want their child to have interests or skills, which seems reasonable. Many parents encourage their kids to explore activities for personal growth. But the issue here is that the parents are \"expecting her to be the best,\" which might be problematic. Expecting excellence could be pressuring the child, even if they say they're not being controlling. The daughter feels controlled despite their approach. \n\nThe key points: the parents are pushing for involvement without specifying the activity but still wanting her to excel. The daughter is resisting, feeling forced. The parents might be imposing their expectations under the guise of letting her choose. It's possible they're not being as open as they think. The daughter's autonomy is important. At 15, she's in a stage where finding her own path is crucial. The parents\u2019 expectations might be stifling her self-discovery. \n\nSo, while wanting the child to have interests is good, the pressure to be \"the best\" and the sense of control might be where they're wrong. The daughter's resistance is a sign that their approach isn't working. The parents need to balance support with allowing her the freedom to explore without pressure. Therefore, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A).\n"
