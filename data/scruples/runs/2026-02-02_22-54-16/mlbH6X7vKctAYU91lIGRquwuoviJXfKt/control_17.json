And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watching Netflix and using her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she's called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intent. They mention they aren't pushing her into specific things they like; they're letting her choose. Their goal is for her to find something she's good at, which might be about wanting her to have direction or hobbies. That's a common concern for parents, wanting their kids to develop skills or interests that can help them in life. But is expecting her to be the best at something reasonable?\n\nAt 15, teenagers often explore different interests and may not have found their passion yet. The parents are trying to encourage her, but the daughter feels pressured. Even if the parents aren't forcing a specific activity, the underlying message might be that she needs to do something, which could come across as controlling. The daughter's resistance is valid if she feels her autonomy is being threatened.\n\nAlso, \"being good at something\" might not be the right measure. It's important for kids to find joy and engagement, even if they aren't exceptional. The parents might be conflating effort and interest with the outcome of being the best. Maybe Ellie is into something they haven't considered yet, or she's dealing with other issues like lack of motivation or social anxiety.\n\nAnother angle: the parents' approval of activities. They want her to do something, but if she's not finding it, maybe the pressure is counterproductive. It's possible that their approach is too broad, overwhelming her with options. Or she might not enjoy any of the introduced activities, so she's not engaging. The parents might need to find a balance between support and respecting her current preferences without forcing her into a mold.\n\nIn terms of whether the parents are in the wrong, it's about the method and the message. If they're not dictating the activity but are pushing for some form of achievement, that could still be seen as setting high expectations without considering her own interests or developmental stage. Teenagers need freedom to explore and sometimes fail, which helps them discover their true passions. The daughter calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if they think they're being open. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because the parents' approach, while well-meaning, might be infringing on the daughter's autonomy and not allowing her the space to find her own interests. The key is that expecting her to be good at something without respecting her own choices and passions could be problematic. It's about balancing encouragement with respect for her individuality.\n"
