And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, not getting involved in school activities, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents want her to be good at something, but they're not forcing specific interests; they're allowing her to choose as long as she does something.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider the child's age. At 15, teenagers are often figuring out their interests and identities. The parent's frustration is understandable, as they want their child to have direction and hobbies. However, pushing for excellence in any area might be causing stress. The key here is the balance between support and pressure. The parents are giving options but the daughter feels controlled. This could be because the parents' expectations might be too high or the approach is making her feel like she has to perform rather than explore.\n\nAlso, the daughter's resistance and labeling them as controlling suggest that the method of introducing activities might not be resonating with her. Maybe the approach is too directive, making her feel like she's not in charge of her choices. It's possible the parents are overstepping by not allowing her autonomy in choosing what she's interested in, even if it's not what they expect. The parent's desire for their child to be good at something is common, but the execution might be the issue here. Encouragement without pressure is crucial for adolescents to develop intrinsic motivation. The parents might need to step back and let Ellie explore her interests at her own pace without the implicit expectation of excellence.\n"
