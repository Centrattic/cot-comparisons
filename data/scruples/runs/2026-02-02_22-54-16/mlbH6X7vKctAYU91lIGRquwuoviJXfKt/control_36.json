And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parental perspective. Parents often want their children to have hobbies or interests, thinking it's beneficial for their development. They might believe that having a skill or passion gives a sense of purpose and can lead to future opportunities. But the parent is pushing for Ellie to be \"the best\" or at least good at something. That pressure could be problematic. \n\nEllie is 15, which is adolescence, a time when teens often seek independence. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, Ellie feels controlled, which suggests there's a mismatch in perception. The parents might think they're offering freedom, but their insistence on achievement could be suffocating. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are wrong. It's a balance between encouraging exploration and imposing expectations. If the parents are pressuring Ellie to achieve without considering her interests or stress levels, that's an issue. However, wanting her to engage in activities is normal. The key here is the approach. Are they being overbearing by labeling doing nothing as unacceptable? Or are they just trying to guide her towards a more active lifestyle?\n\nAlso, the fact that Ellie is resistant and feels controlled implies that the parents' approach might not be supportive enough. Teenagers need autonomy. If the parents are not respecting her choice to not participate in activities, even if it's not ideal, that could be where they're wrong. However, if they're providing opportunities and gently encouraging her to find her passion without forcing it, maybe not. But the line between encouragement and pressure is thin here.\n\nIn the end, the parents' desire for their child to have interests and skills is understandable, but their method of pushing for excellence without her buy-in might be the problem. The daughter's reaction suggests that the approach is causing tension, which could mean the parents need to adjust their strategy, perhaps by being more flexible and less focused on being the best. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because pushing for excellence without considering the child's interests and autonomy could be harmful.\n"
