And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, and uses her phone and TV as main hobbies. The parents are trying to get her into various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing her to choose specific things but want her to be good at something.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel concerned about their daughter's future, wanting her to have skills or passions that could lead to success. But is pushing for excellence the right approach? Maybe they're worried about her not having direction, which is understandable. However, the daughter is a teenager, a time when identity and interests often develop. Forcing her to be \"the best\" might not be appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter isn't into anything. Parents often encourage their kids to explore activities, which is good. But the key here is the pressure to be the best. The parents are okay with her choosing whatever she wants as long as she's good at it. That phrasing might be the issue. Are they allowing her to find her own path or setting up unrealistic expectations? If they're pushing for excellence in any field without considering her interests, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the daughter feels controlled. Even if the parents aren't forcing specific activities, the underlying pressure to excel might make her feel suffocated. Teenagers need autonomy. If the parents are emphasizing that she must be good at something, it might stifle her natural interests and lead to resentment. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto her, thinking that being good at something is essential, but that's not necessarily the case for everyone.\n\nBut then again, is it wrong to have high expectations? Maybe not inherently, but the approach matters. The parents should support her in exploring different things without the pressure of being the best. It's possible they're conflating having a hobby or interest with being excellent at it. Not everyone needs to be the best; having a passion is enough.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some cultures emphasize excelling in specific areas, while others value personal happiness and exploration. The daughter's resistance might stem from feeling that her parents don't accept her current state. The parents might not be wrong in wanting her to be involved, but the insistence on being good could be the issue. They should focus on encouraging participation without the pressure of excellence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents might be in the wrong for imposing the need to be the best, not for encouraging activities. The answer could be A, but I need to check if the question hinges on whether expecting excellence is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the parents are right to encourage involvement but wrong in the method. The key is the pressure for excellence versus exploration. Since the daughter is 15, she's still figuring things out, and the parents' approach might be too rigid. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
