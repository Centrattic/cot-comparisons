And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not really into anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something, even though they let her choose what it is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting expectations. Parents often want their kids to have hobbies or interests that they're good at, which can build confidence and skills. But there's a line between encouraging and pressuring. The parents here say they're letting her choose but want her to be good. The daughter feels controlled, even if the parents don't think they are.\n\nThe parents are introducing her to various activities, which is good, but if she's not interested, maybe they're forcing her too much. The key point is that the daughter is resisting and feels controlled. Even if the parents aren't specific about what she should do, the underlying pressure to be \"the best\" might be the issue. Maybe the parents should respect her autonomy more, especially if she's not showing interest in any of the suggested activities. The daughter's well-being and genuine interests are important. If the parents are making her feel like doing nothing is unacceptable, that could be harmful. So, the parents might be in the wrong for not accepting her current state and pushing her despite her resistance. So, answer A.\n"
