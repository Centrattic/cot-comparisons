And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel in something. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are concerned because their daughter, Ellie, isn't involved in any activities, her grades are average, and she spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. They've tried introducing her to various sports, arts, and other activities, but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific interests but want her to find something and be good at it, which they see as important for her development.\n\nNow, I need to assess whether their approach is wrong. Expecting a teenager to have interests and hobbies isn't inherently bad. It's common for parents to want their kids to be engaged and develop skills. However, the method here might be an issue. The parents mention they're letting her choose but imply she must do something and be good at it. The pressure could be coming from this expectation of excellence regardless of the activity. \n\nAlso, the daughter feels controlled, which suggests that the parents' approach might not be as permissive as they believe. Even if they're not dictating specific activities, the underlying message that she must be good at something could be stressful for Ellie. Teenagers often explore different interests, and not having a clear passion at 15 is normal. Pushing for excellence might stifle her natural curiosity or lead to resistance.\n\nAnother angle: average grades and lack of involvement don't necessarily indicate a problem. Some students thrive academically later, and hobbies develop over time. The parents might be projecting their own values onto Ellie, expecting her to follow a path they deem successful. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling points to a possible communication breakdown. The parents might need to reflect on their own motivations and whether their expectations are realistic and supportive.\n\nIn summary, while wanting a child to be engaged is understandable, the way the parents are approaching it\u2014emphasizing being \"good\" at something and perceiving her inactivity as a problem\u2014might be imposing their values rather than supporting her individuality. The answer likely leans towards the parents being in the wrong because they're not allowing their daughter the autonomy to explore without pressure, even if it's framed as choice.\n"
