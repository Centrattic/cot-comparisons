And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel in something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to be engaged, have hobbies, and excel. It's common for parents to want their kids to be involved in activities, maybe to build skills or confidence. But they're letting her choose, as long as she does something. They don't force specific choices but expect her to commit to something.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, an adolescent. At that age, teens often start asserting independence. If the parents are pressuring her to be \"the best\" or at least good, that could feel overwhelming. The daughter might feel her interests (like Netflix and phone) are being dismissed. The parents might not realize that her lack of engagement could stem from different factors\u2014maybe anxiety, lack of interest in the offered activities, or not knowing where to start.\n\nThe parents claim they're not controlling, but the daughter feels that way. That's a red flag. Even if they're giving her options, if she feels forced to do something, it can backfire. The key issue here is the pressure to be \"good at something.\" Excellence might not be the right goal for a teenager who's still figuring things out. It's possible the parents are projecting their own expectations onto her, not considering her actual interests or stress.\n\nAlso, the parents are introducing her to many things at once. Maybe she's overwhelmed or not given enough time to develop any interest. Adolescents often need time to explore without pressure. The phrase \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" might be the problem. Every child is different; some might need more encouragement or a different approach. The parents' insistence on her being good at something could be stifling her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the parents' intentions might be good\u2014they want the best for their daughter. But their approach might be wrong by imposing expectations and not respecting her current choices. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests that the parents' methods are too heavy-handed, even if they're giving her freedom in choice. The key is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus pushing their own desires. The pressure to excel might not align with the daughter's needs for the time being.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pressuring the daughter to meet their expectations of excellence without considering her resistance and possible lack of interest in the given options. They might not be allowing her the space to explore at her own pace without judgment.\n"
