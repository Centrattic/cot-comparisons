And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe parent says their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. Her grades are average, and she doesn't do much at home except watch Netflix and use her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, music, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents feel they're not being controlling but want her to engage in something and be good at it, as doing nothing isn't acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the parents are pushing for Ellie to find a hobby or skill where she excels, which they see as important. But Ellie is resistant, feeling controlled. The question is whether the parents are wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspective of the parents. They might be worried about Ellie's future or her lack of direction. At 15, it's a time when kids start to explore interests, and the parents might feel that having a skill or hobby is important for personal development, college, or future career. They're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose and commit to something. However, they do emphasize that she must be good at it, not just participate. That part might be problematic because the pressure to excel could add stress.\n\nNow, Ellie's perspective: she's a teenager, which is a time when identity and independence are developing. She might feel that her parents are imposing their expectations onto her, even if they're not dictating the specific activity. The fact that she's calling them controlling suggests she feels her autonomy is being restricted. Also, the parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something, which might not align with Ellie's own interests or self-perception. She might prefer to not have pressure and just do what she wants, even if it's not what her parents consider \"productive.\"\n\nI should think about the balance between parental guidance and teen autonomy. Parents often have the best intentions, wanting their children to have opportunities and develop skills. However, teens need space to explore their own interests without external pressure. The parents in this case might be overstepping by insisting that Ellie must commit to something and excel, even if she doesn't feel motivated. The key point is that Ellie isn't into anything, which could be due to various factors like lack of interest, social anxiety, or not knowing where to start. Forcing her to engage in activities she resists might backfire, leading to resistance and further disengagement.\n\nAlso, the parents mention they've tried introducing her to various activities. If she's not connecting with any of them, maybe the approach is too broad or not tailored to her interests. The pressure to be \"good\" at something might be creating a fear of failure, making her avoid trying new things. It's possible that Ellie is in a phase where she's not sure what she likes yet, and the parents' insistence is adding stress instead of support.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of \"being good at something.\" The parents might equate this with success or achievement, which might not be how Ellie perceives her own progress. Maybe she's capable of being good at something but hasn't found the right fit yet. Alternatively, she might not value the activities the parents are suggesting. The parents' approach could be too rigid, not allowing her to explore at her own pace without judgment.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative parenting (which balances support with reasonable expectations) is generally seen as beneficial. However, if the parents are more authoritarian, setting strict demands without considering the child's input, that could be harmful. The line between support and control is thin here. The parents might be trying to encourage Ellie, but their enforcement that she must be good at something could be too controlling.\n\nAdditionally, the parents' reaction to Ellie calling them controlling is important. If they dismiss her feelings and continue pushing, it could damage their relationship. Validating her feelings and working with her to find a middle ground might be more effective. For example, discussing why she feels pressured, understanding her interests, and offering more flexible options.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be too controlling and not respecting Ellie's autonomy and current interests. The emphasis on excelling in something specific could be adding pressure rather than providing support. Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong by not allowing Ellie the freedom to explore at her own pace without the expectation of excelling.\n"
