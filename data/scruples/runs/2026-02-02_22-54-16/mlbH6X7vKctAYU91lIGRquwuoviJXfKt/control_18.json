And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter isn't involved in anything, just watching TV and using her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but the daughter is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting approaches. Encouraging a child to explore interests is normal, but pushing too hard can be problematic. The parent here says they're letting the daughter choose, but they still want her to be good at something. That line between support and pressure is important. \n\nThe daughter is 15, an age where autonomy is developing. If the parents are pressuring her to find a passion, it might be stifling her independence. The daughter feeling controlled suggests the approach might be too heavy-handed. The parent's insistence on being \"good\" at something could be setting unrealistic expectations. \n\nHowever, the parents' concern about their daughter being \"aimless\" is valid from their perspective. They might be worried about her future, which is a common parent concern. But the way they're handling it\u2014introducing many options without letting her find her own path\u2014could be the issue. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") indicates tension. Parents wanting their child to engage in activities is understandable, but the method here might be contributing to the problem. The key is whether the pressure is causing harm versus healthy encouragement. \n\nIn summary, while the parents' intentions might be good, the approach seems to lack respect for the daughter's autonomy and interests. So, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
