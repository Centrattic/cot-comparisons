And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to excel at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't involved in any activities, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. They're trying to encourage her to find a passion or skill but feel frustrated because she's resistant and labels them as controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want Ellie to have hobbies or interests beyond passive activities, which is a common concern. At 15, adolescence is a time when teens often explore their identities, and some might not have found their niche yet. The parents are trying various activities, which shows they're supportive. However, they're emphasizing that she needs to be \"good at something,\" which might be where the issue lies.\n\nNow, from Ellie's viewpoint, being 15 means she's navigating adolescence, which includes developing independence. Feeling pushed by parents to pursue certain activities can lead to resistance. The parent mentions that Ellie called them controlling, which suggests a conflict in autonomy. The pressure to excel in something, even if the activity is self-chosen, might be too much for Ellie, especially if she's not interested in any of the options presented.\n\nThe key here is the balance between encouragement and pressure. The parents are allowing her to choose but are insistent that she must be good at something. This could be seen as imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's personal interests or the time she needs to explore. Adolescents often need space to discover their own passions without feeling forced. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that the parents have a standard of excellence that Ellie must meet, which might not be realistic or appropriate for her developmental stage.\n\nAdditionally, the parents' frustration might stem from their own values or experiences, but it's important to recognize that each child is different. What worked for the parents might not resonate with their daughter. The fact that Ellie is not engaging in activities and is passive could be due to various factors like social anxiety, lack of interest, or simply not having found the right fit yet. Pressuring her might exacerbate the problem, leading to resentment or further disengagement.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative approaches tend to balance guidance with flexibility. If the parents are pushing for excellence without understanding Ellie's motivations or providing support in a way that respects her autonomy, they might be overstepping. The line between being supportive and being controlling can be thin, and the parents' insistence on her being \"good at something\" might cross that line, especially if Ellie feels coerced.\n\nMoreover, the parents' mention of introducing her to various activities is positive, but if Ellie isn't showing interest, it's possible that the methods of introduction aren't resonating with her. It's also possible that the parents are not giving her enough time to explore or are not considering her input in choosing activities. Encouragement should be about fostering intrinsic motivation rather than enforcing external achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be contributing to the conflict. The emphasis on being \"good at something\" without considering Ellie's interests and autonomy could be where they're in the wrong. It's important for parents to support their children's self-discovery without imposing their own expectations. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
