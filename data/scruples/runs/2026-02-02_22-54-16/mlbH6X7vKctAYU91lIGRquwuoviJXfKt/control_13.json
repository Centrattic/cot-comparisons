And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ellie, is not into anything. She's average in school and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, arts, academics, etc., but she's resistant and even called them controlling. The parents are pushing her to choose something she's good at but aren't forcing specific choices. \n\nNow, I need to consider the perspective of both the parents and the daughter. From the parents' side, they might be concerned about their daughter's future and her lack of direction. They want her to have hobbies or skills, which can be beneficial for her development. However, they're introducing her to various activities, which might be overwhelming or not allowing her to explore her own interests at her own pace.\n\nOn Ellie's side, being 15, she's in a stage where identity and autonomy are important. Feeling pushed to excel without genuine interest could lead to resentment. The parents mention they're not forcing specific activities, but the pressure to be \"good at something\" might come across as controlling. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels her autonomy is being threatened, which is a common issue in adolescence.\n\nNow, considering if the parents are in the wrong. The line between support and pressure can be blurry. The parents might have good intentions, but their approach could be too rigid. Adolescents need space to explore and find their interests without pressure from parents. Forcing or pressuring a child to excel in something they don't genuinely want to do can lead to burnout, stress, and a strained parent-child relationship. \n\nHowever, the parents aren't dictating specific activities, but they are emphasizing the need to be good at something. The key issue here is whether the parents are respecting Ellie's autonomy. If they're pushing her to have some form of engagement without considering her preferences, it could be seen as overbearing. The daughter's calling them controlling suggests that her perception is negative, which might indicate that the parents' approach is problematic.\n\nIn terms of psychological development, adolescents often need to develop a sense of competence and autonomy. If the parents are undermining her autonomy by pressuring her to be good at something, even if it's for her benefit, it might hinder her intrinsic motivation. It's possible the parents are not in the wrong entirely, but their methods could be improved to support Ellie's self-determination.\n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their expectations and actions are reasonable. While having expectations isn't inherently wrong, the pressure to excel in something without considering the child's interests and autonomy can be. The parents' insistence on her being \"the best\" or \"good at something\" without her own drive might be too much. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because they are imposing their expectations without sufficient regard for Ellie's autonomy and interests.\n"
