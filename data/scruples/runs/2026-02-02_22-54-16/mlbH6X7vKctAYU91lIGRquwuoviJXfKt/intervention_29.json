And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are concerned their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything. She's not involved in activities, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents want her to be good at something, any something, and they've tried introducing her to various activities. But she's resisting and even called them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing her to do specific things, just wanting her to choose something and excel at it.\n\nNow, the user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, from a parenting perspective, is it reasonable to expect a teenager to have interests and hobbies? Well, teens often go through phases of trying out activities, and sometimes they find their passion later. But the parents are pushing for her to be good at something, which might not be the case. The daughter is 15, so she might still be figuring out her interests. The parents are trying different activities, which is good, but if the daughter is resistant, maybe the pressure is coming through. \n\nThe parents say they're not controlling, but the daughter feels that way. That's a big red flag. If a child feels pressured or forced, even if the parents think they're being supportive, the child's perception matters. The parents' goal is valid\u2014wanting their child to be engaged and have skills\u2014but the approach might be the issue. The daughter might need to explore on her own without the pressure of \"being good.\" Maybe she's not ready yet, or the parents' expectations are too high. \n\nAlso, expecting a teenager to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something can be stressful. It's possible the parents are projecting their own values onto their child, not considering that the daughter might have different priorities or interests that don't align with traditional \"good\" activities. The daughter's well-being and autonomy are important. Forcing her into something she's not interested in could lead to resentment or burnout. \n\nHowever, the parents' concern about aimlessness isn't unfounded. Engaging in activities can help build confidence and skills. But the method here seems to be about trying to push the daughter into something without her buy-in. The key issue might be the pressure to excel rather than just finding something she enjoys. \n\nSo, in this case, the parents might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's current lack of interest and pushing for excellence rather than supporting her in exploring her own path. The daughter's feeling of being controlled suggests that the parents are imposing their expectations, even if they think they're being supportive. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the pressure and the daughter's reaction indicate that the approach is problematic.\n"
