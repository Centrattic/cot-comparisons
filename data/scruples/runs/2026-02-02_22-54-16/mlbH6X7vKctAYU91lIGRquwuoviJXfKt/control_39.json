And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15, not involved in any activities, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents want her to excel at something, but she's not interested. They've tried introducing her to various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing specific things but want her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about their daughter's future, wanting her to have skills or passions that can lead to opportunities. They might fear she's not developing direction or discipline. But their approach could be problematic. Pressuring a teenager to excel in any area without considering her interests might lead to resistance, as shown by Ellie's reaction. The parent mentions they're letting her choose, but the underlying push for excellence might still feel controlling. \n\nEllie is 15, which is a time when teens are forming their own identities. If the parents are pushing her to be the best without her interest, it could undermine her autonomy. The parent's focus on being \"good at something\" might not align with Ellie's personal goals or passions. Also, the parent's list of activities\u2014sports, art, music, etc.\u2014are all common extracurriculars, but maybe Ellie doesn't find any of them appealing. The parent's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be supportive. They might be projecting their own values onto Ellie without respecting her individuality.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents could be right to encourage some level of engagement, as having hobbies can build confidence and skills. However, the key here is the expectation to be \"the best\" and the pressure to conform to their idea of a well-rounded life. The daughter's response of feeling controlled suggests that the pressure is coming through, even if the parents don't see themselves as controlling. The parent's reasoning that \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" might not consider that Ellie's current state could be a phase or that she's exploring her interests in her own way.\n\nI should also consider if there's an underlying issue, like anxiety or burnout, but the question doesn't mention that. The main conflict is about expectations versus autonomy. The parents are pushing for excellence in any field, which might not account for Ellie's personality or what she values. The fact that she's choosing to spend time on tv and phone could be her way of decompressing, and the parents might not be acknowledging that. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be imposing their values without respecting Ellie's autonomy and interests. The answer would lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because the pressure to excel in any domain they choose could be overbearing and not considering the daughter's own desires.\n"
