And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The author is a parent who's concerned that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to excel at something, even if they're not dictating what that something is. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents aren't forcing her into a specific activity but are encouraging her to engage in any activity where she can be good. They might be worried about her future or her social development. But there's a line between encouragement and pressure. At 15, teenagers are figuring out their interests and identities. Pushing for excellence in any area might be stressful for Ellie.\n\nThe parents mention they're letting her choose what to do, but the underlying expectation is that she must be good at it. That could create pressure. If the daughter feels like she's being forced to find a passion just because the parents want her to be \"good at something,\" it might backfire. It's possible the parents are projecting their own desires onto Ellie, maybe feeling she needs a clear path or achievements. However, not all teenagers have clear interests yet, and some may develop them later. \n\nAlso, the parents' approach of introducing her to many activities could be overwhelming. Maybe Ellie is trying different things and hasn't found the right fit yet. But the parents frame it as her not wanting to do anything. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured even if the parents think they're not being controlling. \n\nAnother angle: the parents' definition of success might be too narrow. If they're equating having a hobby or activity with being \"good at something,\" they might be overlooking other strengths Ellie might have. Maybe she's more of a thinker, or prefers solo activities not mentioned, or is creative in ways they don't recognize. \n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's about balance. Encouragement is okay, but pushing for excellence or specific achievements without considering the child's autonomy could be problematic. The parents might not be wrong in wanting the best for their child, but their approach could be too controlling or not respecting Ellie's need to explore and find her own path without external pressure. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations without allowing their daughter to develop naturally.\n"
