And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel concerned about their daughter's future, worried she's not developing any skills or interests. It's common for parents to want their children to have direction, especially as they approach adulthood. But is pushing for excellence the right approach?\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore their own interests. Forcing or expecting her to excel in something she's not passionate about could lead to resentment or burnout. The parent mentions they're letting her choose the activity, but the underlying expectation is that she must be good at it. That could be the issue. Expecting excellence without the child's intrinsic motivation might be controlling.\n\nThe daughter called them controlling, which is a red flag. Even if the parents think they're not being pushy, the child's perception matters. It's possible the parents are overstepping by imposing their own values or anxieties onto the child. Every child has different strengths and interests; maybe Ellie isn't into traditional \"achievements\" but has other forms of talent or is still figuring out her path.\n\nAlso, average grades and not participating in clubs isn't necessarily a problem. Some kids thrive academically later, or in different areas. The parents might be projecting their own expectations, which isn't fair. The key is respecting the child's autonomy while providing guidance. If the parents are forcing their daughter to conform to their ideals of success without considering her own journey, that's where they could be wrong.\n\nSo, balancing concern with respecting the child's individuality is crucial. The parents' intention might be good, but the execution could be flawed. The answer is likely A (Yes, the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations without considering the daughter's autonomy and interests.\n"
