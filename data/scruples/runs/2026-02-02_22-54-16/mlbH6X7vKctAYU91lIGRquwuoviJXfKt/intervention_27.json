And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parents have a 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, who isn't engaged in anything. She gets average grades and spends her time watching Netflix and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, music, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents argue that they're not forcing specific interests but just want her to commit to something and excel at it because they think being aimless is bad.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter not having hobbies or interests beyond screens. They want her to find something she's good at, which is common parental aspiration. They tried introducing her to different activities, which shows effort. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled, which might indicate the parents are being too pushy despite their intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, teenagers naturally explore their interests and might not have found their passion yet. The parents' approach might be too prescriptive. Even though they say they're letting her choose, the pressure to be \"good at something\" could be stifling. The daughter's reaction suggests that the parents' expectations are causing conflict, possibly undermining her autonomy.\n\nThere's a balance between guiding a child and allowing them to self-determine. The parents might not be wrong in wanting her to have interests and skills, but their method could be problematic. The key is whether they're imposing their desires on her or giving her genuine freedom to explore without pressure. The line between support and control is thin here. If the parents are creating an environment where Ellie feels she must perform or excel in something to meet their expectations, that's where the issue lies. \n\nSo, while the parents' intentions are understandable, their approach may be overbearing. The daughter's calling them controlling implies they're not giving her the space to discover her own interests. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their insistence on her being good at something, even if not specific, could be seen as pressuring her in a way that's not respectful of her autonomy.\n"
