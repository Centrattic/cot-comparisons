And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The situation is that Ellie, 15, isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, like sports, art, etc., and they've tried introducing her to various activities. They feel she's being aimless, so they push her to commit to something. She called them controlling, but they say they're not forcing specific things, just that she needs to do something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and skills outside of just school and screen time. It's common for parents to encourage their kids to develop hobbies or talents, as it can build confidence, discipline, and a sense of achievement. However, the key here might be how they're approaching it. The daughter feels pressured, even if the parents aren't dictating what she should do. The fact that she called them controlling suggests that the pressure might be coming through in a way that's not supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, an adolescent, and this is a time when teens often explore their interests. Forcing or strongly pushing a child to excel in something might not be effective if it's not something she's genuinely interested in. The parents might be imposing their own values or fears about not having direction. It's possible they're concerned about her future or her social life, but pushing her without her consent could backfire, leading to resistance and a lack of intrinsic motivation.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' approach. They mention they're letting her choose anything, but they still have the expectation that she must be good at it. This could be the issue. Encouraging exploration without the pressure to excel might be more beneficial. If she's not into any of the activities they've introduced, maybe they need to consider that she's still figuring out what interests her, or that the right activity hasn't been presented yet. Also, the daughter's current habits (TV and phone) might be her way of coping or relaxing, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if she's content and not neglecting responsibilities.\n\nThe parents might be in the wrong if their expectations are unrealistic or if their approach is causing stress and resentment. The daughter's resistance is a sign that their methods aren't working. It's important for parents to support their child's autonomy while still guiding them. However, it's also natural for parents to want their children to have pursuits beyond school and screens. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the parents' intention is understandable, but their execution might be problematic. The pressure to be \"good at something\" without allowing the daughter to explore at her own pace could be the issue. The daughter's reaction indicates that their approach isn't resonating, so maybe the parents need to adjust their strategy. They should focus on fostering interest rather than enforcing achievement. Therefore, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because their expectations and methods are causing conflict and not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n"
