And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, who isn't into anything and they want her to be good at something. The author and their husband are trying to get her involved in various activities, but she's resistant and calls them controlling. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parents are concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement. They're introducing her to different activities, but she's not interested. They want her to develop a skill or hobby, which is a common parental desire. However, the daughter feels pressured and calls them controlling. The key here is the balance between encouraging a child versus being overbearing.\n\nThe parents say they're not forcing her to do something specific, just that she \"has to do something and be good at it.\" The problem is that by setting a condition that she must be good at whatever she chooses, they might be inadvertently creating pressure. The daughter's resistance could stem from feeling that any choice she makes is under scrutiny to meet a standard of excellence. This might lead to anxiety or rebellion, making her disengage further.\n\nAlso, at 15, teenagers often explore their interests and may not have found their passion yet. The parents might be expecting too much too soon. The daughter's current hobbies (Netflix, phone) are passive and might not be what the parents want, but they are valid ways for a teen to spend time. The parents' approach of trying everything could be overwhelming for her, leading to the label of \"controlling.\"\n\nAnother angle is the communication. If the parents are pushing without understanding Ellie's perspective, they might come across as controlling. The daughter's feeling that they're controlling suggests that the parents' methods aren't effective. It's possible that the parents need to step back, offer support without pressure, and let Ellie find her own interests without the expectation of being \"the best.\"\n\nIn terms of whether the parents are in the wrong, it's a judgment call. They have valid concerns about their daughter's development, but their approach might be contributing to the problem. The line between support and control is thin here. The daughter's reaction indicates that the current approach isn't working. The parents might need to adjust their strategy, focusing on encouragement rather than mandatory excellence. So, while their intent is good, their method could be part of the issue. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong (A), but there's a middle ground where both sides have some responsibility.\n"
