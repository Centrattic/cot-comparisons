And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The parent is upset because their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities, but she's resisting and calling them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific interests but want her to choose something and excel at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or skills, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not pushing their own interests but allowing her to choose. However, the daughter feels pressured. At 15, teenagers often seek independence, so the parents' approach might come across as controlling even if they aren't being overbearing. \n\nThe key point is whether expecting a teenager to engage in activities beyond school and screen time is unreasonable. Parents want their kids to develop skills and interests, which can be beneficial. But the method matters. If the parents are creating an environment where Ellie feels forced to choose something without genuine interest, that could be problematic. The daughter's reaction as \"controlling\" suggests she perceives pressure, even if the parents think they're giving her freedom.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities are passive (Netflix, phone), and the parents are concerned about her being aimless. It's valid to encourage exploration, but how that's done is crucial. The parents might be in the wrong if their approach is more about wanting her to excel for their own satisfaction rather than her well-being. However, if they're genuinely concerned about her future and trying to help her find a passion, they might not be at fault. \n\nAnother angle: teens often go through phases where they don't have strong interests. The parents might not be wrong in wanting to push her to find something, but their implementation could be too rigid. The answer might hinge on the balance between guidance and pressure. Since the daughter is resisting and feeling controlled, the parents might need to adjust their approach. But whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on perspective. Some might see it as normal parenting concern, others as overstepping. In the AITA context, the community often values the child's autonomy. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations despite the daughter's resistance. But I'm not sure. The parent's intention is good, but the execution could be problematic. Hmm.\n"
