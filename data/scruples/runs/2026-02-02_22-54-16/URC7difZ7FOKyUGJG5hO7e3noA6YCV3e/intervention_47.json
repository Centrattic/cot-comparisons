It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for allowing their mom to stay with their wife after having a child. \n\nFirst, the main issue is the division of housework. The author mentions that their wife has been doing very little housework since the baby was born, which is causing strain. They tried to communicate but the wife is unresponsive, saying she's too exhausted. The author then reaches out to their mom, who offers help. However, when the author suggests it, the wife gets angry and doesn't want her help, so the author goes ahead anyway.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication between the couple, the wife's refusal to contribute, the author's exhaustion, and the mom's involvement. The author's actions were to alleviate the stress, but the wife feels undermined. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, involving a parent without the spouse's consent can be a problem. The wife might feel that her ability to handle things is being questioned, especially if the author didn't make a genuine effort to resolve it together. But the author also tried asking for help and it didn't work. The mom's help did improve the author's situation, but it caused tension with the wife. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author was trying to take care of their own well-being, which is important. On the other, inviting a parent without the spouse's agreement can lead to conflict. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author's burnout is also a real issue. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They made attempts to resolve the problem, and after those failed, bringing in help was a reasonable step to manage the situation. However, the approach might not have been ideal, and communication could have been better. But in the context of the problem, their action wasn't wrong.\n"
