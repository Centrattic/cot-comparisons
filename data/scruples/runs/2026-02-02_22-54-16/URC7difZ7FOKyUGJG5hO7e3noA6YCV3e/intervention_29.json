It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after having a baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He's doing most of the housework, which he's been doing even before the baby. Now, with the baby, his wife is doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours and comes home exhausted. He's tried talking to his wife about the imbalance but she's not helping. He then confides in his mom, who offers to come stay and help. He tells his wife, but she gets angry and insists they can handle it. He then goes ahead and invites his mom anyway after a week, leading to tension.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is dealing with a significant workload, both at work and at home. His wife isn't contributing to the housework, which he's already found challenging before the baby. The mom's help is a relief for him, but the wife feels her autonomy is undermined. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by bringing in his mom without his wife's consent.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is trying to manage the household with support when his wife isn't contributing. However, the way he did it\u2014without consulting his wife properly and going ahead after she was against it\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. Marriage typically requires mutual agreement on major decisions, especially those involving family. By unilaterally inviting his mom, he might have disregarded his wife's feelings and their relationship. But on the other hand, he felt he had no choice due to the unsustainable situation.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also valid. She might feel that her autonomy is respected when her partner makes decisions without her. The friend's comment about undermining the wife points to possible emotional harm. The author's action might have caused more conflict than solving the problem, especially since the mom's presence now seems to create a cold dynamic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's in a tough spot, but the method he chose could be problematic. He should have tried to find a solution together with his wife first. However, the root issue is the unequal division of labor, which is his wife's contribution (or lack thereof). The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding family roles and decision-making. In many cases, making unilateral decisions without considering the spouse's feelings can be seen as wrong, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue collaboratively, even if the problem lies with the wife's lack of help.\n"
