It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing his mom to stay with his wife after the birth of their child. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The main issue is housework. The wife used to split it 65/35 but now does almost none, especially after the baby. The author works 45 hours a week and does all the housework. He tried talking to his wife, but she says she's too exhausted. The author's mom offered to help, and when he told his wife, she was angry and refused. The author then invited his mom anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author's actions: He sought help from his mom because he was overwhelmed. But he didn't get his wife's permission first. The wife felt undermined, which led to her being upset. The friend of the wife also commented on that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, he's stressed and overworked, trying to manage everything. His mom's help relieved some pressure, which is understandable. But by bringing his mom in without his wife's consent, even after she refused, might be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important here. She might feel that her autonomy in the household decisions is being ignored. Even if the author was struggling, involving his mom without her agreement could be seen as not respecting her wishes. However, the wife wasn't doing any housework, so maybe the author felt he had no choice. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting the wife's feelings and addressing his own needs. The author did try to communicate, and when that failed, he took action. The friend's comment suggests that the wife felt disrespected. \n\nBut the housework issue is a significant problem. If the wife isn't contributing, and the author is doing everything, leading to burnout, bringing in help might be necessary. However, the way it was done might have been the problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to talk, but the wife wasn't listening. The mom's help might have been a last resort. However, involving family without consent can complicate things, especially if it's done without mutual agreement. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one side, he's trying to manage a stressful situation and get help. On the other, not respecting his wife's wishes could be problematic. Maybe the answer is that he's not entirely in the wrong because he's dealing with burnout, but he could have handled it better by finding another solution first. However, since the options were either continued stress or bringing in help, he might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he didn't consider other options (like couples counseling or setting stricter boundaries), maybe he is. But given the situation, his actions were to protect his own well-being and the family's, so perhaps he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
