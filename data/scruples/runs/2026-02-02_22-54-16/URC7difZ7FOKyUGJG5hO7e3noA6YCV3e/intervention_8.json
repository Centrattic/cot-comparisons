It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having their mom stay with them after their baby was born because their wife isn't helping with housework. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband is doing most of the housework, which was already an issue before the baby (65/35 split, sometimes worse). After the baby, the wife does even less, focusing only on baby-related tasks. The husband works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and has to do all the chores. He tried talking to his wife, who says she's too tired. \n\nHe then tells his mom, who offers to help. When he suggests it to his wife, she gets angry and refuses. The husband, feeling overwhelmed, brings his mom in without his wife's consent. Now the wife is upset, and the mom is being cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are the unequal division of labor, the husband's frustration leading to bringing in his mom without consent, and the resulting conflict. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if he's at fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibilities, both parents should share in childcare and housework. The wife isn't contributing, which is a problem. The husband tried to communicate but was met with resistance. His decision to bring in his mom was to manage the stress and get some help, which is understandable. But did he overstep by doing it without his wife's permission? \n\nThere's a valid concern about respecting the wife's autonomy. However, if the wife is unwilling to help and the situation is causing significant stress, maybe the husband's action was necessary for his well-being. The problem is that he didn't resolve the communication issues first. Maybe he should have tried more to find a compromise or seek counseling instead of bringing in his mom as a solution. \n\nBut given the context that he tried talking and got no support, and the situation was affecting his mental health, his decision might be seen as a last resort. However, bringing in his mom without his wife's consent could be seen as undermining her, even if the intention was good. \n\nSo, there's a balance between self-care and respecting the spouse's wishes. The husband's action might be justified in terms of his need for help, but the method could be questioned. However, in many cases, parents do step in to help after a child is born, especially in traditional roles. \n\nThe friend's comment is about undermining the wife, but the husband's perspective is that he's trying to survive. It's a complex situation. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. He tried to address the problem, his mom wanted to help, and the wife's refusal led to an impasse. The husband's action was a way to get relief and support, even if it upset his wife. So, the answer is B.\n"
