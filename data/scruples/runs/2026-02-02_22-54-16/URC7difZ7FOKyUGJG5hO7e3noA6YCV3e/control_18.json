It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing his mom to come stay with them after their baby was born. The situation involves a lot of household responsibilities and exhaustion.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and his wife have a history of unequal housework, with him doing the majority. After the baby, his wife stops doing any housework except baby-related tasks. He works long hours and feels overwhelmed. He tried talking to her, but she's too tired. Then his mom offers help, which he accepts, leading to his wife being upset.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author do something wrong by inviting his mom without his wife's consent? \n\nFrom one angle, the author is trying to manage the household and his own stress. He's been asking his wife to help without success. Using his mom's offer to alleviate the burden might be seen as reasonable, especially if he felt he was at his breaking point. It's about self-care and preventing burnout. Also, the wife's cold and possessive behavior towards the baby might add to the problem. The author might think he's acting in the best interest of the family by getting the help they need.\n\nOn the flip side, involving a parent in a family dispute without the spouse's agreement could be seen as undermining the spouse. The wife might feel disrespected or that her efforts aren't recognized. Even if she's not contributing to housework, the author bypassing her in a decision that affects their household could create more tension. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014maybe they needed to work out the housework division together instead of bringing in an external helper.\n\nThe author's actions might be justified if the situation was causing significant distress and they couldn't resolve it through discussion. However, the method of inviting his mom without consulting his wife first could be problematic. It might have been better to have a more collaborative approach, perhaps involving counseling or a mediator if the housework issue was that severe.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance between self-care and respecting the spouse's autonomy. The author's intention was to reduce his own stress and improve their living conditions, but the way he did it might have hurt his wife's feelings. So, while his actions were out of necessity, the method could be questioned. But whether that makes him in the wrong depends on cultural expectations and how they handle family dynamics.\n"
