It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person is at fault for having their mom come stay after their wife isn't helping with the housework. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband mentions that even before the baby, the housework split was unequal, maybe 65/35 or worse. Now, with the baby, the wife is doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The husband works 45 hours, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too tired. He tried to get help from his mom, but the wife was angry when he told her. He then went ahead and invited his mom without her permission when the situation didn't improve.\n\nSo, the main points here are the division of labor, communication issues, and the decision to bring in his mom without his wife's consent. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's overwhelmed, trying to manage work, baby, and all the housework. He's reached out to his wife, who isn't helping. His mom offers help, which he gratefully accepts. But when the wife objects, he proceeds anyway. That seems like a problem because he didn't respect her feelings in the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her exhaustion is valid. Caring for a newborn is demanding, and maybe she's dealing with postpartum issues or stress that she hasn't communicated. Her anger could stem from feeling undermined or not being involved in the decision to bring in her mother-in-law. \n\nBringing in the mother-in-law without the spouse's consent can create tension. Even if the husband had good intentions, it's important to involve the spouse in such decisions. The wife's reaction might be partly about feeling disrespected. \n\nThe husband did try to communicate his needs, but maybe not effectively. He could have sought couples counseling or worked on communication strategies before involving his mom. By doing it without her consent, he might have acted unilaterally, which can be seen as a breach of partnership.\n\nHowever, the husband is also under a lot of stress, and his actions were to alleviate his burden. The question is whether his method was appropriate. In relationships, both partners need to collaborate on solutions. The fact that the wife didn't contribute equally and the husband didn't involve her in the decision-making process might make him at fault here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't include his wife in the decision despite her objections, which could damage their relationship. But there's also context about his stress and the wife's lack of help. It's a tricky balance. However, the act of inviting the mom without consent is a key point here.\n"
