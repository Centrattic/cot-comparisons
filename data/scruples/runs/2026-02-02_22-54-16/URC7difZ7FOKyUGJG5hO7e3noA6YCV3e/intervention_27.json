It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby because the wife isn't contributing to housework.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and wife had a baby four months ago. The wife is only doing about 35% of the housework, and after the baby, it's almost nothing. The author is working 45 hours a week and handling all the chores, which is leading to exhaustion. The author vented to his mom, who offered to help, but the wife was upset when the author invited her. The author then went ahead anyway after a week of no change.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author tried to communicate with the wife about the imbalance but didn't get the support needed. The wife claims she's too tired, but the author argues that even small contributions would help. The mom's help was a last resort after feeling burnt out. The wife's reaction was anger and feeling undermined, but the author felt it was necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author did try to talk to the wife first and only escalated when there was no change. He made it clear he was inviting the mom if things didn't improve. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her autonomy was compromised, especially if she didn't have a chance to voice her reasons properly. However, the author's primary concern was his well-being and the baby's care, given the wife's lack of support.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author undermined the wife might be true in terms of not fully resolving the issue before bringing in help. But the author was in a stressful situation where the stress was affecting his life. The mom's help improved the situation, so while the method might be questionable, the intent was to seek relief after exhausting alternatives.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to communicate, faced no change, and took steps to improve the situation after a week. The wife's reaction is valid, but the author's actions were a response to being overwhelmed. So the answer should be B.\n"
