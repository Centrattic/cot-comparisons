It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing their mom to stay with them after a baby was born, despite the wife not being happy about it. The situation is that the wife isn't doing any housework besides baby-related tasks, and the husband is handling everything else. He tried talking to her, but she said she's too exhausted. After a week of no change, he invited his mom without the wife's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The husband feels overburdened, working 45 hours a week and doing all the housework. The wife is taking care of the baby but not contributing to other chores. He's trying to communicate, but she's not helping. Then, his mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when he brings her in.\n\nIs the husband wrong for doing that? Well, he did communicate his concerns multiple times. He tried to get help from his wife and failed. The mom offered help, which was a good gesture. The wife's initial refusal might have been pride or stress, but the husband was at a breaking point. Inviting the mom without her permission could be seen as undermining her, but was it necessary?\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is doing all the work, which is unsustainable. The wife might feel overwhelmed, but even small help would make a difference. The mom's arrival provided relief, which is important for the family's well-being. However, not consulting the wife first could be a mistake because it's a joint decision. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but given the circumstances, his actions were to save himself from burnout.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He did try to talk to his wife, but when that failed, he took action. The wife might feel disrespected, but his intent was to improve the situation. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He needed help and acted to address his needs, even if the approach was a bit abrupt.\n"
