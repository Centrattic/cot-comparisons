It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after their baby was born. The situation involves household responsibilities and the wife not contributing as much as the author would like.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that before the baby, the work split was already skewed, with him doing 65-80% of the housework. After the baby, the wife is doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and has to handle all the chores. He's tried talking to his wife, but she says she's too tired from the baby. The mom offers to help, but the wife is against it. The author then goes ahead and invites his mom anyway after a week of no changes.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key here. The author tried to talk to his wife, who didn't want the help. By inviting his mom without her consent, he's making a unilateral decision. Even though the wife didn't contribute, the author's action might be seen as undermining her authority in the household. The wife's friend points out that he undermined her, which suggests that the action might have been hurtful to the wife's feelings, even if the intention was to get help.\n\nBut then again, the author is clearly overwhelmed. The wife isn't helping, leading to burnout. The mom's help provides relief. There's a balance between respecting the wife's wishes and taking action to prevent personal burnout. However, the method of inviting the mom without the wife's consent might be the issue. Maybe the author should have tried more communication or compromise first before bringing in his mom. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. He did try to talk to his wife and plead for help, but she didn't respond. The mom's help was a solution, but the way it was implemented could be problematic. It's possible that the author didn't consider that the wife might feel invaded or that her feelings weren't respected. So, while his intentions were to manage stress and share the load, the approach might have been wrong. \n\nBut in another angle, if the wife isn't contributing and the author is at the breaking point, is it his fault for seeking help when necessary? The line is thin between supporting each other as a couple and needing external help. However, in relationships, decisions like inviting someone to stay should involve mutual agreement. The author's unilateral decision might be seen as not valuing the wife's autonomy, hence putting him in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't resolve the issue with his wife first and acted without her consent, even if the intention was good. However, there's also the aspect of his well-being and the lack of cooperation from his wife. But the key point is the method: bypassing the wife's wishes. Hence, A might be the correct choice.\n"
