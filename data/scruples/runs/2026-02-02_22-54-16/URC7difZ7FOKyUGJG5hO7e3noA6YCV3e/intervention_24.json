It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author invited their mom to stay with them without asking their wife first because the wife wasn't helping with housework after having a baby. The wife got angry and said they didn't need help, but the author went ahead anyway.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to break down the key points. The author is doing most of the housework, which is causing them stress. They tried talking to their wife about it, but she didn't help. The mom offered to help, and the author felt that inviting her was necessary to relieve the burden. The wife was upset because the author didn't consult her first, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is dealing with burnout and the wife isn't contributing, so seeking help from a parent might be reasonable. On the other hand, major decisions like having a parent move in should involve both partners. The wife might feel disrespected by being overridden, especially if she believes they can handle it themselves.\n\nBut the author did mention discussing the issue with their wife before, and she didn't change her stance. The author felt they had no choice. The mom's help did ease the situation, so maybe the author's actions were necessary for their well-being. However, communication is key in relationships, and not discussing the mom's visit properly could lead to resentment. Maybe there's a middle ground where they could have set up a conversation to explain why they needed the help instead of just inviting the mom without permission.\n\nI think the author's intentions were good, but the way they went about it might have been wrong. However, the underlying issue of unequal housework is a problem too. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They might not be entirely wrong because the situation was dire, but they could have handled it better by involving their wife in the decision. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the wife perceived the action. But since the user is asking for a yes or no, I have to decide. I lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the root issue is the lack of help from the wife, and the author's action was a response to that. But maybe A if the approach was too hasty. Hmm.\n"
