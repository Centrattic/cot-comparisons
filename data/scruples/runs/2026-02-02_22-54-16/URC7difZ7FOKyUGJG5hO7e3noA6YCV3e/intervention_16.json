It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new father who's taking care of all the housework and his wife isn't helping. He invites his mom to help without his wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband mentions that he and his wife have always had a housework imbalance, with him doing 80% of the chores. After having a baby, the wife does even less. He's working 45 hours a week, which is manageable, but he's exhausted from work and then doing all the housework. He's tried to communicate with his wife, but she says she's too tired. He then involves his mom, which the wife objects to. The husband insists because he's burnt out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. He did try to talk to his wife, but it didn't work. The wife's argument is that she's too busy with the baby. But new parents need support, and sharing chores is part of that. The husband's mom offered help, so maybe he's right to accept it to prevent his own burnout. On the other hand, involving a parent without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining the wife. However, the husband was extremely exhausted and had given her a week to change, which didn't happen. So, he might have felt it was necessary for his well-being and the family's health. The wife's reaction seems to be based on pride or feeling incapable, but the husband's main issue is the lack of support. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities and take care of his family, even if the method wasn't the most diplomatic. The key is that he tried to communicate, the wife didn't help, and he sought external support to prevent further strain. So the answer should be B.\n"
