It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author did something wrong by having their mom stay with them after their baby was born, despite their wife's objections. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife had a baby four months ago. The main issue is housework distribution. The author says he does 80% of the work, and after the baby, the wife does almost none. He works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted, but still takes on all the chores and baby duty. He tried talking to his wife about it, but she's too tired and won't help. Then his mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when the author goes through with it without her consent.\n\nSo the key points here are the imbalance in household responsibilities, the author's decision to involve his mom without his wife's approval, and the resulting conflict.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, bringing in his mom might be seen as undermining his wife. The wife felt upset and was against the help, so the author's action could be perceived as not respecting her wishes. He even said he would invite his mom with or without her permission, which seems a bit controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed. He's working full time, handling all the chores, and taking care of the baby. His wife isn't contributing, and he's tried to communicate, but there's no improvement. The mom's help is a temporary solution to relieve the stress. It's understandable that he's at his breaking point and needs support. \n\nBut the way he handled it might be problematic. He didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process, which could have led to better communication. Maybe there was an opportunity to find a compromise or seek couples counseling instead of bringing in a third party without consent. \n\nHowever, the wife's refusal to do any housework, even minimal tasks, is also an issue. The author is doing all the work and it's affecting his well-being. The mom's help was a way for him to get rest and manage his responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to alleviate his stress and ensure the household runs smoothly, but the method he used might have been abrupt. However, given the circumstances, his actions could be seen as necessary for his mental health and the family's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether involving his mom without his wife's consent is considered wrong. Some might argue that he should have found another way, but others might empathize with his situation. I think the author is not in the wrong because he was trying to address a serious problem that he had already communicated to his wife without success. The wife's behavior is also a contributing factor. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
