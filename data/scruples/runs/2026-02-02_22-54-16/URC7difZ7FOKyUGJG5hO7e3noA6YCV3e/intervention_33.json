It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing their mom to stay after their wife wasn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband is doing most of the housework, which was already an issue before, but now it's worse since the wife isn't helping at all. He's working 45 hours and does all the chores. He asked his wife for help, but she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The mom offers to come stay and help, but the wife is upset when the husband proceeds without her consent.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect in the marriage. The husband tried to talk to his wife and get her to help, which is the right step. When that didn't work, he confided in his mom and then invited her over without the wife's permission. Even though the husband was struggling, cutting off communication and making a unilateral decision might harm the trust in the marriage. The wife might feel disrespected, thinking her needs weren't considered. However, the husband's actions were driven by his own exhaustion and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The husband did try to resolve the issue with his wife first, then involved his mom after she offered help. Since the wife was not cooperating despite his requests, the husband might feel it was necessary. However, he should have tried to resolve the issue with his wife first, maybe through counseling or compromise, rather than inviting his mom without her consent. The wife's reaction is valid because it's a big decision affecting their household. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the husband is partially at fault for not addressing the issue together. But considering the extreme stress of postpartum and the lack of support, his actions might be seen as desperate. The community might have mixed reactions. But the main issue is that he bypassed his wife's wishes. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, based on the typical \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) framework, if the husband broke trust or didn't communicate properly, he might be considered the asshole. So leaning towards A.\n"
