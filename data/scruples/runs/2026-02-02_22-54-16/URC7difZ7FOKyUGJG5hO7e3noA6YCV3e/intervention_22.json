It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework since having a baby. \n\nFirst, the husband and wife had a pre-existing imbalance in chores, 80/20 in his favor. After the baby, the wife stopped doing even the non-baby related tasks. He works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted, trying to handle everything. He's asked for help, but the wife says she's too tired from the baby. He reaches out to his mom, who offers to help. When he tells his wife, she's upset and refuses. He then invites the mom anyway after a week with no change.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is trying to manage his workload and the household, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal to help might be due to postpartum stress or other factors, which could be valid. But he's been trying to communicate and the situation isn't improving. Inviting his mom without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining her, especially if the wife felt it was disrespectful. However, the husband was at his breaking point and needed support. \n\nThe mom's presence did help him, but the wife's reaction suggests that there might be unmet needs or feelings of insecurity. Maybe the couple should have addressed the issue together before bringing in the mom. The husband's approach might have been hasty, but the root problem is the lack of shared responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband's intent was to alleviate his stress, which is understandable, but he didn't fully consider his wife's feelings in the process. However, his actions were a response to neglect and exhaustion. The key is whether he acted in a way that's respectful and communicative. He did mention trying to arrange it with his wife first, but she was resistant. After a week, he proceeded. Maybe there's a middle ground, but given the circumstances, his decision was a way to cope. So, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
