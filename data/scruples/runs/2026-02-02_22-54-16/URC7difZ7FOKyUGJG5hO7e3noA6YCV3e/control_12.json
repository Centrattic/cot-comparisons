It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting his mom come to stay after their child was born. The situation is that the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks, and the author is handling most of it. He tried talking to her, but she said she's too exhausted. Then he invited his mom without the wife's permission, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing 80% of the housework, which is a significant imbalance. The wife is handling the baby, which is also a lot of work. He tried to communicate his exhaustion and asked for help, but she didn't respond. That's a red flag because communication is key in relationships. \n\nThen, the author's mom offered to help. The user might think it's okay because the wife refused help. But inviting a parent without the spouse's consent can be seen as undermining them. The wife was upset and felt her friend didn't support her. The author's actions might have come off as disrespectful, even if his intentions were good. \n\nHowever, the author was at the breaking point. If the wife isn't contributing and he's overwhelmed, getting help is necessary. The problem is the method\u2014he didn't resolve the issue through mutual agreement but introduced a third party. The mom's presence might be causing additional tension, especially if the wife feels her relationship with the author is compromised by the mom's cold and possessive behavior toward the baby.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between his need for support and respecting his wife's feelings. While the wife's lack of help is an issue, inviting his mom without discussing it thoroughly might have been a poor decision. Maybe he should have tried more communication or sought other solutions first. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on the context of their communication and the necessity of the action. Since he tried to talk to her and she didn't help, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he introduced the mom might have been a mistake. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's taking action to address a problem that wasn't being resolved. But some might argue he should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n"
