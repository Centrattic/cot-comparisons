It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after his wife isn't helping with housework post-baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband is doing most of the housework, which was already an issue before the baby, and now it's worse. He tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping. He asks his mom to come help, but the wife is angry and he proceeds anyway after a week.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and consent. The husband did try to talk to his wife, but when she refused the help, he went ahead without her permission. While it's understandable that he's overwhelmed, bringing in external help without his wife's agreement might have been a breach of mutual decision-making in their relationship. However, the wife wasn't willing to address the housework issue, so maybe the husband felt he had no choice.\n\nBut in a marriage, major decisions like having a parent stay should ideally be mutual. By not getting her consent, he might have acted unilaterally, which could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, his actions were driven by exhaustion and the need for support, which is valid. It's a balance between respecting the partner's feelings and protecting one's own well-being.\n\nThe wife's anger might stem from feeling undermined, especially if she felt her wishes were disregarded. The husband's intention was to get help, but the method could be questioned. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle it collaboratively. However, if the wife wasn't open to any solution, maybe B (not in the wrong) because he took action to preserve his mental health. But the fact that he didn't discuss it further and just did it on his own might tip the scale towards A.\n"
