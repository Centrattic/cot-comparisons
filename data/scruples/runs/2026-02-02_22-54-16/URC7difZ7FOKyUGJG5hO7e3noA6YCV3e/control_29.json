It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing his mom to come stay with them after the birth of their child. The situation is that the wife isn't doing any housework, and the husband feels overwhelmed because he's working 45 hours and handling all the chores. He tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping, so he reaches out to his mom, who offers to help. When he tells his wife, she's angry and doesn't want the help, but the husband goes ahead anyway after a week of no change.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is doing all the housework, which is leading to burnout. The wife is taking care of the baby but not contributing to other chores. The husband tried to communicate his struggles, but the wife is dismissive. Then he involves his mom without the wife's consent, which caused conflict.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, involving family without the partner's agreement can be seen as a problem. The wife felt her autonomy was undermined, which could lead to more issues in the marriage. However, the husband is clearly at his breaking point, so he might feel he has no other choice. But is that a valid reason to bypass his wife's wishes?\n\nThe key points are communication and consent. The husband tried to talk to his wife but didn't resolve the issue. But instead of finding another solution, like couples counseling or setting clear expectations together, he used his mom as a last resort. While the mom's help is beneficial, the method of introducing it without the wife's consent might have been handled better. The wife's reaction indicates that her feelings were hurt and her autonomy respected.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? Well, he's in a tough spot. But from a relationship standpoint, involving family without the partner's permission can be seen as a breach. The right approach might have been to seek couples counseling or find another way to address the imbalance without third-party intervention. However, the husband's actions were driven by desperation, which complicates things. But in terms of righting or wronging, the act of making a unilateral decision without considering the wife's feelings could be seen as a mistake. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because his intentions were to relieve stress. However, the method was problematic.\n"
