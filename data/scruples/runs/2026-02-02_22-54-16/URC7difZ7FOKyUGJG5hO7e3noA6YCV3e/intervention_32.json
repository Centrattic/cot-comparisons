It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The main issue is about housework and the author inviting their mom to stay without their wife's permission.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they're doing most of the housework, which is causing them stress. The wife isn't helping much, and when asked, she says she's too tired. The author tried to communicate and pleaded, but nothing changed. Then, the mom offered to help and the author brought her in after the wife refused. The wife got upset and there's tension now.\n\nI need to consider fairness. The author is trying to manage work, family, and housework. The wife is not contributing, which is leading to exhaustion. The author's mom stepping in is a form of support. The wife's anger might be about feeling undermined, but the author's intention was to get help when their own requests failed.\n\nBut did the author overstep by bringing in the mom without permission? Maybe the author should have tried more communication first or involved the wife in the decision. However, the situation had been ongoing and the author felt they couldn't handle it anymore. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the stress and lack of support.\n\nOn one hand, involving family without the spouse's consent can be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author was trying to address a problem that wasn't being resolved through discussion. It's a tough balance. The wife might feel disrespected, but the author's well-being is also a factor.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were making a tough choice to address their exhaustion and the imbalance in responsibilities. While the method could have been handled differently, the root issue is the partner not contributing, which is a significant problem. The author's action, though perhaps abrupt, was aimed at resolving a situation that was causing them serious stress.\n"
