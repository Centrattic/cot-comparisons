It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a child. The situation involves the wife not contributing to housework, leading to the husband feeling overwhelmed. He tried talking to his wife, but she didn't help, so he brought in his mom without her consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is working 45 hours a week and doing all the housework, which is a significant load. The wife is taking care of the baby but not helping with other chores. The husband tried to communicate and compromise, but it didn't work. Then he turned to his mom for support, which the wife was upset about.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, inviting someone into the home without the spouse's consent could be seen as overstepping. The wife had a right to be upset because her autonomy in the household decisions was bypassed. However, the husband was clearly at his breaking point, and the mom's help provided necessary relief. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is important. She might feel that the husband didn't fully support her in the parenting role and that he undermined her authority by bringing in his mom. The coldness and possessiveness of the mom might also affect the wife's feelings towards the situation.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The husband tried to communicate his needs but when that failed, he took unilateral action. While his intention was to alleviate his burden, he didn't consider the impact on the wife's feelings and their relationship. Maybe a better approach would have been to revisit the conversation with the wife, seek couples counseling, or find another solution together. \n\nHowever, the husband's actions were driven by genuine need and exhaustion. The wife not contributing to housework is a valid issue, and the husband's stress is understandable. The line between self-care and overstepping is thin here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' perspectives. The husband isn't in the wrong because he was trying to manage his well-being and the household, but he could have handled it more collaboratively. The wife's lack of contribution and the husband's need for support are both factors. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) but with considerations for better communication.\n"
