It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife isn't doing her share of household chores since having a baby, and the author invited his mom to help out without the wife's permission. The wife got upset, so the author is wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife have a child, and the wife is not contributing to housework beyond baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week and is doing all the chores, which is leading to exhaustion. He tried to communicate, but she's not helping. He then brings in his mom without her consent, which causes tension.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. The main issue is the communication breakdown. The author did try to talk to his wife and ask for help, but she doesn't seem to respond. He's exhausted, and the situation isn't improving. Inviting his mom was a last resort after trying to address the problem. However, the key point here is that he didn't discuss it with his wife first and went ahead without her agreement. That could be seen as undermining her autonomy, even if the intention was to find help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom offered to help, which was a good gesture. The wife's refusal might have been due to feeling capable of handling it, but if the author felt it was necessary, maybe there was a lack of understanding. However, the author's approach of inviting the mom without the wife's consent could be problematic because it bypasses her decision-making. It's possible that the wife felt disrespected or that her autonomy was ignored, which could explain her anger.\n\nBut then again, the author wasn't just bringing in help; he was bringing in his mom, who might not have been the best choice if there were underlying issues between the wife and the mother-in-law. However, the author mentioned their relationship is good, so that's a positive. The wife's friend's comment suggests that the action was seen as undermining, which could imply that the author didn't give her a chance to handle it herself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author did try to communicate and didn't get a response, leading to his decision. But not involving the wife in the decision might be where he went wrong. However, given the exhaustion and the lack of progress, his actions were driven by necessity. So, it's a balance between respecting his need for help and respecting his wife's autonomy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's communication was sufficient. He did try, but maybe not enough. The wife might have felt that her needs weren't heard. But if the author felt he couldn't resolve it through discussion, bringing in his mom was a way to address the unmet needs. However, the method of doing so without her consent could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on the cultural context and expectations in their relationship. Some might say the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to manage the household, while others might say he should have found another way instead of bringing in his mom. Given that the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no), I need to decide. The fact that the author didn't discuss it with his wife and went ahead might lean towards A, but his intentions were to get help. So maybe B. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check the summary again. The author tried to communicate, the wife didn't help, he invited his mom after a week. The wife was upset, but the author's mom helped. From an outsider's perspective, it's understandable, but the method might be an issue. I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage his household and his well-being, even if the approach could be improved. So, B.\n"
