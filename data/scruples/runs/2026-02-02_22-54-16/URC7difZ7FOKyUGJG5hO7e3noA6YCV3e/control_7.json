It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their mom move in after their baby was born. The situation is that the wife isn't doing much housework, the author is overwhelmed with work and taking care of everything, and after trying to talk to the wife, they brought in the mom without the wife's permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the wife and he had a pre-existing issue with housework, even before the baby. The split was 65/35, and now with the baby, it's worse. The wife is exhausted from taking care of the baby, so she doesn't contribute. The author tried to communicate but the wife wasn't helping. The mom offered to help, the wife was against it, and the author went ahead anyway.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, bringing in a parent without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining the spouse. The wife was clearly upset, and the friend pointed out that the author undermined her. However, the author was at the breaking point, feeling overburdened. The mom's help did alleviate some stress, which is a positive outcome.\n\nBut from a relationship standpoint, important decisions like having a parent stay should ideally be mutual. The author's actions might be seen as taking control without considering the wife's feelings. However, the wife wasn't open to help, and the author felt they had no choice. It's a tough spot. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the key is communication. The author tried to talk to the wife but didn't get support. The mom's intervention helped, but the method might be questionable. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Need to check again.\n"
