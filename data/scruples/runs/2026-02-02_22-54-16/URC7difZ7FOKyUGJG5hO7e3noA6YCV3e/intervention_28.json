It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife stopped doing housework post-baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The wife used to split housework about 65/35 in favor of the husband, but now she's doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The husband works 45 hours a week and is exhausted, but still does all the housework. He tried to talk to his wife about it, but she says she's too tired. The mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when the husband invites her. The author then brings the mom in anyway, leading to tension.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared responsibilities in a marriage, especially after a baby. The husband feels overburdened and sought help from his mom when his wife isn't contributing. The wife, on the other hand, feels she's already doing her part with the baby. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's working a full-time job and handling all the housework, which is unsustainable. He tried communication, but his wife isn't helping. The mom's help is a temporary solution to prevent burnout. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that she's taking care of the baby, which is also tiring, and she's upset that her husband went behind her back. She might feel that her contributions aren't being recognized, or maybe she's struggling with postpartum issues or other challenges not mentioned here. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for not getting his wife's consent? Well, he did try to communicate and arrange it with his wife, but she refused. When he asked her to change things, she didn't, so he acted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband tried to talk to his wife, but she wasn't cooperative. Sometimes, in stressful situations like postpartum, people might be overwhelmed and not able to handle tasks. Maybe the wife is dealing with something else that isn't visible. \n\nBut the husband is also entitled to his own well-being. If the wife isn't willing to help, and he's at the breaking point, seeking help is reasonable. However, the way he did it\u2014without his wife's approval\u2014could be seen as undermining her. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's presence helped the family function better, and the wife's friend is criticizing the husband for \"undermining\" the wife. But maybe the wife's resistance is part of the problem here. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. He did his part to communicate and tried to resolve the issue. When that failed, taking action to prevent burnout is understandable. However, the method could have been better, maybe involving a mediator or a counselor instead of bringing in his mom without agreement. But given the circumstances, it's a tough spot. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
