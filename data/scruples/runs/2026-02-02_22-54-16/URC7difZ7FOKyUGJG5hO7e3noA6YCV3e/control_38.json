It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby, despite the wife's initial resistance.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The author does most of the housework, around 80%, and his wife does 20%. After the baby, she stops doing housework except for baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and asks for help, but his wife says she's too tired. The author then contacts his mom, who offers to help. He brings her in without his wife's approval, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is the housework division and the author's decision to involve his mom without his wife's consent. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is doing all the work, which is understandable to feel overwhelmed. The wife isn't contributing, and the author's mom steps in. But the author bypassed his wife's wishes. In relationships, communication is key. The author tried to talk to his wife but didn't resolve the issue. Instead of finding a middle ground, he took unilateral action. This could be seen as undermining his wife, especially since she was upset and the friend mentioned it. \n\nHowever, the author was struggling and felt burned out. The mom's help provided necessary relief. The wife's refusal to accept help might stem from pride or stress, but the author's actions were to alleviate his own stress and possibly the baby's well-being. \n\nBut the method of inviting the mom without consent might be the problem. It's important to respect a partner's wishes unless there's an emergency. The author didn't give his wife a chance to reconsider or address the issue together. Instead, he made a decision that affected their household dynamics without mutual agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author's intentions were good, but the approach may have been flawed. The wife's feelings were hurt, and the coldness from the mom towards the baby and possessiveness could add to the tension. The author might have handled it better by involving the wife in the decision, even if he was frustrated. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Possibly. He acted without considering his wife's feelings and their partnership. Relationship issues require collaboration, not unilateral decisions. However, his stress and exhaustion are valid. The answer could be a balance, but based on the question's binary choice, it's likely \"A\" (wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's initial refusal and acted on his own.\n"
