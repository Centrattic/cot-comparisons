It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and new baby without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, the key points in the scenario. The couple had a baby, and the wife isn't contributing to housework. The husband is doing almost all of it, even after a 45-hour workweek. He's exhausted and tried to communicate, but the wife says she's too tired from the baby. The husband confided in his mom, who offered to help. He then invited her without the wife's approval, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether inviting the mom was wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the dynamics here.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's overwhelmed. He's working and managing all household tasks, which is a lot. The wife isn't helping, and communication isn't working. The mom's help is a relief. But the wife feels undermined because the decision was made without her input.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The husband did express his struggles to his wife, but she didn't budge. He tried to compromise, but it didn't work. Inviting his mom might be seen as a last resort. However, not consulting his wife first could be a mistake. Even if the wife wasn't being cooperative, the husband could have tried to negotiate again or involve her in the decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, when the wife refused to let the mom come, and then the husband decided to proceed anyway, that might have been disrespectful. It's important to respect each other's boundaries even when you disagree. The wife's feelings are valid; she might feel that her autonomy in the relationship is being overruled.\n\nBut the husband's perspective is that he's at his breaking point. The question is whether his actions were justified. In many cases, people might see the husband as doing what he needed to take care of his mental health, especially since the wife wasn't willing to compromise. However, the method of inviting his mom without discussing it with her could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIt's a tough spot. The husband likely wasn't in the wrong in terms of needing help, but the way he handled it by not involving his wife in the decision might have been a misstep. So, it's a bit of a gray area. Some might say B (not in the wrong) because he's overburdened and tried everything. Others might say A (in the wrong) because he bypassed his wife's wishes. But given the context of his exhaustion and the lack of cooperation from his wife, I lean towards B. The main issue is the housework split and the wife's refusal to help, which is a bigger problem here. Inviting the mom was a way to seek balance.\n"
