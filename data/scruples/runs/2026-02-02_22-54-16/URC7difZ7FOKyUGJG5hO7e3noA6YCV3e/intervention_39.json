It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new dad who's struggling with housework after having a baby. His wife isn't helping, so he invites his mom to come stay and help without his wife's permission. The wife got angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is doing almost all the housework, even after work. He's tried talking to his wife, who says she's too tired. The mom offers help, but the wife doesn't want that. The man then brings his mom in anyway after a week of no change. \n\nI should think about communication and teamwork in a relationship. When there's a conflict, it's important to address it together. The husband tried asking his wife for help, but when that didn't work, he went to his mom. But maybe he should have tried more communication or counseling instead of bringing in his mom without consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't contributing, and the husband is overwhelmed. The mom's help might be necessary. The wife's reaction could be hurt because her partner went behind her back. \n\nBut bringing in a third party without the spouse's agreement can be seen as undermining them. It might cause more tension. The husband might have valid reasons, but the way he handled it could be problematic. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. Maybe the answer depends on whether the husband made a reasonable effort to resolve the issue together before involving his mom. If he tried everything and it was a last resort, maybe not his fault. But if he didn't communicate properly, maybe he is. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, so I need to consider that perspective too. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. The main issue is the husband's decision to act alone. However, the wife's lack of support might justify his actions. It's a gray area, but maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he was trying to manage the household and his own well-being.\n"
