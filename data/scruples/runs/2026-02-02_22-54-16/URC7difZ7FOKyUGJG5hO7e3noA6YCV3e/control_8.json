It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after their baby was born, despite his wife's objections.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main issue is about household responsibilities. The author and his wife had a baby, and he's been doing most of the housework, even more than before. The wife isn't contributing much outside of baby-related tasks. He tried talking to her, but she says she's too tired. The author then asks his mom for help, and she offers to stay for a couple of weeks. When he brings it up to his wife, she gets angry and says they don't need help. The author then decides to invite his mom without his wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, shared responsibilities, and the author's decision to involve his mom without his wife's consent. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it depends on a few factors. Did the author communicate properly with his wife? He mentioned he tried to ask for help and expressed his exhaustion, but maybe not effectively. The wife might feel that her efforts to care for the baby are being undervalued. The author's decision to invite his mom without consulting her again might have been a breach of trust. Even though he was struggling, the method of bringing in his mom without her wife's agreement could have been disrespectful.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the author is dealing with burnout, and the wife isn't contributing, which is making the situation unsustainable. The mom's help is providing necessary support. The question is whether the author should have found another way to address the issue before involving his mom.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author did try to talk, but maybe not enough. The wife might feel that her needs are being overlooked. The author's action, while understandable from his perspective, could be seen as undermining his wife's autonomy. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because he didn't adequately address the issue through open dialogue and instead took unilateral action. Alternatively, if the wife wasn't willing to compromise, maybe the author had to act to preserve his well-being. But typically, in such cases, the expectation is that both partners work through the problem together, rather than one making a big decision without the other's input.\n"
