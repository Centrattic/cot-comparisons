It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for inviting his mom to stay without his wife's approval. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the husband feels he's doing almost all the housework. His wife isn't helping much, citing exhaustion from taking care of the baby. He talks to his mom, who offers to help. When he brings this up to his wife, she's upset and doesn't want her to come. Despite this, he goes ahead and invites his mom anyway, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband tried to communicate his needs to his wife, but she wasn't responding. He felt overwhelmed and needed support. His mom offered help, which he accepted. But he didn't get his wife's consent first, which might be why the wife felt undermined.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. The husband did mention the problem to his wife and asked for help, but she didn't want to change. When he suggested his mom's help, she was against it. By going ahead without her consent, he might have breached trust, even if his intentions were good. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly stressed and the wife isn't contributing, which can be common after having a baby. New parents often struggle with balancing responsibilities. The husband's decision could be seen as a last resort to manage the situation, especially if he felt his wife wasn't willing to share the load despite his requests.\n\nBut the problem is that he didn't respect his wife's initial refusal when he invited his mom. Even if he was burnt out, there might be a better way to handle it, like couples counseling or finding another compromise. Inviting his mom without her consent could be seen as disregarding her feelings and autonomy, which might make the situation worse.\n\nSo, while the husband's actions were driven by his need for support, the way he handled it\u2014ignoring his wife's wishes\u2014might be where he went wrong. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt her autonomy wasn't respected. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, the question is whether he's at fault, and the act of making a decision without mutual agreement is a key factor.\n"
