It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new father who's dealing with a lot of housework because his wife isn't helping, and he invited his mom to stay without his wife's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband mentions that before the baby, the housework split was already skewed towards him (65/35). After the baby, the wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He's working 45 hours a week and comes home to do all the chores. He's tried communicating, but she says she's too tired. Then his mom offers to help, but the wife refuses. The husband, feeling overwhelmed, invites his mom anyway when the wife doesn't change her behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for inviting his mom without his wife's permission. On one hand, he's clearly struggling and has made efforts to communicate. The wife isn't contributing, which is leading to his burnout. On the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected or undermined by him bringing in his mom without her approval. The wife's friend points out that he undermined her, which suggests that the husband's actions might have hurt their relationship.\n\nBut the key points are: Did he give his wife enough chances to change? Did he communicate effectively? The husband says he tried asking and pleading, but she didn't help. Then he waited a week, and things were the same. Inviting his mom was a last resort to get some relief. However, bypassing his wife's wishes could be seen as a breach of trust or respect, even if his intentions were good.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to manage his own well-being and the household, which is important. But the way he did it might not have considered his wife's feelings. Maybe a better approach would have been to seek couples counseling or find another solution together. But given the circumstances, he was at his breaking point. \n\nAlso, the wife's coldness and possessiveness towards the baby might be an issue, but that's on her side. The husband's action might have been a necessary step to avoid burnout. However, in a relationship, decisions that affect both partners should ideally be mutual. So, there's a case to be made that he overstepped by not getting consent. But there's also a case that he was trying to save the family dynamic by preventing his own breakdown.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural or personal values. In some cultures, involving family is normal. But in terms of partner autonomy, it's a problem. However, given the context of extreme stress and lack of support, the husband's action is understandable. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, and the analysis seems to support that. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
