It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having their mom stay with their family after having a baby. The situation is that the author's wife isn't doing her share of housework, and he's overwhelmed. He tried talking to her, but she's not helping, so he brings in his mom without her permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working 45 hours a week and doing most of the housework since the baby was born. His wife is taking care of the baby during the day but isn't contributing to chores. He tried communicating, but she's not listening. He felt so overwhelmed that he decided to involve his mom, which made his wife upset. \n\nNow, the question is whether he did the right thing. On one hand, the author is seeking help because he's struggling. He's not the one taking care of the baby 24/7; the wife is handling the baby during the day. But when he gets home, he's expected to do all the chores. The wife's response is that she's too tired, which might be valid, but she's not contributing at all. He's been trying to work things out, but when that fails, he brings in his mom. \n\nIs it wrong to bring in help without the spouse's consent? Well, the author's intention was to take care of himself and the baby, not to undermine his wife. He did mention his plan to invite his mom after a week of no change, which shows he gave her a chance. However, by inviting his mom without her permission, he might have acted unilaterally, which could be seen as disrespectful to his wife's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mental health and the well-being of the family are important. If the wife isn't contributing and he's burning out, getting help is necessary. The wife's anger might stem from feeling criticized or untrusted. The author's mom's presence is helping alleviate the stress, which is positive. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author wronged his wife by not discussing this more. Maybe he should have found a middle ground, like talking to his wife again before bringing in his mom. However, he did give her a week to change after their conversation. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a tough call. The author's actions were to address his own and the baby's needs, which is understandable. But the method of bringing in help without consent could have been handled better. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I'd lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to solve a problem that was affecting the entire family's well-being, even if the approach was a bit abrupt.\n"
