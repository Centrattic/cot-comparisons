It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework after having a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He's been doing most of the housework, even after work, while the wife seems to do very little. He tried to communicate his exhaustion, but she responds that she's also tired from taking care of the baby. The mom offers to help, and the author invites her over without the wife's consent when the wife refuses the help. The wife gets angry and the author feels justified because he's overwhelmed.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Did the author act in a way that's justifiable given the circumstances? The wife isn't helping, leading to the author being overworked. The mom's help is a relief. But the wife feels undermined by the author making the decision without her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to talk to his wife, but she didn't respond positively. Inviting a parent without the spouse's permission might be seen as overstepping, but the author was at the breaking point. However, the wife's feelings are also valid. She might feel that her partner didn't respect her autonomy by involving his mom without her consent. \n\nThe author's motivation is to get help and reduce his workload, which is understandable. But the method\u2014inviting a parent without the spouse's okay\u2014could be seen as a poor communication choice. The wife's friend's comment suggests that others might perceive it as undermining her. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't contributing to household tasks, leading to the author's burnout. The mom's help is providing necessary support. The author's actions might be seen as self-care and prioritizing the family's well-being by ensuring the parents can manage. \n\nBut where's the line between necessary support and overstepping? The author's approach might not be the best, but the situation shows a lack of resolution from the wife's side. The author's actions could be seen as trying to maintain the family's stability. \n\nIn many similar cases, the expectation is that both parents share responsibilities. If one is refusing, the other might seek help. However, involving a parent without discussion can cause tension. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to address a problem that's been ignored. Alternatively, he could be at fault for not finding another solution first or not communicating better with his wife. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions stem from a place of needing support and trying to balance work, family, and self-care. The wife's refusal to engage in the housework is a significant issue. The author's decision, while perhaps not the most ideal, is a response to a stressful situation where previous attempts at resolution failed. Therefore, he's likely not in the wrong.\n"
