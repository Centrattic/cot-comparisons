It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who sought advice (AITA) is in the wrong for allowing his mom to come stay after their first child was born. The main issue is the division of household chores and childcare between the couple.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions that his wife has been doing minimal housework, especially since the baby was born. He works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted, doing all the chores and taking care of the baby. He tried to communicate his struggles, but the wife responds that she's too tired from caring for the baby. The husband then involves his mom to help out, which the wife is upset about because she didn't want help. The husband arranged it anyway after a week of no change.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband did try to address the issue with his wife first. He asked for help, expressed his exhaustion, but she didn't respond. When his mom offered to help, he checked with his wife, who refused. But since the situation didn't improve, he brought his mom in without her consent. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is taking initiative to manage the household and his well-being, which is understandable given the stress. On the other, involving a third party without the wife's agreement could be seen as undermining her. However, he did try to communicate and got no cooperation. The wife's behavior might be contributing to the problem, but the husband's actions were to alleviate his own burnout and maybe to help the baby's care indirectly.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't being inconsiderate of his wife's feelings, but he's also taking steps to protect his mental health and the functioning of the household. The wife's anger might be due to feeling disrespected, but the husband's actions could be justified if he felt he had no other choice. The key point is whether he crossed a line by not respecting her wishes after she explicitly refused help. However, since he had already tried to address the issue and there was no resolution, his decision to bring in his mom might be seen as a necessary step to maintain his well-being and the family's stability. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because he made efforts to communicate and only acted after those efforts failed. The wife's refusal to help under any circumstances is a significant factor here.\n"
