It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after his wife isn't helping with housework. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple had a baby four months ago. The husband has been doing most of the housework, even after work. The wife is taking care of the baby during the day and is too exhausted to help, even after being asked. The husband's mom offers to come and help, but the wife is upset when he invites her. The husband then proceeds anyway after a week of no change, leading to tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The husband did talk to his wife about the housework and she wasn't helping. He tried to express his exhaustion. The problem is that when he invited his mom, he did so without the wife's consent, even after she was upset. That could be seen as disrespectful. However, the wife isn't contributing at all, leading to the husband's burnout. \n\nOn one hand, the husband acted out of necessity to manage his stress and workload. On the other hand, he didn't respect his wife's wishes by bringing in his mom without her agreement. The wife's reaction might be because she feels disrespected or undermined. But the husband's actions might be justified if he's on the verge of breaking down. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether he should have found a better solution, like more communication or compromise, rather than bringing in his mom without her consent. However, given the wife's lack of contribution, maybe the husband had no choice. It's a tricky balance. \n\nThe wife's friend's comment about undermining her suggests that the husband's approach could be seen as dismissive. But the husband's perspective is that he's overwhelmed. It's a situation where both parties might have valid points, but the husband's unilateral decision could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband didn't do anything illegal, but relationship-wise, involving a parent in this way without the spouse's consent could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the underlying issue of unequal housework is also a significant problem. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because he was addressing a legitimate need, but he could have handled it more collaboratively. However, given the options, the answer would be B (No), as he had a valid reason and the wife wasn't contributing.\n"
