It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife after having a baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby, and the husband has been doing most of the housework, even after work. The wife isn't contributing, saying she's too tired from the baby. He tried to communicate, but she didn't help. He then asked his mom to come help, which the wife was upset about. He went ahead anyway when things didn't improve, leading to conflict.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's overwhelmed, working 45 hours, doing all the housework, and the wife isn't contributing. He tried to communicate but to no avail. Inviting his mom was a last resort to manage the stress. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her effort in taking care of the baby is valid, and the husband's decision to involve his mom without her consent could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nCultural factors might play a role. In some cultures, involving a parent for help is common and expected. The husband did mention the mom's offer, and the wife was against it. However, the husband felt it was necessary for his well-being. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The husband did try to discuss it with his wife but when she refused, he took action. While it's important to respect a spouse's wishes, there's also the aspect of personal well-being and the health of the marriage. If the wife isn't contributing in any way and the husband is burnt out, maybe his actions were justified. However, the method of inviting his mom without her consent could be seen as undermining her. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014postpartum stress, lack of support, and the wife not helping\u2014it's possible that the husband wasn't in the wrong. He took steps to address a problem that wasn't being resolved through communication. The wife's reaction might be part of postpartum stress as well, but the husband's need to seek help is valid.\n\nSo, weighing the exhaustion, the attempts to communicate, and the necessity for external help, the husband's actions seem reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
