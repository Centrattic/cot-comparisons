It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author inviting his mom to stay with them after their baby was born because his wife wasn't helping with housework. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that before the baby, the housework split was already uneven, around 65/35 or 80/20 in his favor. After the baby, the wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week and is exhausted when he comes home. He tried asking for help but the wife says she's too tired. The author then confides in his mom, who offers to help. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and refuses, so he invites his mom anyway after a week without change.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should look at both sides. The author is clearly overwhelmed and trying to manage work, parenting, and all the housework. The wife isn't contributing, which is a common issue in parenting. The author tried communication and it didn't work. Inviting his mom might be seen as a last resort to prevent burnout. However, the wife's feelings were hurt because her partner didn't consult her properly. The author did mention he told his wife first, but she refused help. The mom's arrival also caused tension, with the wife being cold and possessive towards the baby.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author needed help and the wife wasn't providing any. Inviting a family member to assist when the partner is unwilling could be justified. However, the method of doing so without the wife's consent after she refused might come off as disrespectful. The wife might feel undermined, which is why her friend mentioned it. But the author was at the breaking point.\n\nI think the key points are the communication attempts, the wife's refusal, and the author's state of exhaustion. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking help when his own partner isn't able or willing to do it. The wife's lack of contribution is a problem, and the author had to take action to maintain his well-being and the family's stability. The friend's comment is valid, but the core issue is the wife's lack of support. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
