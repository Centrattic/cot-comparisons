It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after their baby was born, despite the wife's objections. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a child four months ago. They're both exhausted. The author mentions that even before the baby, the housework was split unevenly, with him doing 65-80% of it. Now, with the baby, the wife is doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home tired, and ends up doing all the housework. He's tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author feels overwhelmed and decides to bring in his mom for help after the wife refuses. His mom helps out, which the author is grateful for, but the wife is upset and the mom is cold and possessive towards the baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The author tried to communicate his needs to his wife but felt ignored. He sought support from his mom because he felt he couldn't handle it alone. However, he did this without the wife's consent, which caused conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking action to address his stress and the imbalance in responsibilities. He's in a tough spot, working and doing all the housework, which is understandable. On the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected or undermined by having her mother-in-law involved without her agreement. The wife might also feel that her situation isn't being acknowledged, maybe she's also struggling in ways the author isn't seeing, like postpartum depression or other stressors that make it hard for her to contribute. \n\nIt's important to note that the author didn't consult his wife before bringing his mom in, which is a breach of communication. Even if he felt desperate, involving a third party without mutual consent can strain relationships. The wife's reaction indicates that she values the partnership and might feel that her autonomy in the decision-making process was ignored. \n\nHowever, the author's actions were also a response to a lack of support and an unbalanced situation. He might not have felt he had another option, especially if his wife wasn't contributing. The key here is whether the author's approach was respectful or not. Inviting his mom without the wife's permission could be seen as disrespectful to the wife's wishes, even if the intention was good. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's well-being and the baby's needs. If he's burning out, that could affect the entire family. Maybe the author should have explored other options first, like couples counseling or external help, rather than bringing in his mom. However, in the moment, he chose the solution he thought would work best for him, even if it caused conflict.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author's actions were in response to a stressful situation, but the method of involving his mom without his wife's consent might have been a mistake. The wife's feelings and the existing dynamics with the mother-in-law could have been harmed. Therefore, while the author's intentions were to alleviate his burden, the way he did it might have been inconsiderate of his wife's perspective and boundaries. That suggests that he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n"
