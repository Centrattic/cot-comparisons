It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby, despite the wife's initial refusal.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a new parent couple dealing with household responsibilities. The husband feels he's doing most of the housework, and the wife is overwhelmed with the baby. The mom offers help, but the wife is against it. The husband invites the mom anyway when things don't improve.\n\nHmm. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage work, housework, and baby care. He's exhausted and communicates his needs. The wife isn't helping, so he seeks external help. He tried talking to her, but she's not responding. Inviting his mom is a way to get support, but he did it without the wife's approval, which upset her.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel her autonomy is being undermined. She might feel her partner isn't respecting her decisions or her parenting choices. The husband's action could be seen as overstepping, even if his intentions were good.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he tried to address the problem by communication. When that didn't work, he took action to alleviate his stress, which is understandable. However, not consulting with his wife further and going ahead might have been a mistake. Maybe a better approach would have been to seek mediation or find another solution together.\n\nBut considering the burnout and lack of support from the wife, his decision might be justified. It's a tough situation. The mom's help provided relief, but it caused marital tension. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The husband did communicate his struggles, but maybe not enough to find a compromise. Still, the immediate action to involve his mom, while necessary for him, could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), but there's nuance. The husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's dealing with a heavy load and tried to find a solution. The wife's feelings are valid too, but the situation is complex. The main issue is the lack of consensus, not necessarily the action itself.\n"
