It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after their baby was born. The main issue is housework distribution between the husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions that he does about 80% of the housework, which he's okay with when it's just the two of them. But after the baby, the wife stopped doing even the baby-related tasks. He's working 45 hours and coming home to do all the chores. He tried talking to her, but she won't help, saying she's too tired. \n\nHe then confided in his mom, who offered to help. When he suggested it to his wife, she got angry and said they can handle it. He waited a week, things didn't improve, so he invited his mom without permission. The wife was upset, and the mom's presence has been helpful for him but made the wife feel undermined.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. He's clearly overwhelmed, and communication failed. He tried negotiating, but she wasn't budging. Bringing in his mom was a last resort. On one hand, he should have discussed it more thoroughly and maybe found another solution. But on the other hand, he was at his breaking point and felt it was necessary. The wife's friend criticized him, but the user is asking for an opinion. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and find solutions together. However, sometimes one partner may feel they have no other choice. The husband's action might be seen as overstepping since he didn't get consent, but the context of his stress and the wife's refusal to help complicates things. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. Depending on cultural norms and relationship expectations, the answer might vary. But generally, the husband's intention was to seek help for his well-being and the family's good, though the method was abrupt. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
