It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for bringing their mom to stay with them after having a child. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author and his wife had a baby. He mentions that housework has been a problem even before the baby, with him doing most of it. Now, since the baby was born, his wife is doing even less, and he's taking care of everything else. He tried asking her for help but she said she was too tired. He then told his mom, who offered to help, and he invited her over without his wife's approval. His wife was upset, and the mom ended up being helpful.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by bringing in his mom without his wife's consent. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author is feeling overwhelmed. He's working 45 hours a week, which is manageable, but after work, he's doing all the housework and taking care of the baby. His wife isn't contributing, and even when he asks, she's not willing to help. He's tried communicating, which is important. Then, he reaches out to his mom, who's willing to help, and he brings her in without his wife's permission. The wife is upset because she felt undermined.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate his struggles to his wife and tried to work it out. When that didn't work, he sought external help from his mom. But he didn't check with his wife first. That's where the conflict arises. Is it okay to bring in family without the partner's consent if you're at your breaking point?\n\nOn one hand, the author is doing what he feels is necessary to maintain his well-being and the household. On the other hand, his wife might feel that her autonomy is being respected. She might want to handle things on her own, even if she's not contributing equally. However, the author's argument is that he's already doing everything, and the situation is unsustainable.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to solve a problem that's causing stress. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like involving a mediator or discussing it more thoroughly with his wife before bringing in his mom. However, given the circumstances and the fact that he tried to communicate, maybe he's not at fault. The answer might depend on cultural norms too, where extended family often helps out. But in this case, since the wife was already upset, bringing in the mom without her okay might be seen as overstepping. Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's addressing a real issue that's affecting their life.\n"
