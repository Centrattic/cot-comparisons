It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with them after having a child. The situation is that the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks, and the husband feels overwhelmed. He tried talking to her, but she's not helping. Then he brings in his mom without the wife's consent, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is clearly overworked, doing most of the housework and taking care of the baby after work. The wife isn't contributing, which is causing stress. The husband's mom offers help, but the wife doesn't want her there. The husband invites her anyway after a week of no improvement.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the husband is trying to manage the household and his own well-being. On the other hand, he didn't communicate effectively with his wife before making the decision. He might have assumed that his mom's help was the only solution without exploring other options like couples counseling or working out a better division of labor.\n\nThe wife's reaction is anger and feeling undermined, which is a valid emotional response. Bringing in a parent without consent can create tension and might be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's approach was confrontational by saying he would invite the mom with or without her permission, which could have been handled more collaboratively.\n\nHowever, the husband's stress is real. The wife isn't contributing, leading to burnout. The mother's help does provide relief, which is positive. But the method of introducing that help might have been poor. The key issue here is communication. The husband should have tried to resolve the housework division issue with his wife first, perhaps through therapy or more open dialogue, before bringing in his mom. By not addressing the root problem and taking unilateral action, he may have acted out of frustration without considering the relational impact.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The husband's intentions were to alleviate his burden, but the approach might have been flawed. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation collaboratively, leading to conflict. However, some might argue that his actions were necessary to prevent burnout. But given the emphasis on communication and mutual agreement in relationships, the husband's unilateral decision could be seen as a mistake.\n"
