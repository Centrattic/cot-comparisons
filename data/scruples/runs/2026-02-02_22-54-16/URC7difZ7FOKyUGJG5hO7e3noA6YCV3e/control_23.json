It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and he's doing almost all the housework. The wife isn't helping much, and he's exhausted from work and the chores. He told his mom, who offered to come stay and help. The author then invited his mom without his wife's consent, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking on a lot of responsibility, both at work and at home, which is leading to burnout. The wife is supposed to be sharing the load, but she's not contributing, even when asked. The author tried to communicate his feelings and asked for help, but the wife responded that she's too tired. The author then sought help from his mom without consulting his wife, which caused conflict.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for inviting his mom? Well, he did communicate his issues to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. His mom offered to help, and he felt that having her there would alleviate the stress. However, inviting her without the wife's consent might have been a misstep because it could make the wife feel disrespected or undermined. The wife was already upset, and the author's decision to proceed without her input might have been seen as taking sides against her, even if the intention was to get help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was at the point of burnout and felt he had no choice. The mom's help was beneficial, allowing the author to rest and even spend time with friends. The wife's friend pointed out that the author undermined his wife, which suggests that the method of inviting the mom without discussion might have been a problem. But the root issue is the unequal division of labor in the marriage.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to address a problem that's been persistent and affecting their relationship. However, maybe the approach could have been better, like involving the wife more in the decision or seeking couples counseling. But given the circumstances, the author's actions were a response to being overburdened, which isn't his fault. The wife's lack of contribution is the main issue here. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
