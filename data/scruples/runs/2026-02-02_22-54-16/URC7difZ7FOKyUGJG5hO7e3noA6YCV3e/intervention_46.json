It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and they're dealing with a lot of stress and unequal division of chores. The author is doing most of the housework, which is leading to burnout. He asked his mom to come help, but his wife was upset about it. The author then brought his mom without his wife's permission, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working 45 hours a week, which isn't too bad, but after work, he's doing all the housework and taking care of the baby. The wife is handling the baby-related tasks but nothing else. The author has tried to communicate his exhaustion and asked for help, but the wife isn't contributing. He feels that bringing his mom in is a solution to alleviate the stress.\n\nThe key points are communication and consent. The author did express his struggles to his wife, but she refused help. He then decided to bring in his mom despite her objections. The question is whether this action was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to manage the household and his own well-being, which is important. Parents often need support, especially when adjusting to a new baby. The mom stepping in to help is a common solution in many families. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't get his wife's permission. This could be seen as undermining her, especially if she felt that bringing in family without her consent was disrespectful. The wife's reaction of being upset and yelling suggests that her feelings were hurt. The friend's comment also implies that the action might have been seen as disrespectful to the wife.\n\nBut the author's actions were driven by his own exhaustion and the feeling that his wife wasn't contributing. He did try to communicate, but the wife wasn't responsive. When he set a boundary (inviting the mom if things didn't change), the wife's side of the conversation might not have considered the author's well-being enough. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that he tried to communicate and set boundaries, and the wife wasn't listening, then inviting his mom could be a reasonable step to protect his health. However, the method of doing it without her consent might have been handled better. Perhaps a middle ground could have been found, like involving counseling or another mediator. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the author's priority was his own well-being and the household's stability. The wife's refusal to help despite the author's communication might mean that the author's actions were justified. The fact that his mom's help has been beneficial for the family overall (they could go out, he's less stressed) might support the idea that he wasn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's a close call. The main issue is the lack of consent, but the underlying problem of unequal household responsibilities and the author's need for support might make his actions understandable.\n"
