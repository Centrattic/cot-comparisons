It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a couple with a newborn, where the husband feels overwhelmed with housework because the wife isn't contributing, and he invites his mom to help without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband works 45 hours a week, does most of the housework, and the wife stopped doing any chores after the baby was born. He's exhausted and tried talking to her, but she doesn't help. Then the mom offers to come in and help, but the wife refuses. The husband proceeds to invite his mom anyway, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The husband's main issue is the imbalance in chores. He's trying to manage work, parenting, and household duties alone. He communicated his need for help, but the wife wasn't cooperating. Inviting the mom was his way of addressing the problem when other methods failed. However, he did it without the wife's consent, which could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is that she's handling the baby all day and is too tired to help. She might feel that the husband isn't sharing the parenting responsibilities equally, or that the mom's presence is intrusive. The wife's anger could stem from feeling undermined or not being given a chance to improve the situation.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband did try to talk to his wife, but maybe not enough. But after repeated refusal and the situation not improving, he took action. The question is, was that action justified? Some might say yes, because he was at his breaking point. Others might say no, because he should have found another way to resolve it without involving family without consent.\n\nThe friend's comment suggests that undermining the wife is bad, but the husband argues it's between them. The wife's coldness and possessiveness toward the baby might complicate things. The husband's intention was to get help, but the method was questionable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's in a stressful situation but bypassing the wife's wishes could be seen as wrong. However, if the wife wasn't responsive to communication and he was genuinely overwhelmed, maybe it's understandable. The answer depends on whether the means justified the ends. If the husband had tried all other avenues and failed, maybe it's not his fault. But if he didn't give the wife enough time or support, then maybe he is in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all angles, I think the answer is B, not in the wrong. He was trying to solve a problem he felt was unmanageable, and the wife's refusal to help led him to take that step. Communication issues might exist, but the core issue is the imbalance in responsibilities.\n"
