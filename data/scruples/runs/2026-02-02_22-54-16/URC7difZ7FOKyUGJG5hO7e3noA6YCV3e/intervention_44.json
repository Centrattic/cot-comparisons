It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after having a baby because the wife isn't doing any housework, leading to the author being overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that before the baby, the wife contributed about 35% to housework, which is already a bit uneven. After the baby, she's doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. The author works full-time and comes home exhausted, expecting some help, but the wife says she's too tired. He tried to communicate his needs, but she didn't respond, so he invited his mom without her permission. The wife got upset and the friend criticized him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to manage a household with a newborn, which is extremely stressful. The wife isn't pulling her weight, and he's exhausted. Inviting his mom could be seen as a reasonable solution to get some help and reduce his stress. It's for the benefit of the family, not just himself. The mom's presence helps both the author and the wife, even if the wife is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her autonomy in managing the household is being undermined. Inviting his mom without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting her wishes. However, the author did mention the situation to her and she refused the help, so he's taking matters into his own hands because he's at his breaking point.\n\nI think the key points here are the communication issues and the level of stress. The author tried to talk to his wife and didn't get any support. The mom's help is temporary, and the author's actions are meant to improve the situation for everyone. While the wife's feelings are valid, the author is also entitled to seek solutions when he's overwhelmed. It's a tough situation, but I don't think he's in the wrong here. He's trying to address a problem that's affecting their family life.\n"
