It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with them after their first child. \n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the division of household chores. The author mentions that their wife hasn't been helping with housework since the baby was born, leading to him being overwhelmed. His work hours are 45 a week, which he says isn't too bad, but he's still exhausted after work from doing all the chores and taking care of the baby. The wife responds to his requests for help by saying she's too tired from taking care of the baby. \n\nThe author then confides in his mom, who offers to come stay to help. When he tells his wife, she's angry and insists they can handle it themselves. The author then decides to invite the mom anyway after a week of no change, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author overstepped by bringing in his mom without his wife's consent. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author tried talking to his wife multiple times, but she wasn't responding. He might have felt that he was at his breaking point and needed immediate help. However, bringing in a parent without the spouse's consent can be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy in the marriage. \n\nOn one hand, the author's stress is valid; parenting is hard, and housework adds to the burden. The wife's lack of contribution is a problem, and the author is trying to manage the situation. On the other hand, involving his mom without his wife's agreement could be seen as undermining her and not respecting her wishes. \n\nBut wait, the wife was already upset when he told her, and he gave her a week to change things. If she didn't change her behavior, maybe the author felt he had no choice. However, in most relationships, major decisions like having a parent move in should be mutual. By going ahead anyway, the author might have hurt his wife's feelings and possibly damaged their trust. \n\nThe wife's friend's comment about undermining her suggests that the action might have been perceived as disrespectful. The key here is whether the author's actions were a necessary step to protect his well-being or if he breached the relationship's boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's stress is real, and the wife's inaction is a problem. But the method of resolution (bringing in mom without agreement) could be seen as wrong because it didn't respect the wife's autonomy. The author should have maybe sought other solutions first, like couples counseling, before taking that step. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't find a way to resolve the issue together, even if the wife's behavior was contributing to the problem. Relationships require mutual problem-solving, and involving a third party without consent can be a breach of that trust.\n"
