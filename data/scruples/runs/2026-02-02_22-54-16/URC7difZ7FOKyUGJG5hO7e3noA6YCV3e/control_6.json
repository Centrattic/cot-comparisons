It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for allowing their mom to come stay with them after their wife refused. So first, the situation: they have a newborn, the wife isn't helping with chores except baby-related tasks. The husband is doing most of the work, even after a long workday. He talks to his mom, who offers to help, but the wife gets angry when he tells her. He then goes ahead anyway after a week of no change.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the imbalance in household responsibilities. The husband feels overwhelmed and tries to communicate his needs. The wife is also exhausted, maybe from caring for the baby. He tried asking her for help but she didn't contribute. Then, when he brings in his mom, the wife is upset.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he did try to resolve the issue by discussing it with his wife first. He mentioned the problem, tried to get her help, and when that didn't work, he sought external help. But he didn't get her consent for the mom to come, which might be a point of contention. However, he was considering his own well-being and the baby's care, which are valid concerns.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable because she might feel disrespected or undermined. But the husband's actions were to address his own burnout and ensure the baby was being cared for properly. The mom's help actually allowed them to have some time to rest and even go out, which could be positive. \n\nSo, the key points are communication and consent. The husband didn't get his wife's permission, which could be a mistake. But given the circumstances, he was trying to solve a problem that they couldn't resolve themselves. The question is whether not getting permission makes him wrong. On one hand, he should have discussed more and maybe found another solution. On the other hand, his actions did help alleviate the situation. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't entirely wrong because he was trying to manage the household and his stress, but he could have handled the communication better. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations as well. However, the user is asking for a binary choice. Considering that he tried to address the issue and the help provided was beneficial, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the lack of consent is a point against him. Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because the intent was to help and the outcome was positive, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
