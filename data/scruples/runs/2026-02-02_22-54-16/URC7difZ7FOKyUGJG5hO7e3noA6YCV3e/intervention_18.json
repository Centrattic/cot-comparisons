It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for allowing their mom to come stay with them after having a baby. The situation involves the author, their wife, and the dynamics of household responsibilities post-childbirth.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they and their wife had a child four months ago. The main issue is the division of housework, which was already a problem before the baby. The author claims they do 80% of the housework, and after the baby, the wife does almost none, focusing only on baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and tries to help with the baby so the wife can rest, but ends up doing all the housework. They've tried to communicate this to their wife, who responds that she's too tired from taking care of the baby.\n\nThen, the author's mom, who lives across the country, offers to help by staying with them for a couple of weeks. The author is grateful and arranges it, but when he tells his wife, she's angry and refuses the help. The author then decides to bring his mom anyway after a week of things not improving, leading to conflict where the wife is upset, and the mom becomes cold and possessive of the baby. The wife's friend also criticizes the author for undermining his wife.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author tried to communicate their stress and exhaustion to the wife, who wasn't responsive. The author's mom offered help, which was a good gesture. The author arranged the visit without the wife's consent after the wife refused help. The wife felt undermined, and the author's mom's behavior became problematic (cold, possessive). However, the author's main issue was the lack of shared responsibilities leading to burnout.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's perspective is that they were overwhelmed and needed support. The wife's perspective is that she didn't want help and felt her autonomy was disrespected. The author might have overstepped by arranging the visit without his wife's consent, but the underlying problem is the unequal distribution of labor. Cultural factors might also play a role here, as in some cultures, seeking help from family is common.\n\nThe author's mom's behavior post-arrival complicates things. If the mom became possessive, that's an issue. But the initial decision to bring her in might have been a last resort after repeated attempts to address the problem. The author's actions could be seen as necessary for their well-being, but the method might have been poor communication. However, since the wife wasn't responsive to discussions, the author felt compelled to act independently.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person made a reasonable effort to resolve the issue before taking drastic steps. The author did try to talk, and the wife refused. Bringing in family help is a common solution in such situations. The conflict arises because the author acted without consent, but the wife's refusal to engage in problem-solving might be the root issue. The author's mom's behavior might not reflect the author's intentions, but the author is responsible for that too.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe they could have involved a mediator or sought couples counseling instead of bringing in their mom without the wife's consent. However, given the stress and exhaustion, the author's actions might be understandable. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to an untenable situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method of bringing in their mom without the wife's consent could be seen as overstepping, the underlying issue of unequal household responsibilities and the author's burnout are significant factors. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, especially if they tried to communicate and the wife was not cooperative. The answer might lean towards B (no), but with the caveat that communication could have been better. The author's mom's behavior complicates things, but the primary issue is the housework split and the author's need for support.\n"
