It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having their mom stay with them after their baby was born because their wife isn't doing the housework.\n\nSo the situation is: the couple had a baby, the husband works 45 hours a week, comes home to do all the housework because the wife is either too tired or not doing it. They tried talking, but the wife isn't helping. The husband then brings in his mom without the wife's consent to help out. The wife gets angry and feels undermined, and some friends are commenting on it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is clearly overwhelmed, and the division of labor is a common issue in many households. He's tried communicating, but it hasn't worked. He felt he had no choice but to bring in his mom. On the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected or that her feelings were ignored when the mom was brought in without her consent.\n\nIs the husband wrong for doing that? Well, he did express his concerns first. He tried to talk to his wife and didn't get the help he needed. He even gave a warning that if nothing changed, he'd bring in his mom. Then he followed through. But he did go against his wife's wishes. In relationships, mutual respect is important. Maybe he should have found another way before involving his mom. But on the flip side, he's the one doing all the work and the mom's help is providing relief. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. She might feel that her needs or perspective weren't considered, especially if she thought they could handle it. However, the husband's actions were driven by his own exhaustion and the lack of support.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The husband acted out of necessity, but he did it without considering his wife's feelings. Some might argue that he should have found a different solution or tried even harder to communicate. Others might see it as a valid step to take when things are unsustainable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because the situation was overwhelming. But he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or the couple's specific agreements. But given the information, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with the note that there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
