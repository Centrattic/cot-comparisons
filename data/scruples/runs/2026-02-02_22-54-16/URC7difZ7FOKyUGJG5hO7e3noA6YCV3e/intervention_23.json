It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He mentions that the main issue they've had is housework, with him doing 65-80% of it. After the baby, the wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, but still does all the housework. He's tried asking for help, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. He then confides in his mom, who offers to come stay for a couple of weeks to help. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and says they can handle it themselves. After a week of no change, he invites his mom anyway without her permission. The mom arrives, takes over the baby care, and the wife is upset. The author is now being criticized by his wife's friend for undermining her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the housework division. 65-80% is a significant imbalance. The wife is doing very little, even after the author expresses his exhaustion. He's tried asking for help, but she's resistant. Maybe she's stressed or overwhelmed with the baby, but the author is also struggling. \n\nThen, the author's mom offers help. The wife initially refuses, but the author proceeds anyway after a week. Is this okay? Well, the author feels he's at his breaking point. But did he communicate effectively? Did he try to resolve the issue before bringing in his mom?\n\nHe said he tried to ask his wife for help and explained his exhaustion. She responds by saying she's too tired. Maybe there's a misunderstanding or differing perceptions of what constitutes helpful tasks. The author might need to address this more collaboratively instead of unilaterally deciding to bring in his mom. However, his mom's help is a valid solution to prevent burnout, especially if communication isn't working.\n\nBut the wife felt undermined because he invited his mom without her consent. That's a relationship issue. Even if the housework is an issue, involving his mom without discussing it fully with his wife might have been a misstep. The friend points out that the wife is upset, so the author might have overlooked his wife's feelings in his own stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is doing all the work, which is unsustainable. The mom's help provides relief, which is necessary. The wife's refusal to accept help might be due to pride or feeling incapable, but the author's action was to prevent himself from being overwhelmed.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He had valid reasons for inviting his mom, but not discussing it adequately with his wife might have caused hurt feelings. The key is whether he considered his wife's perspective and tried to find a mutual solution before taking unilateral action. If he had tried to work it out with her first, maybe without involving his mom, that would be better. But given the circumstances, his actions were to address his own well-being. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's in a stressful situation and the mom's help is beneficial, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's acting to resolve his own burnout and the wife's behavior isn't improving, it's a bit of a gray area. But since he went against his wife's wishes without addressing the underlying issue together, maybe it's a partial wrong. But I think the main problem is the wife's lack of contribution, not the author's decision to get help. So I'll go with B.\n"
