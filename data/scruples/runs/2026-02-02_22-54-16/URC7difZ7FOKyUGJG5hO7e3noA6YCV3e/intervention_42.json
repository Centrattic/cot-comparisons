It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them without their wife's permission. \n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a baby, and he's doing most of the housework, which was already a problem before the baby. Now, with the baby, the wife does almost none. The author is working 45 hours and still ends up doing all the chores. He talks to his mom about it, and she offers to help for a couple of weeks. When he brings it up to his wife, she's angry and refuses. The author then goes ahead and invites his mom anyway after a week of no change. \n\nSo, the main conflict here is about household responsibilities and the author's decision to bring in external help. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The wife isn't contributing, and the author is overwhelmed. He tried communicating, but it didn't work. Bringing in his mom was a solution to alleviate his stress. However, not consulting his wife further might have caused her to feel disrespected. \n\nBut in a marriage, the couple should work together. The author's approach might have been a bit abrupt. Instead of doing it without permission, maybe setting clearer boundaries or seeking counseling first could have been a better step. However, the situation was affecting his well-being. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a balance between self-care and mutual respect. He had valid reasons for being overwhelmed, but the method might have been poor communication. So, the answer might be a middle ground. But according to the options, it's A or B. If I have to choose, maybe B, but with reservations. The user might be in a tough spot, but the way he handled it could be improved.\n"
