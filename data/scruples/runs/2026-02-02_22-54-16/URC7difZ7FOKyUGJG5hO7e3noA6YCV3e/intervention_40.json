It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for having their mom come stay with them after having a child. The situation is that the author and their wife had a baby four months ago. The wife isn't doing any housework beyond baby-related tasks. The author does most of the work, which is exhausting, especially since they work 45 hours a week. They tried talking to the wife about the workload, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author's mom offered to help, but the wife got angry when the author arranged for her to come. Then the author went ahead and invited the mom anyway, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both parents are new to having a baby, which can be really stressful. The author is doing most of the housework, which isn't uncommon for new parents, but it's causing burnout. The wife might be struggling with the transition to motherhood, dealing with sleep deprivation, and maybe feeling overwhelmed. She might not realize the extent of the author's workload or feel guilty about not contributing, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe author vented to their mom, who offered to help. The author tried to communicate with the wife, who was resistant. Then, feeling burnt out, the author decided to bring in their mom without the wife's permission. This could be seen as a breach of trust or an overstep, especially since the wife was clearly upset. However, the author might have felt they had no choice after repeated attempts to address the issue failed.\n\nIt's important to consider if the author consulted the wife adequately. They mentioned trying to talk to her and even saying they would invite the mom otherwise. But when the wife didn't change her behavior, the author acted. The wife's reaction was anger and feeling undermined, which is significant. The author might not have considered the wife's feelings about the mom's presence, especially if there were underlying tensions or if the wife felt her partner didn't trust her to handle things.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also struggling and making a decision to take care of their own well-being. The mom's help is providing necessary relief. However, the method of resolving the conflict by unilaterally bringing in a third party without resolving the underlying issue with the wife might have caused more harm. The wife's friend pointing out the issue might indicate that the author's approach was seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as a last resort, but it's possible they didn't handle the communication well enough. There might have been a better way to involve the wife in a solution without bringing in their mom. The key points are the communication breakdown and the unilateral decision. If the author had continued to work with the wife to find a compromise or seek counseling, maybe they could have avoided this conflict. But given the circumstances, the author's burnout is understandable. However, the way they acted might have been inconsiderate of the wife's feelings, leading to the wife feeling disrespected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide. If the answer is A, then the author is in the wrong for not respecting the wife's wishes and not handling the conflict better. If B, then the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to manage their own well-being and the situation was unsustainable.\n\nI think the answer is B because the author's intent was to manage their own stress and workload, but the approach could have been better. However, given the circumstances, it's a tough spot, and the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The main issue is the communication and how the decision was made, not the decision itself.\n"
