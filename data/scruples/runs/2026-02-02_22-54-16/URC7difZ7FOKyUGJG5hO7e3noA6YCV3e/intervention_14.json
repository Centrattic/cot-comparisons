It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He mentions that before the baby, their housework split was already unequal, with him doing 65-80% of the work. Now, since the baby, the wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, takes care of the baby so she can have time for herself, but then also has to do all the housework. He's tried asking for help, but she says she's too tired from the baby. He then tells his mom about the situation, and she offers to come stay for a couple of weeks to help out. The author arranges it without telling his wife, who gets angry and says they can handle it themselves. After a week with no change, the author brings his mom in anyway, leading to conflict. The wife is upset, and his mom is cold and possessive of the baby, but he gets relief.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for inviting his mom without his wife's permission?\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author feels overwhelmed, and the wife isn't contributing to housework, despite his requests. He's trying to manage work, baby care, and housework alone. The mom steps in as an external helper. The wife's reaction is anger, but maybe she's also feeling resentful or stressed, though the author's perspective is that she's not pulling her weight. \n\nFrom the author's side, he's trying to address a problem that's causing him significant stress and affecting their home life. He's tried communicating with his wife, but she's not responding. Inviting his mom could be seen as a last resort to prevent burnout and maintain their marriage. However, he didn't consult his wife, which could have been a better approach. Even though he was trying to help, not involving her might have hurt her feelings or undermined her authority in the household. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author didn't trust her to handle the situation or that he's taking sides against her by bringing in his mom without asking. The mom's arrival might have caused tension, especially if the wife feels her role as a mother is being questioned or that the author is not supporting her. The friend's comment about undermining the wife adds another layer, suggesting that the action might have been perceived as disrespectful.\n\nBut the author's main motivation was to alleviate his own exhaustion and prevent the situation from continuing. He had tried to communicate and failed, then gave a week for things to improve without success. His decision was based on his own well-being and the family's needs, perhaps prioritizing his mental health. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. While the author's intentions were good, the method of solving the problem without the wife's input could be problematic. Effective communication is key in relationships, and involving the wife in the decision might have led to a better solution. However, given the lack of cooperation from the wife and the author's justified stress, his actions might be understandable.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. His actions stem from a place of need and trying to find a solution when communication failed. However, a more collaborative approach would have been better. So the answer is B (No).\n"
