It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the wife isn't doing much housework, leading to the author being overwhelmed. The mom offers help, but the wife objects. The author decides to let the mom stay despite the wife's anger.\n\nPossible angles: Communication between the couple. Did the author and wife discuss the issue adequately? The author tried asking for help but the wife didn't respond. The author then went to their mom, which the wife was upset about. \n\nIs the author wrong for taking action? Well, in a relationship, both partners should share responsibilities, but the wife isn't contributing. The author tried to talk it out. When that didn't work, they sought external help. Inviting mom might have been a way to ease the burden, but it's important if they discussed this with the wife first. The author did mention they would arrange it with the wife, but then went ahead without consent. That could be seen as undermining the wife's autonomy. \n\nBut also, the author is exhausted and the wife isn't helping, so the mom's help was necessary. However, the way the author went about it without considering the wife's feelings might be problematic. The wife's reaction being upset is a sign that the approach wasn't respectful of her wishes. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on cultural or personal values. Some might say the author is right to prioritize their well-being, others that they should have handled it differently. But given the situation, maybe the answer is no\u2014the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they tried to solve a problem that wasn't being addressed. But the method of inviting mom without agreement might not be ideal. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not whether the method was perfect. \n\nThe author's actions were motivated by their own needs and the mom's offer. The wife's lack of support is a factor. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. The key is whether the author overstepped, but since they tried to communicate and the wife wasn't helping, maybe they weren't wrong.\n"
