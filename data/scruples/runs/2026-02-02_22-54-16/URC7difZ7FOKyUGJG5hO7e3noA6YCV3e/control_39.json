It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He mentions that the main issue has always been housework, with him doing the majority. Since the baby, the wife does even less, only things related to the baby. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, does all the housework, and the wife says she's too tired from the baby. He tried talking to her but she's resistant. Then his mom offers to help, and when the wife refuses, he invites the mom anyway after a week. The mom arrives, helps out, but the wife is upset and cold towards the baby. Friends also comment that the author undermined his wife.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual responsibilities in a marriage. The author tried to talk to his wife about the workload, but she didn't help. He felt overwhelmed and sought external help, which the wife didn't want. The question is whether inviting his mom without the wife's consent was wrong.\n\nMarriage requires teamwork. If both partners aren't contributing, it's a problem. However, the author did try to address it by asking his wife to help and discussing his exhaustion. When that failed, he took action. But bringing in his mom without his wife's agreement might be seen as undermining her authority and making unilateral decisions. The wife's feelings are important here; she was upset, which might indicate that he didn't handle the situation respectfully.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clearly struggling and the housework wasn't being shared. The mom's help improved his situation. However, the way he handled it\u2014ignoring his wife's wishes and bringing in family\u2014could be problematic. Maybe he should have found another solution first or sought couples counseling before involving his mom. Using a parent to intervene in a marital issue might not be the best approach and could create more tension.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author has valid concerns about the workload, but the method of resolution could be seen as disrespectful to his wife. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't collaborate enough or find alternative solutions before involving his mom.\n"
