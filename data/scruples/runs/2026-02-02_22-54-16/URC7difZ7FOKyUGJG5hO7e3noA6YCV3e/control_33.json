It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The main issue is that the wife isn't contributing to household chores. The author is doing most of the work, both at work and at home. He feels overwhelmed and has tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author then goes to his mom, who offers to come stay and help out. The wife gets angry when he brings this up and doesn't want the help. The author, feeling burnt out, brings his mom anyway without the wife's permission, leading to tension.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The author tried to discuss the problem with his wife but didn't get the support he needed. He then sought help from his mom, which the wife didn't agree with. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing his mom in without his wife's consent.\n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with a significant workload and stress. It's understandable that he's looking for support. On the other hand, bringing in his mom without his wife's approval might be seen as undermining her, especially if the wife felt that the situation was manageable without outside help. The wife's reaction suggests she values autonomy in handling their household, and the author's decision might have been a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the author did mention that he tried to communicate his needs to his wife. Maybe the wife didn't realize how overwhelmed he was, or perhaps she felt that her own exhaustion justified not contributing. The author's action could be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options. But by not respecting his wife's initial refusal and going ahead anyway, he might have caused more harm than good. Family dynamics can be complex, and involving another family member without consent can create additional stress and conflict.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's mom is trying to help, but the wife might perceive it as an intrusion. The author's justification is that he needed the help, but he should have maybe tried to find a middle ground, perhaps a compromise where both parties agree on the support. Since the wife was extremely upset, it's possible that the author didn't consider her feelings and the importance of teamwork in solving their problem together.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues collaboratively. The author might have acted out of frustration, but bypassing his wife's wishes could be seen as a lack of respect for her role and their partnership. The wife's friend's comment about undermining her points out that the action might have been disrespectful. While the author's intentions were to reduce his burden, the method might have been flawed. There's a balance between seeking help and respecting the partner's autonomy.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, the author's action of inviting his mom without his wife's consent after she refused could be seen as overstepping. He didn't fully respect her initial stance and the partnership's dynamics, which might make him partially at fault. However, his situation is also challenging, and the answer might depend on cultural context or how the family typically handles such issues. But based on the information given, the decision to proceed without consent seems to be where he's in the wrong.\n"
