It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the author is doing almost all the housework while the wife is taking care of the baby. He's working 45 hours a week, which isn't too bad, but when he gets home, he's exhausted and has to do all the chores. The wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby all day and doesn't help. The author tried asking for help, but she didn't do much.\n\nThen the author's mom offered to come stay for a couple of weeks to help out. The author was grateful and arranged for her to come without consulting his wife. The wife got angry and refused the help initially. The author then told his wife that if things didn't change, he'd invite his mom anyway. After a week, he brings his mom in, leading to the wife being upset and the mom being cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and boundaries. The author felt overwhelmed and thought inviting his mom would help. But he didn't discuss this with his wife, which might have been a mistake. The wife was against it, so perhaps the author should have tried to work it out with her first instead of bypassing her. However, the author's stress and the lack of support from his wife are also valid. The wife might be overextended with the baby, but she's not contributing to the household. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort after trying to communicate. But inviting his mom without consent might have been a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author's well-being is important too. It's a tough balance. The wife's friend's comment suggests that maybe the author crossed a line, but the wife's lack of cooperation complicates things. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not involving his wife in the decision-making, even if the underlying issues are real. The answer might depend on cultural norms too, where in some places, involving family without the partner's consent could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate properly and acted unilaterally, even if his reasons were valid.\n"
