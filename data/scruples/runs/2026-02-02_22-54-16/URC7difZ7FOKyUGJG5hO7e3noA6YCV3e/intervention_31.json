It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent couple dealing with household responsibilities and the husband involving his mom to help when the wife isn't contributing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is doing most of the housework, which he's okay with when it's just the two of them. After having a baby, the wife stops doing any housework except baby-related tasks. He's working 45 hours a week and coming home to do all the chores. He's tried asking her for help, but she says she's too tired. Then he turns to his mom, who offers to help, but the wife is upset when he brings her in without permission. The husband then proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of things not improving.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The husband is feeling overwhelmed and has made efforts to communicate his needs. The wife is not contributing to household tasks, which is causing strain. The husband's mom steps in to help, which is a common cultural practice in many families. However, the wife was not consulted or involved in the decision-making process, which could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's actions might be seen as taking control to relieve his own stress and improve the situation. On the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected that her feelings and autonomy were not considered. The husband could have handled it differently, perhaps by finding a compromise or involving the wife more in the decision to get external help. However, given the situation of burnout and lack of cooperation, his actions might be understandable.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he did go behind his wife's back and brought in his mom after she explicitly said they didn't need help. That could be seen as undermining her. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt her autonomy was ignored. The husband might have a valid point about needing help, but the method of getting that help without her consent could be problematic.\n\nSo, depending on the perspective. If the focus is on the husband's right to seek help when overwhelmed, then maybe not in the wrong. If the focus is on the wife's feelings and consent, then he might be in the wrong. The community's opinion on AITA threads often considers both communication and actions. Since the husband tried to talk to his wife and she refused, then he took action without her consent, which could be seen as a mistake. But he was acting out of necessity. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the husband was acting to alleviate his own and his wife's stress, even if the approach was flawed. However, the key point is that he didn't consult further. Maybe he should have tried more to involve her in the decision, but given her refusal to help, he had to act. So in the context of the situation, he's not in the wrong, but could have handled it better.\n"
