It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife stopped doing housework post-baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband does most of the housework, around 80%, even though he works 45 hours a week. He's exhausted, and the wife isn't helping. He tried talking to her, but she says she's too tired. He then mentions this to his mom, who offers to stay and help. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and says they don't need help. The husband proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's overwhelmed with work and household responsibilities. His wife isn't helping despite being asked, and he's trying to manage the baby. He communicated his struggles and the mom's help is a relief. He mentions that the mom has a good relationship with the wife, so maybe he thought it's okay. But he did proceed without the wife's consent after she refused, which could be a problem.\n\nFrom the wife's side, she's new to motherhood, which is exhausting. She might feel defensive or maybe there's an unspoken issue. The husband didn't get her permission, which could be seen as disrespectful. Inviting someone into their home without agreement might breach trust, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe wife's friend comments that the husband undermined her, which is a social cue that others might see this as a problem. The key here is whether the husband's action was a reasonable response to his stress or an overstep.\n\nAlso, consider communication. The husband tried talking to the wife but didn't resolve it. Maybe he should have sought couples counseling or a mediator instead of bringing in his mom. But given the stress of new parenthood and his own work, he's at his breaking point. The mom's help is helping the family, but the method of inviting her without consent could be the issue.\n\nSo, the husband's intent was to help the family, but the way he did it might have been wrong. He should have tried to find a compromise with his wife first. Inviting the mom without her consent after she refused could be seen as disrespectful. However, his struggle is valid. The answer might be a balance, but according to the question's options (A or B), which is simpler. \n\nThe friend's comment implies that undermining the wife is a problem, and the wife's anger is a reaction to his unilateral decision. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if his reasons are understandable. So answer A.\n"
