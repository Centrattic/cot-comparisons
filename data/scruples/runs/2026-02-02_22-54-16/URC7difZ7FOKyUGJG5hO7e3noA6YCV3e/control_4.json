It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and since then, the author is doing all the housework while the wife isn't helping much. The author works 45 hours a week, which isn't too bad, but when he comes home, he's already tired from work and then has to do all the household chores. He tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby all day. The author then confides in his mom, who offers to come stay and help out. When the author tells his wife, she gets angry and insists they can handle it themselves. But the author proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change, leading to tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the division of labor after having a baby. The author feels he's doing 80-90% of the housework, which is taking a toll on him. He's tried communicating with his wife, but she's not helping. The author then uses his mom as a solution without his wife's consent. The wife is upset, and the mom's presence has caused some tension, especially with her being possessive of the baby. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. From the author's perspective, he's doing all the work and is overwhelmed. He's tried to communicate his needs, but his wife isn't responding. He reaches out to his mom for support, which is a natural step. By inviting his mom without his wife's consent, he's taking unilateral action. The wife's reaction is understandable\u2014if her partner brings in family without her agreement, that could feel like a breach of trust or autonomy. \n\nBut then again, the author is trying to manage the household and his own well-being. The wife isn't contributing, and he's at the point of burnout. The mom's help is a temporary solution to alleviate the situation. The question is whether the author had the right to make that decision without discussing it further with his wife. Was there a better approach? Maybe he should have tried to resolve the issue through more open communication or counseling before bringing in his mom. However, the wife's refusal to help is also a significant part of the problem.\n\nAnother angle: inviting a parent into the household after a spouse's objection could be seen as undermining the spouse's authority or wishes. The wife might feel disrespected or that her ability to manage the household is being questioned. On the other hand, the author is trying to take care of himself and his family's needs. The mom's presence might not have been ideal for the wife, especially if the mom is possessive of the baby, which complicates things further.\n\nIs the author wrong for not respecting his wife's initial refusal? Or is he justified in taking action when his wife isn't contributing and he's overwhelmed? It's a bit of a gray area. In relationships, communication is key. The author could have been more proactive in seeking a solution together with his wife before bringing in his mom. However, given the circumstances of exhaustion and lack of support, his actions might be seen as a necessary step to prevent burnout.\n\nBut bringing in external help without mutual agreement can strain the relationship. The wife's friend's comment about undermining her suggests that society often views unilateral decisions in such situations as disrespectful. The author's response that it's between him and his wife might not address the underlying issue of communication breakdown.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action could be seen as a mistake because he didn't find a collaborative solution first. However, his intentions were to alleviate his own and his family's stress. It's a tough call. The right answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about family roles and conflict resolution. But generally, in relationship advice, it's often recommended to seek solutions together rather than taking actions that might be perceived as against the spouse's wishes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's initial refusal without exhausting other options.\n"
