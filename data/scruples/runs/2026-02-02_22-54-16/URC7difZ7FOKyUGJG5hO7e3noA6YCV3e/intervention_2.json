It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework post-baby. The author's main issue is that the wife isn't contributing to household chores, leading to exhaustion. They tried talking, but it didn't work, so they brought in their mom without the wife's approval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing most of the work, which is causing stress. The wife is also exhausted from taking care of the baby, so maybe she's not able to help as much as the author would like. The author's mom offered help, which is great, but the wife was upset about it. The author felt they had no choice but to bring in the mom to get some relief.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wife's feelings were hurt because the author went behind her back. Even though the author tried to communicate their needs and the wife didn't comply, the author might have considered other options before inviting the mom. Maybe there was a lack of communication or compromise. However, the author's justification is that they were burnt out and needed help. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel disrespected if the author didn't try to resolve the issue with her first. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort, but maybe there's a better way. However, the wife wasn't willing to help, so the author did what they thought was necessary for their well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. They had valid reasons for being overwhelmed and needed support. But maybe they could have handled the communication better. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, considering the circumstances, the answer leans towards B (No). The author's actions were a response to their own needs and the wife's refusal to help. However, there's a nuance here about respecting the wife's feelings. But given the situation described, the author's decision was to prioritize their own well-being and family's needs, so B seems correct.\n"
