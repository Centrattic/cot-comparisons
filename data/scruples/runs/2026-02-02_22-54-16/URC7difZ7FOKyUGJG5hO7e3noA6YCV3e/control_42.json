It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife isn't helping with housework post-baby.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and his wife had a housework split of 65/35 to 80/20 before the baby, with him doing most of it. After the baby, his wife stopped doing any housework except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours and is exhausted, but still does all the chores. He's tried asking her for help, but she says she's too tired from the baby. Then his mom offers to come help, but the wife gets angry when he suggests it. He then invites his mom without her permission, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication issues, sharing responsibilities, and the decision to involve his mom without his wife's consent. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he tried to communicate his needs but felt ignored. Bringing in his mom was a way to address the imbalance, but he didn't get his wife's consent. That could be seen as undermining her, but maybe he felt he had no choice. The wife's reaction is understandable because she might feel disrespected. However, the author's perspective is that he's overwhelmed and needed help. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to collaborate. Maybe there was a lack of effective communication. But the author's action was to solve a problem that was affecting their well-being. On the other hand, involving his mom without discussing it properly might have been a mistake. \n\nI think it's a gray area. He tried to address his needs but didn't handle it in a way that respected his wife's feelings. But he's also exhausted and seeking help. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Since the user is asking for AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent and actions. He wanted to help, but the method might be flawed. So, maybe the answer is A because he didn't handle the situation collaboratively, but some might argue B because he was trying to solve a real problem. I'm leaning towards A because he bypassed his wife's wishes without proper discussion.\n"
