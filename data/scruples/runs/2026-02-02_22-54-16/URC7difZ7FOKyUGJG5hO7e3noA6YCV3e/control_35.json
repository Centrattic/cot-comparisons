It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nSo the situation is: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The author mentions that before the baby, their housework split was 65/35 in his favor, but after the baby, his wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted. His wife asks him to take the baby so she can have time for herself, but then he has to do all the chores. He's tried asking for help, and she responds that she's too tired from taking care of the baby. He then brings in his mom to help, which his wife is upset about. The mom arrives, and the wife is angry, even getting yelled at. The author defends his actions, saying he invited the mom to help because he was burnt out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is taking on most of the household responsibilities and work, which is leading to exhaustion. His wife isn't contributing to the chores, only doing baby-related tasks. He tried to communicate and ask for help, but she refuses. He then brings in his mom without his wife's consent after she refused. The wife is upset because her autonomy is being overruled.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and mutual respect. The author tried to talk to his wife and didn't get the help he needed. He then made a unilateral decision to bring in his mom, which might be seen as undermining his wife's wishes. However, his motivation was to address his burnout and the unequal distribution of labor. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to seek help if he's being overwhelmed and his requests are ignored. On the other hand, bringing in a third party without his wife's consent could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the wife was clear she didn't need help. The mom's presence might also be causing tension in the marriage. \n\nBut the wife isn't contributing to the housework beyond baby care, which the author finds unreasonable. The author's actions might be justified if his wife is not meeting her responsibilities, but the method of bringing in his mom without consent could be problematic. However, the author did try to talk to his wife first. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Some might argue that the author is in the right because he was trying to fix an unfair situation. Others might say he should have handled it differently, maybe by seeking couples counseling or finding another solution before bringing in his mom. But given the circumstances, if the wife is not contributing and the author is exhausted, his decision to get external help might be understandable.\n\nHowever, the act of inviting his mom without his wife's permission after she refused could be seen as disrespectful. The wife might feel disrespected or that her needs aren't being considered. But the author's perspective is that he was at his breaking point and needed relief.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many cases, couples are expected to work through these issues together. By involving his mom, he might have bypassed that process, which could be seen as wrong. However, if the wife is not willing to cooperate and the author is suffering, it's a tough spot. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author made an effort to communicate and only took action after his wife refused help. But there's a counterargument that he should have handled it differently. But given the options, B seems more justified because he was trying to address his and his family's well-being.\n"
