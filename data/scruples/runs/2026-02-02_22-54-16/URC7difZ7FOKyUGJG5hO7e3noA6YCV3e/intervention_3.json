It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He mentions that before the baby, the housework split was already 65/35 in his favor, but now it's more like 80/20, especially after the baby. He works 45 hours, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. He tried asking for help but she won't do anything. Then his mom offers to come stay and help, which he accepts. The wife gets angry when he tells her, and he invites the mom anyway after a week. The wife is upset, and the mom is cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nHmm. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for inviting his mom. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the wife is dealing with a newborn, which is a huge responsibility. She might be overwhelmed, even if she's not doing the housework. Maybe she's experiencing postpartum issues or just the normal exhaustion. The author tried to communicate his needs but didn't get any help. Maybe he felt like he had no choice but to get his mom involved. But on the other hand, inviting in a parent without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining her. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinion wasn't considered. The author could have tried more communication strategies before bringing in his mom. However, he did try, and things didn't change. The mom's arrival might have been a necessary step to prevent burnout. The friend's comment suggests that the wife's friends see the action as undermining her. But maybe the author's mom is providing needed support that the couple can't manage alone. So, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. He wanted to help himself and the family, but the method might have been abrupt. However, given the circumstances, maybe he's in the right because he tried to address the problem and needed help. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
