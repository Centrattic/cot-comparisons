It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reached out (the author) is in the wrong for allowing his mom to stay with them after they had a baby. The key points here are the family dynamics and the responsibilities around housework.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that before the baby, their wife did about 35% of the housework, which shifted to almost nothing after the baby. He works 45 hours and is doing all the chores. He tried to communicate his stress, but his wife is also exhausted from taking care of the baby. The author then brings in his mom for help, which the wife didn't want. The mom's presence caused tension, and the wife is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom without the wife's consent. On one hand, the author feels overwhelmed and neglected his own needs. He tried to address the issue with his wife but didn't get support, so he took action. On the other hand, he bypassed his wife's decision, which might have been a breach of trust or partnership. \n\nBut considering that the wife wasn't helping at all and he was the sole provider and caretaker, the author might have felt it was necessary for his well-being and the baby's care. The mom's help improved the situation for him and allowed the family to have some time to socialize. However, the method of handling it without discussing it thoroughly with his wife could be seen as a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did mention his struggles to his wife, but maybe didn't address the root of her exhaustion adequately. Maybe the wife felt that the author didn't support her enough, leading to her resistance to outside help. Inviting the mom without her consent could be seen as undermining her, even if his intention was to help. \n\nBut the alternative is enduring an unsustainable situation, which can lead to burnout. The author's mom stepping in might have been a necessary relief valve. However, relationships require mutual agreement, especially when involving family. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because his actions were driven by necessity, but he could have handled it differently, perhaps seeking couples counseling before bringing in the mom.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer is a bit nuanced. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the community is being asked, some might side with the author due to the extreme workload, while others might say he should have communicated better with his wife first. Given the information, the author's actions were a response to unmet needs, but the method was problematic. However, in some perspectives, the relief provided by the mom's help was justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because his intention was to address an unsustainable situation, but it's a close call.\n"
