It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with them after his wife refuses help. So first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He's been doing most of the housework, which was already an 80/20 split before the baby. Now, the wife is doing almost none, only baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and does all the chores. He's tried asking for help but the wife says she's too tired. The mom offers to help for a couple of weeks, but the wife gets angry when the author brings it up. After a week of no change, he invites the mom anyway. The wife is upset, the mom is cold, and now the wife's friend is criticizing him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about household responsibilities and communication. The author feels overwhelmed and his wife isn't contributing, leading him to take drastic action. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions they have a good relationship except for housework. The wife, however, is the primary caregiver for the baby, which is a lot. But she's also not doing any housework except baby-related tasks. He's working a full-time job and doing all the chores. That's a lot for anyone. He's tried discussing it and asking for help, but she refuses.\n\nThe mom offered to help, which the author took as a good solution. The wife didn't want her help, but the author decided to proceed without her consent. The wife felt undermined, which could be valid if the author didn't involve her enough in the decision-making process. However, the author felt he had no choice after exhausting other options.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did communicate his needs and tried to resolve it before bringing in his mom. The problem is that the wife didn't meet his needs despite his efforts, so he took action to take care of himself and the baby. On the other hand, he didn't consult her enough on the mom's visit, which could have been a way to show more respect for her feelings.\n\nBut given the context, the author was at his breaking point. He had a valid reason to seek help, especially since his wife wasn't contributing. The mom's help improved the situation for him. However, the way he did it without fully involving his wife might have contributed to her feeling disrespected. There's a balance between self-care and respecting a partner's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the author had tried more collaborative problem-solving before taking unilateral action, maybe it would have been better. But given the circumstances, his decision might be seen as necessary for his well-being and the family's benefit. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could have been better.\n"
