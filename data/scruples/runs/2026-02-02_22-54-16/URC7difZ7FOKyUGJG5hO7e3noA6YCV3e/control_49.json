It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing his mom to stay with his wife and him after having a baby. The situation is that the author and his wife have a housework imbalance, with him doing most of it. After the baby was born, the wife stopped doing housework except for baby-related tasks. He tried to ask for help, but she said she was too tired. Then the author's mom offered to help, but the wife didn't want her to come. The author went ahead and invited the mom anyway after a week without change.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author felt overwhelmed and unappreciated, the wife isn't contributing to housework, and he decided to bring in his mom without his wife's consent. The wife got angry, and the mom was cold and possessive of the baby. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author and wife had a pre-existing imbalance, but it's been manageable until the baby. Now, with the added stress of parenting, the wife is not helping, leading to the author's exhaustion. He tried to communicate, but it didn't work. Then he involved his mom without consulting the wife. \n\nOn one hand, the author had valid reasons for feeling overwhelmed and sought help. On the other hand, bringing in his mom without the wife's consent might have been a breach of trust and respect. Even though the wife didn't help, the author's decision to bypass her could have been a mistake. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement, especially when involving family. The wife's reaction was anger, which might indicate that the author didn't handle the situation properly. \n\nAlso, the mother's behavior being cold and possessive might have added to the tension. Maybe the author didn't consider how this would affect their relationship or the potential conflicts with the mother-in-law. However, the author's main issue was not being able to cope alone. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were necessary and how they were communicated. Since he tried to talk to his wife and she didn't respond, the author might feel justified. However, involving his mom without her consent could be seen as overstepping, even if he was desperate. So, is he in the wrong? Possibly, because he didn't resolve it through communication and instead took unilateral action, which can damage trust. But maybe it's a gray area. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I'm leaning towards A because he didn't get his wife's approval, even if the intention was good. But some might say B because he was trying to survive the stress. Hmm.\n"
