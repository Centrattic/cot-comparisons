It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife refused help. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that after having a baby, their wife stopped doing housework except for baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week and is handling all the chores, which is causing exhaustion. They tried talking to the wife, but she claims to be too tired and doesn't help. The mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when the author goes ahead and invites her without permission.\n\nSo, the key points here are the distribution of chores, communication issues, and the decision to involve the mom without the wife's consent. \n\nThe author is in a stressful situation with unequal responsibilities. They tried to communicate their needs but didn't get the support they needed. Inviting the mom might be a way to manage the stress and get some relief. However, the author did go against the wife's wishes, which could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting her feelings. The wife's reaction is valid because she was upset about the intrusion, even if the mom is helping. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also a parent trying to balance work and family, and their well-being is important. The wife's refusal to share chores is creating a burden that the author can't handle alone. The mom's help is a temporary solution to prevent burnout. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had valid reasons for feeling overwhelmed and sought help. However, the method of bringing in the mom without the wife's consent might have been a misstep in communication. The author should have perhaps tried more communication strategies before taking that step. But given the circumstances, their actions might be understandable. The answer might depend on cultural expectations as well. In some cultures, involving family is common, while others prefer independence. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. The main issue is the lack of mutual support between the couple. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to alleviate stress and the wife's refusal to help was a contributing factor.\n"
