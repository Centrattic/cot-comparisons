It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author inviting his mom to stay with his wife after the birth of their child because his wife isn't doing any housework. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions that he and his wife had a housework imbalance even before the baby, with him doing around 65-80% of the chores. After the baby, his wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week and is exhausted, but still does all the housework. He tries to get his wife to help but she says she's too tired. He then tells his mom, who offers to help. When he brings this up to his wife, she's angry and refuses help. He proceeds to invite his mom anyway, leading to tension.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is under a lot of stress, and the wife's refusal to help is making things worse. He's trying to get support from his mom, which is a common family dynamic. On the other hand, did he communicate effectively with his wife? He tried to talk to her, but when she refused, he went behind her back. That could be seen as undermining her, especially in front of friends.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable if she feels her autonomy is being taken away. Inviting someone into the home without mutual agreement can create conflict. However, the author's situation is also valid because he's overwhelmed and the wife isn't contributing. The key here is communication. Did the author give his wife enough time to resolve the issue? He gave a week, but maybe that's too short. Also, the mom's presence might be helpful, but the way it was handled could have been better.\n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, sometimes it's common for parents to help with new babies, but the method of introduction matters. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking help, but perhaps he should have found a better solution with his wife first, like couples counseling or setting clearer boundaries. However, the wife's lack of cooperation is also a problem. \n\nI think the answer is not black and white, but since the user wants a binary choice, I need to decide. The author did act without his wife's consent after a week, which might be a misstep. However, his motivation was to alleviate his stress and the situation had been ongoing. Maybe he's not entirely wrong. The wife's behavior is also a significant part of the problem. The mom's help is a positive outcome. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
