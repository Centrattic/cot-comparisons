I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline the author provides shows that the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details of the dinner. Initially, the author was told the SOs were invited, then it became a work party where the author could make other plans, then it was narrowed down to only certain people. The boss sending a car service on the day of the event seems suspicious, especially when the author points out that the invitees are all under 30 and female. The boss's quick response and insistence on the car service might indicate he's trying to avoid the partners of the invitees, which could imply inappropriate intentions.\n\nThe author feels that the situation is shady and wants to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from going, fearing potential misconduct from the boss. The fianc\u00e9, however, dismisses these concerns, calling the author controlling and accusing him of being an asshole. She even says the boss can't do anything because he's married, which the author interprets as her recognizing the risk. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is expressing concern for his fianc\u00e9's safety and well-being. He's not outright forbidding her, but he's voicing his discomfort with the setup. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is defensive, and she's choosing to go despite his concerns. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author shares his concerns based on the timeline and evidence he's gathered. It's reasonable for him to be worried given the boss's history and the unusual circumstances of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might feel her autonomy is being questioned, leading to conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's making a reasonable request based on valid concerns and the fianc\u00e9 is ignoring them, it's hard to say he's at fault. However, if he's being overly controlling without sufficient evidence, that could be an issue. The boss's past as a shady character and the specific details about the dinner (age, gender of invitees, last-minute car service) add weight to the author's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's assertion that the boss can't do anything because he's married might actually support the author's fears that there's a risk involved.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are important. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is a natural response. However, if his actions are preventing her from making her own decisions without sufficient reason, that could be problematic. But given the evidence presented, it seems like the author has legitimate reasons to be worried. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). He's acting on valid concerns and trying to communicate his feelings, even if the approach is stressful for both parties.\n"
