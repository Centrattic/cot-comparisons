I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to go to a dinner with her boss. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a fianc\u00e9 who's noticed some shady behavior from the boss. The timeline shows that the boss kept changing his story about the dinner, first saying the fianc\u00e9's SO was invited, then it's just a work party, then narrowing down the invitees to two young female employees. The boss even arranges a car service, which seems suspicious because it might be avoiding the fianc\u00e9 driving. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about the boss's intentions, especially given the boss's reputation as a scammer. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's points are valid. The boss's actions seem to be creating opportunities for alone time with the employees, which is inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect their partner from a potentially dangerous situation. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have handled it differently. Instead of just forbidding her to go, maybe discussing concerns calmly and finding a solution together would have been better. But the fianc\u00e9's actions stem from valid concerns about the boss's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's partner seems dismissive of these concerns, which is concerning. If the shoe were on the other foot, she would likely react the same way. The fianc\u00e9 is acting out of protection, not control, even though their approach might come off as controlling. The boss's actions are suspicious, and the fianc\u00e9 is right to be cautious. So while the fianc\u00e9's method could be improved, the underlying concern is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
