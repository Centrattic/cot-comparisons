I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to dinner with her boss. The author is frustrated and even considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author's fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a boss who has a shady reputation. The boss is taking a few young female employees to dinner, and there's a pattern of last-minute changes, like offering a car service even after being told the author knows the restaurant. The author feels this is suspicious and wants to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from going, leading to a big argument where she calls him controlling.\n\nThe key points here are the boss's reputation, the unusual circumstances around the dinner invitation, and the fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude. The author is acting out of concern for potential harassment or impropriety, especially given the boss's history. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics, it's common for partners to have concerns about their significant other interacting with someone who has a questionable reputation. The author isn't forbidding her from social interactions outright but is reacting to specific red flags. The boss's actions, like insisting on a car service after the author is supposed to know the venue, could indicate an attempt to isolate the employee, which is a red flag for potential misconduct.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's boss being married and the author's argument about the implications suggest that there's an understanding of the potential risks. The author is trying to protect his partner from possible harassment or a situation that could lead to complications, especially since the firm's boss is already seen as untrustworthy.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as controlling. Insisting she not go without discussing it calmly could be seen as overstepping. Healthy relationships involve communication, so while the concern is valid, the method of handling it could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9's reaction also indicates that she feels her autonomy is being challenged, which is a valid point.\n\nBut given the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances of the dinner, the author's wariness is not unfounded. The pattern of the invitation changing and the boss's insistence on a car service after knowing the author can drive might be attempts to create a private setting, which could be dangerous. The author is acting on these red flags, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled the situation with more communication and less confrontation, his underlying concerns are valid. The fianc\u00e9's boss's reputation and the specific circumstances of the dinner create a situation where it's reasonable to be cautious. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially harmful situation.\n"
