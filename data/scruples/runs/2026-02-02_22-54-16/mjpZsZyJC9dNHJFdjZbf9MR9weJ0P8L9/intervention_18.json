I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is engaged to someone, and there's a conflict about the fianc\u00e9e going to a dinner with her boss. The author is really upset about it, even to the point of considering breaking off the engagement. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, let me look at the timeline and details provided. The boss is part of a law firm that has a reputation for being shady, with commercials that might be a bit over the top. The boss himself is described as an ambulance chaser or scammer. The author has met him and felt uncomfortable. The dinner is supposed to be a celebration of the firm's biggest year ever. The fianc\u00e9e initially said both partners were invited, then it changed to just a work party, then it became clear only some people were invited. Then the list narrowed down to two people, both young and female, and the boss offered a car service. The fianc\u00e9e is being picked up by the boss's car service, and the author is really worried this is a set-up for something inappropriate.\n\nThe author is concerned about the situation because of the boss's reputation and the way the dinner invitation is being handled. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, seems to think the author is being controlling and doesn't see the red flags. The author is using the evidence he's gathered over time to justify his concern, but the fianc\u00e9e is dismissing it.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author overreacting? Well, the boss's reputation is a big red flag. The way the dinner was organized, with a car service offered at the last minute, and only two young female employees being invited, seems suspicious. The author's concerns are based on concrete details and a pattern of behavior from the boss. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is downplaying the situation, which could indicate she might not be seeing the potential risks.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is having valid concerns. If there are legitimate reasons to be worried about a partner's safety or the potential for impropriety, raising those concerns isn't controlling\u2014it's being protective. The author isn't preventing her from going; he's expressing his fears and trying to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling him a controlling asshole might be a defense mechanism to avoid confronting the real issue.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author is projecting or being overly suspicious without concrete evidence of wrongdoing from the boss. But given the context of the boss's reputation and the specific circumstances of the dinner, the author's concerns aren't baseless. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e herself acknowledges the boss is married but still insists on going might show she's aware of the potential issues but is choosing to ignore them, which could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the author is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and the implications of the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is dismissing his valid concerns and reacting negatively. While couples should communicate and make decisions together, the author is not preventing her from going but is voicing his objections based on a pattern of events that suggest a problematic setup. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. He's raising legitimate concerns in a situation that has multiple red flags. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to acknowledge these concerns and her defensive reaction might be the real issue here.\n"
