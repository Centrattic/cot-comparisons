I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, and the author is really upset about it. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, especially the boss, who's an ambulance chaser. The author has met the boss and feels uncomfortable around him. Now, the boss is taking some staff, including the fianc\u00e9e, to a dinner to celebrate the firm's biggest year ever. The author is worried because the invitees are mostly young women, and the boss is arranging a car service for them. The fianc\u00e9e insists on going, and the author is threatening to end the relationship if she does. They've had arguments, and now the fianc\u00e9e is locked in the room, upset.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). So, the question is whether he's overstepping or not. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nJealousy and trust issues come to mind. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions given the setup. The boss is known for being unethical, and the way the dinner is arranged (car service, last-minute changes) makes the author suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see anything wrong. She thinks the author is being controlling. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big factor. If there's a lack of trust, it can lead to conflict. But is the author justified in his concern? The boss's reputation might make the situation more delicate. The fact that only young women are invited, and the boss is arranging transportation, could be seen as creating a situation where inappropriate behavior is possible. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially risky scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her partner doesn't trust her, which is a valid feeling. She's an adult and might feel her autonomy is being questioned. The author's reaction is intense\u2014he's considering breaking off the engagement. That's a serious step. While his concerns might be valid, the way he's handling it (calling her a controlling asshole, threatening to end the relationship) might be too harsh. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the boss has a history of unethical behavior and there are red flags in the way the dinner is being arranged, the author's wariness isn't baseless. However, he should also consider that his fianc\u00e9e might have her own boundaries and the right to make her own decisions. The balance between protecting her and respecting her autonomy is tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e's response. She's locking herself in, which indicates she's hurt and maybe feeling attacked. The author's approach might be confrontational rather than collaborative. Instead of trying to control the situation, maybe discussing boundaries and ensuring safety measures (like having a friend nearby or agreeing on a code word) could be a better approach. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not black and white. The author has valid concerns, but his reaction might be too extreme. The fianc\u00e9e, while perhaps not seeing the danger, is also within her rights to want to attend a work event. However, the boss's behavior and the firm's reputation add layers of risk. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling concerned, but his method of handling it might be problematic. The question is whether he's overstepping by forbidding her to go. Since they're engaged, it's a serious relationship, and both partners should have mutual trust. If the author can't trust her to handle the situation, that's a deeper issue. However, the situation with the boss does raise legitimate safety concerns. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's concerns are valid, but his approach might be too controlling. However, given the context of the boss's behavior, he's trying to protect her. It's a tough call. But since the question is about being in the wrong, I think the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because the situation has valid concerns, and it's a matter of differing perceptions rather than him being the asshole.\n"
