I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to go to a dinner with her boss, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, especially the boss, who's portrayed as a scammer. The author is worried about the boss's intentions, especially since the dinner is being arranged with a car service. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details of the event, which made the author suspicious. The boss insists on a car service even after the author suggests taking the car together, which adds to the red flags. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is voicing concerns about their fianc\u00e9's safety and possibly inappropriate situations. The boss is a known ambulance chaser, and the dinner is with a group of young female employees. The author's concerns might be justified because of the boss's reputation and the way the arrangements are being made. The fianc\u00e9 downplays the issues, which could indicate she's not aware of the potential risks or is choosing to ignore them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making decisions without the fianc\u00e9's consent, which could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is defensive, and the author is threatening to break off the engagement, which is a serious response. The question is whether the author's actions are protective or overbearing.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author is trying to protect their partner from a potentially uncomfortable or dangerous situation. However, the way they handle it\u2014by not letting the fianc\u00e9 go and using texts as evidence\u2014might come off as controlling. The fianc\u00e9's boss is married, so maybe the author is overreacting, but the pattern of the events (changing the event details, the car service) does raise legitimate concerns.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because their concerns are based on real red flags. However, their approach might be too harsh. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might be B (No). The author is justified in being concerned about their fianc\u00e9's safety, even if their reaction is strong. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior is questionable, and the author is trying to protect their partner. So, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
