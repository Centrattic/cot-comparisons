I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, the timeline: the boss keeps changing the details of the event, which is suspicious. Starting with the SO being invited, then down to a work party, then narrowing the invitees to young female employees. The boss offers a car service on the day, which seems like a possible attempt to create a situation where the fianc\u00e9e is alone with him.\n\nThe author is worried about the boss's intentions, especially given the boss's reputation. The fianc\u00e9e is dismissive, even after the author points out the red flags. She accuses him of being controlling. The author's concern isn't just jealousy; there are actual signs of manipulation and possible ulterior motives from the boss. \n\nIn relationships, it's natural to have concerns about a partner's interactions with others, especially in ambiguous situations. The author isn't forbidding her from going out socially but is raising valid points about the boss's behavior. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems defensive and dismissive, which could indicate she's aware of the potential issues but is downplaying them. \n\nThe key factors here are the changing details of the event, the boss's reputation, the selective invitation, and the last-minute car service. These elements create a scenario that's ripe for misuse. The author's actions stem from protecting his fianc\u00e9e and their relationship, which is understandable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's argument that the boss is married and can't do anything doesn't hold up because the situation is still inappropriate regardless of the boss's marital status. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. It's a matter of trusting one's instincts when something feels off.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's boss's actions and the situation's setup are problematic, and the author is rightly concerned. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of these concerns is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
