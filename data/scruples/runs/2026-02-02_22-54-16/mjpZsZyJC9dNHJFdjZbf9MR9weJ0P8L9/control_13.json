I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a shady reputation. The boss is known for being unethical. The author is concerned about his fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with this boss, especially after a series of events that make the dinner seem fishy. The boss is sending a car service, and the author is worried about potential inappropriate situations.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the red flags. The fianc\u00e9 initially said the SOs were invited, then changed her mind, and then it turned out only certain people were invited. The author noticed that the invitees were young females, which raises concerns. The boss's insistence on sending a car service despite the fianc\u00e9 having a partner makes the author even more uneasy.\n\nThe author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially problematic situation. His concerns are based on observed inconsistencies and the boss's behavior. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, dismisses these concerns and wants to go, even calling the author controlling. \n\nThe question is whether the author is overreacting. In relationships, trust is important, but so is recognizing potential risks. The author isn't acting out of jealousy but from genuine safety concerns. The boss's actions\u2014last-minute changes, offering a car service when the fianc\u00e9 has a partner\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The author is trying to prevent a situation that could lead to ethical or emotional issues.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response suggests she doesn't see the problem, but the author has valid reasons to be cautious. It's about protecting each other from potential harm. The author isn't being controlling without cause; he's reacting to specific behaviors that warrant concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
