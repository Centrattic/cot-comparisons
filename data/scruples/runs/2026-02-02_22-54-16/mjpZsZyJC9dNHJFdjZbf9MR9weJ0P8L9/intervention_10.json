I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 being invited to dinner with her boss, and the author is really concerned about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm known for questionable practices. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser. The author is worried because the boss is sending a car service to pick up the fianc\u00e9, and only younger female employees are being invited. The fianc\u00e9 is going despite the author's objections, and she's accusing him of being controlling. The author feels the situation is shady and wants her not to go, but she insists on attending.\n\nNow, considering the timeline: the fianc\u00e9 initially said the SOs could come, then changed her mind, then narrowed the invite list to two young women. The boss's insistence on sending a car adds to the red flags. The author is concerned about potential impropriety, maybe even harassment. The fianc\u00e9, however, seems dismissive of these concerns, even when confronted with the evidence. She's defending her decision and even more determined to go, which makes the author think she might be in denial or not seeing the risks.\n\nI need to assess if the author is overreacting. On one hand, the boss's behavior (changing plans last minute, sending a car) could be inappropriate. The fact that only young female employees are invited raises suspicion. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is understandable. On the other hand, maybe the author is being overly controlling, especially if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. However, given the context and the boss's reputation, the author's concerns seem valid.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is also a point. She's calling him a controlling asshole, but she's aware of the implications (he's married) yet still insists on going. That suggests she might not recognize the potential dangers. The author is using evidence from their timeline to support his concerns, which is reasonable. He's not trying to control her but to prevent a risky situation.\n\nIn terms of societal views, in a relationship, it's common for partners to have concerns about interactions with authority figures, especially when there's a power imbalance. The key is whether the author is respecting her autonomy while expressing his concerns. However, the boss's actions here are questionable, so the author's hesitance isn't unwarranted.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is likely not in the wrong. He's acting on legitimate concerns based on the boss's behavior and the suspicious circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of his worries and insistence on attending might indicate she's not taking the situation seriously, which could be her fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
