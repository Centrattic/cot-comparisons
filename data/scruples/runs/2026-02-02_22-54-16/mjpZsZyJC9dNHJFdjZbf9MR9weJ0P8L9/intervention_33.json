I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's really frustrated because his fianc\u00e9 is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a shady lawyer from a firm that's known for ambulance-chasing. The timeline shows that the boss was initially inviting the whole staff, then it got narrowed down to just a few people, specifically young females. Then the boss offers a car service, which the fianc\u00e9 finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the situation, but his fianc\u00e9 is dismissing his concerns, calling him controlling. The author is now considering breaking off the relationship and is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's main issue is the boss's behavior toward his fianc\u00e9, which seems to be increasingly focused and possibly predatory. The boss is changing the event from a staff celebration to a more exclusive dinner with young, female employees, and offering a car service. The fianc\u00e9 is not seeing the red flags, which is causing the author stress.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's about trust and concern. The author is trying to express his worries based on observations, which is a normal part of a relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9 is perceiving his concerns as controlling. The question is whether the author's concerns are valid or if he's overstepping.\n\nI should consider the boss's actions. The exclusivity of the dinner, the gender and age of the invitees, and the last-minute car service. These could be signs of inappropriate intentions. In many workplaces, such behavior by a boss could be seen as unprofessional, especially if employees are being singled out. The fact that the boss is known for being a \"shyster and scammer\" in the firm's commercials adds to the perception that he might have ulterior motives.\n\nThe author's actions are based on his observations and the timeline of events. He communicated his concerns, provided evidence (texts and emails), and tried to discuss it. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is defensive, which might indicate that she's aware of the implications but still chooses to ignore them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing legitimate concerns about his significant other's safety and the potential for a conflict of interest or harassment. It's not about controlling per se, but about being protective and seeing patterns that others might not. However, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the author is using evidence to pressure her into not going, that could be seen as controlling. But if he's genuinely concerned and trying to protect her, that's a different matter.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that the boss can't do anything that would affect his marriage is a bit confusing. It might suggest that the boss is already married, so he's not likely to act on any inappropriate intentions, but the author is still worried. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags could be a problem. \n\nI think the author's concerns are valid, but the way he handles the situation matters. If he's communicated his feelings without being overly controlling, then he's not wrong. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal and labeling him as a \"controlling asshole\" without considering the evidence could be her issue. \n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he's raising concerns based on observed behavior that could be problematic. However, the relationship dynamics play a role here. If the author is using the evidence to manipulate or control, that's different. But from the description, it seems like he's trying to protect her and is justified in being cautious.\n"
