I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss, leading to a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit sketchy. The boss is a shady character. The dinner was initially supposed to include spouses, then changed to a work party, then narrowed down to specific people. The fianc\u00e9 found out that only two people were invited\u2014herself and another young female colleague. The boss sends a car service, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem, and the author is frustrated, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is being controlling or if there's legitimate cause for concern. The author's concerns are based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. The boss's repeated insistence on providing a car service might imply that having a spouse present isn't desired. The fact that only two young female employees were chosen could be a red flag, especially given the boss's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue and accuses the author of being controlling. The author is acting out of concern for potential impropriety, but maybe overreacting? However, given the boss's history and the specific circumstances, the author's suspicion is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude might be part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is being aware of situations that could lead to conflicts. The author isn't preventing her from going without any reason; he has legitimate red flags. However, the way he's handling it\u2014by refusing her to go without discussing it calmly\u2014might be part of the issue. They need communication, but the author's actions are driven by concern for her safety and the relationship's integrity. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boss's behavior is questionable, and the author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to see the issue is problematic. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
