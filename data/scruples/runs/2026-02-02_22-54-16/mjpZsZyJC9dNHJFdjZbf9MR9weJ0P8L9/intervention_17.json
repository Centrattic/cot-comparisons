I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. The situation has a timeline that shows the fianc\u00e9's growing discomfort as details emerge about the dinner. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the boss is known for being an ambulance chaser and scammer, which immediately raises a red flag. The boss's public persona is questionable, so that's a point in the author's favor. Then, the timeline of events shows that the fianc\u00e9 changed her story multiple times, starting from saying SOs are invited, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people, and the author notices that all attendees are young and female. That's pretty suspicious and makes the author feel like there's something off here.\n\nOn the 18th, the boss insists on sending a car service, even when the author tries to suggest that maybe the fianc\u00e9 should bring the author along. The boss's quick response to change the restaurant at the last minute adds more suspicion. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the issue and even accuses the author of being controlling. She argues that since the boss is married, he wouldn't do anything to affect his marriage. But the author feels that the situation is shady regardless.\n\nSo, the author is trying to protect their relationship and potential marriage by being cautious. The fianc\u00e9 is going to a dinner with a boss who has a questionable reputation, and the circumstances around the dinner (like the car service and the selection of attendees) are making the author very uneasy. The author's reaction seems to stem from genuine concern and a history of red flags. The fianc\u00e9's response of calling them a controlling asshole without considering the evidence might indicate she's in denial or isn't taking the author's concerns seriously. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonably controlling or if they have valid reasons. The timeline and the boss's behavior suggest there's a valid reason to be worried. The author is using evidence from the fianc\u00e9's own communications to show the inconsistencies. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite these concerns could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is being aware of potential problems. The author isn't forbidding the dinner without reason; they've built up their case based on the evolving details provided by the fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about defensiveness than the actual issue. The author's main point is about the shady implications, not just controlling behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns based on the situation and are trying to address them before it escalates. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to listen and the accusation of being controlling seem to be the problematic sides here. So the answer is B.\n"
