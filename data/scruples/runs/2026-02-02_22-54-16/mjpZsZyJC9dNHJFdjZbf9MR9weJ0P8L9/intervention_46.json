I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. The situation seems pretty intense. \n\nFirst, there's a timeline of events. The fianc\u00e9e keeps changing the details about the dinner, which is already a red flag. Then there's the part where the boss insists on sending a car service even after the author suggests she might bring her own ride. The boss's quick response and the way he changes the restaurant at the last minute might indicate he's trying to isolate the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe author is worried because the boss is known for unethical behavior, and the setup of the dinner seems suspicious\u2014only young female employees are invited, the boss is being overly accommodating. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is defensive, calling the author controlling. \n\nThe author's concerns are valid because the situation has elements that could lead to harassment or inappropriate behavior. The boss's actions, like arranging a car service, might be to prevent the fianc\u00e9e from having a ride home, which is a common tactic in harassment cases. The author is trying to protect his partner, which is natural. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems dismissive of the author's valid concerns. By calling him a controlling asshole and doubling down on her decision, she's not addressing the potential risks. The author's frustration is understandable given the context. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concern about a situation that has red flags. It's important to note that the fianc\u00e9e is an adult and has her own agency, but the author's role is to support and protect her, which he's trying to do. \n\nThe key points here are the boss's suspicious behavior, the fianc\u00e9e's dismissiveness, and the author's genuine concerns. The author isn't being controlling without reason; he's reacting to a potentially dangerous scenario. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
