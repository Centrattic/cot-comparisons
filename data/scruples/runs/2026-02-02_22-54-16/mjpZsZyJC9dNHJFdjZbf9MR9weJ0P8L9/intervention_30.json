I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they're upset about their fianc\u00e9 going to dinner with her boss. The author found the whole situation shady because the boss has a questionable reputation, and the setup seems odd\u2014like the car service being insisted upon after the fianc\u00e9 mentioned her partner could drive. The fianc\u00e9, however, is brushing off the concerns and thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works for a firm with a boss known for being a shyster. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially after noticing that only young female employees were invited, and the last-minute car service. The author is trying to protect their partner from a potentially unsafe situation. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 seems dismissive, calling the author controlling and insisting that the boss, who is married, can't do anything that would affect his marriage. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, in a relationship, partners often have concerns about each other's safety and interactions, especially with someone with a questionable reputation. The author is not preventing the fianc\u00e9 from making her own decisions, but is voicing valid concerns based on evidence. The fianc\u00e9, however, is not engaging constructively, labeling the author as controlling instead of discussing the red flags. \n\nThe author's actions seem to be about safety and transparency. They provided evidence of the timeline and the boss's behavior. The fianc\u00e9's response of locking herself in the room and refusing to communicate suggests a breakdown in communication. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable concern. Given the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances of the dinner, the author's concern is justified. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns as controlling might be a deflection. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to protect their partner from potential harm based on valid observations. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about autonomy and possibly the boss's intentions, but the author's role in a relationship is to voice concerns, especially when there's a history of shady behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
