I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 wanting to go to a dinner with her boss, and the author is really upset about it.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The fianc\u00e9 keeps changing the details about the dinner. At first, she says the SOs are invited, then it's just a work party, then only certain people. Then it turns out the invitees are young, female, and the boss insists on a car service. The author is concerned because the boss's behavior seems off\u2014maybe inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author is worried about potential impropriety, especially given the boss's reputation. The boss's actions\u2014like offering a car service when the fianc\u00e9 mentions her partner\u2014could be seen as trying to facilitate a one-on-one meeting. The author is trying to protect his relationship and has valid concerns based on the timeline and the boss's history.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting. She's being invited to a work dinner, which is common in some workplaces. But given the context\u2014boss's shady reputation, the way the invite was handled, and the author's concerns\u2014it's not unreasonable for him to be cautious. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags could be a problem. The author isn't trying to control her but is pointing out potential risks. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is being aware of situations that could lead to problems. The author isn't preventing her from going without any reason. He's basing his concerns on the boss's history and the strange circumstances of the invite. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling him a \"controlling asshole\" might be a defense mechanism if she realizes the potential issues but is still choosing to go. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are valid given the context. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be putting their relationship at risk by ignoring the red flags. The author is trying to communicate his worries and prevent a possible problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
