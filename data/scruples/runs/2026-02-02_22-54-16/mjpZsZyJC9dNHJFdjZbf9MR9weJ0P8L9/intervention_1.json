I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 being invited to dinner with her boss, and the author is upset about it, leading to a major conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm where the boss is known for unethical behavior. The author is concerned because the boss is sending a car to pick her up for a dinner that seems to be a selective celebration. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 gave conflicting information about the event, and eventually, the author suspects something's off. The fianc\u00e9 dismisses his concerns, calling him controlling, and insists on going.\n\nThe author's main issue is the boss's behavior and the potential for inappropriate situations. He's using the timeline of events as evidence that the situation is suspicious. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and wants to attend, possibly putting their relationship at risk.\n\nNow, considering red flags: the boss is older, the invitees are young, female employees, and the boss is making special arrangements (like a car service) after the fianc\u00e9 expresses concern. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the author's valid concerns could be seen as dismissive of his feelings and the potential risks.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe, but there's a pattern here that raises legitimate concerns. The boss's history of being unethical adds to the unease. The author is trying to protect the relationship, which is a reasonable response. The fianc\u00e9's reaction (locking herself in, calling him controlling) suggests defensiveness, possibly because she doesn't want to confront the reality of the situation.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author tried to communicate his concerns with evidence, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't take it seriously. The boss's actions\u2014changing the restaurant at the last minute and providing a car service after the author's concerns\u2014could be seen as manipulative or inappropriate. The author's decision to not let her go could be protective, though it's a tough call.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of not letting her go might come off as controlling, but given the context, it might be justified. The fianc\u00e9 not acknowledging the risks and dismissing his concerns might be the bigger issue here. The author is in a stressful situation, trying to prevent possible harm to their relationship and his fianc\u00e9's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's acting out of concern for the situation's potential risks and his partner's safety, even if his method of handling it is intense. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive and not taking his valid concerns seriously.\n"
