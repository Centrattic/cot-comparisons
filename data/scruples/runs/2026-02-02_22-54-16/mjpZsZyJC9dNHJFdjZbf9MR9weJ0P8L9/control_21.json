I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss, leading to a big argument. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's been with their partner for several years. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being unethical, especially the boss. The boss is organizing a dinner, and the author is really suspicious because the invitees seem to be young, female employees. The boss even arranges a car service, which the author thinks is a red flag. The author tries to stop their fianc\u00e9 from going, leading to an argument where the fianc\u00e9 calls them controlling.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're concerned about the potential for inappropriate behavior, especially given the boss's reputation. The timeline shows changing details about the dinner, which might indicate the boss is trying to be sneaky. The author uses evidence from texts and emails to highlight inconsistencies. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks the author is being overly controlling and doesn't see the problem.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's concern is based on the boss's known shady behavior and the suspicious circumstances of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9 is being invited to a dinner that seems to target young female employees, which raises valid concerns about harassment or inappropriate situations. The author is trying to protect their partner, which is a common concern in a relationship. However, the author is preventing the fianc\u00e9 from attending, which could be seen as controlling if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. But given the context and the boss's history, the author's suspicion is understandable.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction, calling them a controlling asshole, might be an overreaction because she doesn't see the red flags. The author is using evidence to express their concerns, which is reasonable. If the fianc\u00e9 insists on going despite the risks, the author is trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is addressing legitimate concerns. The author isn't acting out of jealousy without cause; they have specific reasons based on the boss's reputation and the dinner's circumstances. It's a balance between respecting autonomy and protecting each other. Since the author is not accusing of infidelity but of unethical behavior, and given the boss's history, the author's actions seem justified as protective rather than controlling. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
