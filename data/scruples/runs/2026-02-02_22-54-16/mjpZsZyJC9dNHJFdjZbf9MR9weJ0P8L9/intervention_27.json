I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. The situation seems pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm that's known for being sketchy, with a boss who has a bad reputation. The boss is taking the whole staff out to celebrate, but the details keep changing. The fianc\u00e9 notices that the invite is only for certain people, specifically young women. Then the boss insists on providing a car service, which makes the author even more suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and wants to go, even after the author laid out the timeline.\n\nThe author is worried about the potential for inappropriate behavior, especially given the boss's reputation. The fianc\u00e9e accuses him of being controlling. But the author's main concern seems to be legitimate, given the situation. The boss's actions\u2014changing plans last minute, providing a car service\u2014could be seen as trying to create a situation where he's alone with these young female employees. That's a red flag.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a possibly predatory situation. Even though they're engaged, it's reasonable to be concerned about such a scenario. The fianc\u00e9e's boss has a history of being an ambulance chaser, which adds to the suspicion. The author is using the timeline and specific incidents to highlight the shady nature of the invitation, which seems like a valid approach.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e, however, doesn't seem to grasp the severity. She's defensive and accuses him of controlling behavior. But the author's actions are based on legitimate concerns, not just jealousy. He's not preventing her from going out per se, but preventing her from entering a situation that could be dangerous or inappropriate given their boss's reputation.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe a bit, but given the circumstances, his concerns are justified. The key point is whether the author's reasons for not wanting her to go are based on valid concerns or if he's being controlling. The evidence he presents (changing plans, targeted invites, car service) supports his suspicion. The boss's quick response when the car service is mentioned is also telling.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and well-being in a situation that's clearly problematic. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be more about feeling controlled, but the author's motivations are reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
