I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 (the author) is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, and he doesn't want her to go. There are some red flags mentioned, like the boss's reputation as a shady lawyer, the last-minute changes to the dinner plans, and the fact that only young female employees are being invited. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about possible ulterior motives from the boss, given the suspicious circumstances. The boss is known for being a scammer, and the dinner invites are changing multiple times, which is odd. The fact that all the invitees are under 30 and female is definitely a red flag. Also, the boss insists on sending a car service even after the author suggests she bring her fianc\u00e9 along, which might be to prevent that.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e seems to think there's nothing wrong. She points out the boss is married and can't risk his marriage, which might be her way of reassuring herself and the author. But maybe she's in denial or doesn't see the problem. The author is frustrated because he's trying to protect her, but she feels controlled.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are trust and communication. The author is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and the reputation of the boss. He's not stopping her from going, but he's expressing his discomfort and the suspicious circumstances. However, he's also making a big deal about it, which might be overreacting if there's no concrete evidence. But given the timeline and the boss's behavior, it's not entirely unfounded.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy. However, when there are legitimate concerns about someone's safety, it's reasonable to express those. The author isn't physically preventing her, just trying to make her see the potential issues. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her independence is being questioned, but the author's intention is protective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. He's raising concerns based on observable red flags. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling him controlling might be a defense mechanism. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
