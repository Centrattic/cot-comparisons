I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is the fianc\u00e9 of someone who works at a law firm with a shady reputation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because their partner is going to a dinner with her boss, which seems suspicious given the timeline and circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially since the dinner was last-minute, only certain people were invited (young women), and the boss offered a car service. These points might indicate that the boss is trying to set up a situation that could be inappropriate. The author is trying to protect their partner and prevent a potential scandal or emotional harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 in question thinks her partner is being controlling and that she's overreacting. She's been invited to a work dinner, which is a common professional event. However, the red flags here are significant: the boss's reputation, the selective invitation list, and the last-minute changes. The author's reaction, while intense, seems to stem from valid concerns about possible misconduct. \n\nThe author tried to communicate their concerns using the evidence from the timeline and direct messages. They didn't act impulsively but built up their concerns over time. The fianc\u00e9's response of calling the author controlling suggests that the author's concerns might not be taken seriously, which could be a problem in their relationship dynamics. However, the author's actions are about protecting their partner from a potentially harmful situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concern and trying to prevent a risky situation. The fianc\u00e9's boss has a questionable reputation, and the circumstances around the dinner are suspicious. The author's frustration and need to address these issues are understandable. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on attending despite these red flags could be seen as dismissing valid concerns. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (Answer B). Their concerns are justified given the context, and they're acting in what they believe is their partner's best interest.\n"
