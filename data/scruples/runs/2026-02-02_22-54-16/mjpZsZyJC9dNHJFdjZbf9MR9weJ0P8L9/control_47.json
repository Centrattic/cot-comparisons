I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to attend a dinner with her boss. The key points to consider here are the red flags in the boss's behavior, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about potential inappropriate situations, and the communication between the couple.\n\nFirst, the boss is described as someone with a shady reputation, known for his aggressive marketing tactics. The timing and exclusivity of the dinner invitation seem suspicious. The boss initially said spouses were invited, then changed to a work party, then narrowed it down to specific employees. The fact that the invitees are all young, female, and under 30 raises eyebrows. The boss offering a car service instead of allowing the fianc\u00e9 to drive adds to the suspicion. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue and is pushing to go, even calling the author controlling. The author is trying to protect their relationship by being cautious, using the evidence from the timeline to support their concerns. The fianc\u00e9's own comment that the boss can't do anything affecting his marriage suggests she might also feel something's off, but she's not acknowledging the risks.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is being able to voice concerns without being dismissed as controlling. The author isn't forbidding the dinner without reason; they have a pattern of questionable behavior from the boss. The fianc\u00e9, however, isn't addressing these concerns and is instead defensive, which complicates things. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's concerns are reasonable given the circumstances. Since there are multiple red flags and the author is trying to communicate these, it's a matter of valid concern rather than being controlling. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not wanting to admit the boss's behavior is problematic, or maybe she's in denial. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having these concerns. It's about protecting the relationship from potential issues. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of his worries and her insistence on going despite the red flags might indicate deeper issues in their communication. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
