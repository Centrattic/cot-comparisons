I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to go to dinner with her boss, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a fianc\u00e9 whose partner works at a law firm with a shady reputation. The boss, who's known for being a bit of a con artist, is hosting a dinner to celebrate the company's best year. The fianc\u00e9 has noticed some red flags: the event was initially said to include spouses, then changed to just a work party, then narrowed down to only young female employees. The boss insists on sending a car service, which makes the author suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about the potential for inappropriate situations and doesn't want their partner to go. The partner is upset, calling the author controlling, but the author feels justified due to the suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the author's concerns are reasonable. The key points here are the boss's reputation, the changing details of the event, the selection of attendees, and the boss's behavior with the car service. The author is concerned about possible impropriety and is trying to protect their partner. The partner, however, sees the author as overreacting.\n\nIn terms of relationships, trust is important, but so is being aware of potential risks. The boss's history as a \"shyster\" and the way the dinner is set up (only young women, last-minute car service) are legitimate concerns. The author isn't just being paranoid; there are specific details that point to something being off. The partner, on the other hand, might be dismissing these concerns, possibly because she doesn't see the same red flags or doesn't want to confront them.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by refusing to let her go. In a healthy relationship, both partners should discuss their concerns and come to a mutual decision. However, the author's actions of presenting the timeline and evidence could be seen as trying to prevent a problematic situation, not just controlling behavior. The employer's insistence on the car service after the fianc\u00e9 volunteers to drive adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe partner's reaction of calling the author a \"controlling asshole\" might be a deflection. The author's main issue is the potential risk involved, not controlling behavior per se. The partner's argument that the boss is married and can't do anything might be a way to reassure herself, but the author is pointing out that even married men can act inappropriately, which is a valid point.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's concerns are reasonable given the context. The boss's behavior and the circumstances of the dinner create a situation that's ripe for impropriety. The author is acting to protect their partner from a potentially dangerous or uncomfortable situation, which is a responsible action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
