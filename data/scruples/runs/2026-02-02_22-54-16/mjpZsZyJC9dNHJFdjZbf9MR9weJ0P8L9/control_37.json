I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their fianc\u00e9 attending a dinner with her boss. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm known for questionable practices. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which gives some context about the firm's reputation. The author is concerned because the boss is inviting his fianc\u00e9 and another female employee to dinner, with the boss offering a car service. The timeline shows inconsistencies in the event's details, which the author finds suspicious.\n\nThe author's main concerns are about the potential for inappropriate situations. The boss is married, and the author fears that being alone with him could lead to issues. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't share these concerns and sees the situation as normal. The author feels it's wrong to go, while the fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. The author has valid reasons to be worried given the boss's reputation and the odd circumstances of the event. The fianc\u00e9 being chosen over others (young, female) adds to the suspicion. The author isn't acting out of jealousy but from a place of concern for potential ethical issues and the firm's shady practices.\n\nHowever, the author needs to consider their approach. While their concerns are understandable, they should discuss openly with their fianc\u00e9 instead of unilaterally deciding she can't go. But given the circumstances\u2014like the boss's history and the suspicious setup\u2014it's reasonable to be cautious. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns as controlling might be a sign she's not taking the situation seriously.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having these concerns. The key points are the suspicious behavior from the employer's side and the author's attempt to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author's intentions are protective. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
