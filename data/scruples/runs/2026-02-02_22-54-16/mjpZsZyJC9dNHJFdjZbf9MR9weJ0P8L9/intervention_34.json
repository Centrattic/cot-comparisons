I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting the other to go to a dinner with her boss. So, the author is the fianc\u00e9's partner, right? They've been together for years, and the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that has a reputation. The boss is known for being shady, and there's this dinner where the author is concerned about possible inappropriate situations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is worried because the boss is sending a car service for the fianc\u00e9, and the invitees are mostly young women. The timelines show that the fianc\u00e9 changed the details multiple times, which might have raised red flags. The author thinks it's a bad idea and refuses to let her go, leading to an argument where the fianc\u00e9 calls the author controlling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider factors like controlling behavior, trust in the relationship, and whether the author has valid concerns.\n\nOn one hand, the author has legitimate reasons to be concerned. The boss's reputation, the suspicious changes in the event details, and the fact that the boss insists on a car service when the fianc\u00e9 tries to bring her partner could indicate something inappropriate. The author is trying to protect the relationship by not letting her go, which might be seen as overprotective but not entirely unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping. Relationships require trust, and by not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to go, the author could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014calling the author an asshole and wanting to go more\u2014suggests that she feels her autonomy is being violated. There's also the aspect of communication; maybe the author should have expressed concerns earlier and discussed boundaries rather than making a last-minute decision to prevent her from attending.\n\nAnother angle is the fianc\u00e9's role. If she's aware of the boss's reputation and the odd circumstances but still insists on going, that might indicate she's not as concerned as the author. However, it's also possible she's unaware of the potential risks and the author is trying to alert her. The key here is whether the author's actions were based on valid concerns or personal jealousy.\n\nIn terms of controlling behavior, the line is thin. If the author is acting out of genuine concern for safety and the firm's ethics, it's justified. But if it's about control over her social interactions without her consent, that's problematic. The author's approach\u2014using texts and emails as evidence and then forbidding her to go\u2014might come off as controlling, especially if he didn't discuss it with her earlier.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The author's concerns are valid given the context, but the way he handled it (threatening to break things off, acting unilaterally) could be seen as overstepping. The fianc\u00e9's response also shows that she feels her autonomy is being respected, which is important in a healthy relationship. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to be at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong at all. Given the situation, the author's intentions might mitigate his actions, but the method of handling it could be an issue. But considering the boss's shady reputation and the suspicious circumstances, the author's caution is understandable. So, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking the controlling aspect.\n"
