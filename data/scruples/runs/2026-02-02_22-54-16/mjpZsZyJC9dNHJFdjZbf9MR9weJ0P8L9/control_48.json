I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her partner to go to a dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's been in a relationship for years. His fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a boss who has a shady reputation. The boss is organizing a dinner to celebrate the firm's best year ever. The fianc\u00e9 notices several red flags: the event is initially said to include spouses, then changes to a work party, then only certain employees are invited. The invitees are all young women under 30, and the boss offers a car service on the day, which makes the author suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 tries to stop her, but she calls him controlling. \n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author overstepping by not letting his fianc\u00e9 go to the dinner? The author is acting out of concern for her safety and potential inappropriate situations. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels her autonomy is being\u4fb5\u72af. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author is expressing valid concerns based on the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being controlling without concrete evidence. \n\nBut considering the timeline and the boss's behavior\u2014changing plans, selective invitations, the last-minute car service\u2014it's reasonable for the author to be worried. The fianc\u00e9's boss is known for unethical practices, which adds to the concern. The author isn't just being paranoid; he's pointing out patterns that suggest the dinner might not be professional.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her autonomy is being undermined. However, in a healthy relationship, discussing concerns and making decisions together is important. The author did present his case with evidence from her own messages, which shows he's not acting without reason. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014calling him controlling and locking herself in\u2014might indicate she's defensive. But the author's actions are rooted in protecting her from a potentially risky situation. Even if the dinner was innocent, the boss's actions are questionable, and the author has a right to be concerned.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. He's acting in good faith to protect his fianc\u00e9, based on legitimate concerns. The answer should be B.\n"
