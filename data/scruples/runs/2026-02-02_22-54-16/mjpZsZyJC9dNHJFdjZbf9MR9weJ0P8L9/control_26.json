I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 being upset that his fianc\u00e9e wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The key points here are the timeline and the red flags that the author mentions.\n\nFirst, the boss is described as a shady character, someone known for being an ambulance chaser. The author has met him and feels uncomfortable around him. Then, the boss's invitation to the dinner seems to change multiple times. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e says the author's presence is okay, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people. The author notices that all the invitees are young women under 30, which raises concerns. Then, the boss insists on sending a car, which seems like an attempt to keep them separate from their partners. The fianc\u00e9e dismisses these concerns as the author being controlling.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, there are multiple red flags. The boss's behavior could be predatory, especially given his reputation. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the same risks and feels that her fianc\u00e9 is overreacting. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author is expressing concern based on concrete observations and past experiences with the boss. He's not trying to control her but is pointing out the inconsistencies and potential dangers. The fianc\u00e9e accuses him of being controlling, but the author's actions are more about safety and trust. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author had made assumptions without discussing his concerns openly, that could be an issue. But in this case, he's presented a timeline and specific examples of the boss's behavior. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to acknowledge these concerns and her reaction might indicate that she's not taking the author's valid worries seriously. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to protect his partner from a potentially risky situation. The boss's actions\u2014changing the event details, arranging a car service\u2014raise legitimate concerns about his intentions. The author isn't preventing her from working or socializing for no reason; he has valid reasons based on the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of these concerns as controlling behavior might be her way of downplaying the actual issues. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are justified, and it's reasonable to be cautious when a boss exhibits such behavior towards employees, especially when it seems to target young female staff. The fianc\u00e9e's insistence on attending despite these red flags could be the real issue here.\n"
