I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. So, the user is asking if the author is an asshole here (AITA).\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss is the founder of a law firm that has a reputation for being unethical (like ambulance chasers). The fianc\u00e9e initially thought the fianc\u00e9 was invited, then later it's clear it's just a work dinner for select employees. Then, the fianc\u00e9e reveals that the boss is sending a car service, which makes the fianc\u00e9 suspicious because he notices that only young female employees are being invited. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't seem to see the problem, and the fianc\u00e9 is now threatening to break off the engagement because he doesn't want her to go.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the boss's intentions due to his reputation and the way the dinner is set up (only young women, last-minute car service). The fianc\u00e9e is frustrated that her partner is being controlling and not trusting her.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He has legitimate concerns. The boss has a shady reputation, the dinner is exclusive, and the way the car service is arranged seems a bit suspicious. The fact that only young female employees are invited could be a red flag. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially uncomfortable or dangerous situation. His actions are based on these concerns, and he's using the evidence he's gathered over time to justify his stance. He's not just being paranoid; there are specific patterns that raise red flags.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9e's side: She might feel that her partner is being overbearing and not trusting her. She's confident that the situation is okay, especially since the boss is married and she's not doing anything wrong. She might see his concerns as unnecessary and controlling, especially since she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions. She might also feel that he's undermining her professionalism by questioning her role in the company's success.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If the author has valid reasons to be concerned, he's not entirely in the wrong. However, the way he's handling it might be problematic. Yelling, controlling behavior, and threatening to break off the engagement over this might be seen as extreme. On the other hand, if the author's concerns are legitimate, he's justified in being worried. The fianc\u00e9e might be dismissive of his valid concerns, which could also be an issue.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If there's a legitimate reason to be concerned (like a boss with a bad reputation, exclusive dinners with young female employees, and a car service that seems to prevent the fianc\u00e9e from being with her partner), then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if there's no evidence of wrongdoing beyond his suspicions, then he might be overreacting.\n\nBut in this case, the author presents a timeline of events that show the boss's behavior is suspicious. The boss's quick response and the change in plans could indicate something improper. The author's concerns are based on observable facts, not just jealousy. So, while his reaction is intense, the concerns themselves are valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concerns are based on legitimate red flags, even if his approach could be better. The fianc\u00e9e might be dismissing his valid concerns, and the situation does have elements that suggest potential issues.\n"
