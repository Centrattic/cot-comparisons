I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who is really frustrated because their fianc\u00e9 wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a shady lawyer known for ambulance-chasing, and the dinner seems to be a last-minute change where the boss offers a car service. The author is worried about the implications of this dinner, especially since the boss has been making several changes to the event, including changing the guest list to only include young female employees. The fianc\u00e9 is defensive, calling the author controlling, and the author is considering breaking off the relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's main concern is about the appropriateness of the fianc\u00e9 attending a dinner with her boss, especially given the boss's reputation and the unusual circumstances of the event. The timeline shows that the boss initially invited fianc\u00e9s, then changed his mind, then adjusted the guest list, and finally insisted on a car service. The author is uncomfortable with this and is trying to prevent the dinner, while the fianc\u00e9 is insistent on going.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author's suspicion might be based on the boss's reputation and the way the event was organized. The boss's actions could be seen as trying to create a situation where he's alone with young, possibly vulnerable employees. The author is acting on these concerns, which are valid in the sense that there's a potential for inappropriate behavior, especially with a boss who has a history of questionable tactics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making assumptions about the boss's intentions without concrete evidence. The fianc\u00e9 has been given permission to attend, and the boss might have genuine reasons for wanting to celebrate with a select group of employees. The author's reaction could be overbearing if there's no actual proof of wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being too controlling, especially if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions without evidence of misconduct.\n\nBut wait, the boss's quick response to send a car service when the author's fianc\u00e9 tried to bring her partner suggests possible ulterior motives. Normally, if it's just a celebration, the boss wouldn't mind if the employee brought a partner. The fact that he immediately changed the restaurant when the author suggested that the fianc\u00e9 bring him implies that he might not want the employee to be accompanied. This could be a red flag indicating that the dinner isn't just a professional event.\n\nThe author is using the timeline of events as evidence to support their concerns. Even though there's no direct proof of the boss's intentions, the pattern of behavior is suspicious. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of locking herself in the room and calling the author controlling might indicate that she's defensive because she sees the potential issue too, but is unwilling to back down. The author's refusal to go without evidence is a reasonable precaution to avoid a risky situation, even if they might be wrong.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is safety and judgment, especially when it comes to interactions that have the potential for impropriety. The author is not being unreasonable in his concerns given the circumstances. The boss's behavior is at least questionable, and the author is trying to protect the relationship by addressing these issues. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on attending despite the red flags could be seen as dismissive of the author's valid concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't being controlling without cause. The situation is set up in a way that's professionally suspect, and the author is acting on that. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to go, even after the boss's odd behavior, might be where the fault lies. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
