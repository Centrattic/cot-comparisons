I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 (the author) is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as someone with a shady reputation, and there are some red flags that the author notices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: the plans for the dinner keep changing. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e says the author should keep the date open because the boss is inviting the SOs. Then she corrects herself, saying it's just a work party and the author can make other plans. Then it's narrowed down to only certain people, and finally, the boss insists on sending a car service, which seems odd. The author is worried that the boss might be trying to get the fianc\u00e9e alone, given that all the attendees are young women and the boss's history.\n\nThe author is expressing valid concerns based on the behavior of the boss. The boss's actions, like changing the plans last minute and providing a car service, could be seen as attempts to create a private situation. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't seem to see the problem and is defensive, even calling the author controlling. \n\nBut where's the line here? The author is voicing his concerns as a partner, which is understandable. However, if the fianc\u00e9e feels that her partner is overstepping, there's a conflict there. But given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances, the author's caution makes sense. The key here is whether the author's concerns are reasonable. The boss's behavior does raise red flags, and the author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her partner is being too controlling. But the author isn't preventing her from going; he's just not okay with her attending given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's response of wanting to go more than ever might be a reaction to feeling controlled, but the author's concerns are based on actual suspicious behavior.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain his reasoning, but the fianc\u00e9e dismissed his concerns. However, the author isn't wrong for being concerned about her safety and the potential for inappropriate behavior, especially with a boss known for shady dealings. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e herself acknowledges the boss is married and can't risk his marriage might indicate she's aware of the potential issues but is choosing to ignore them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's concerns are valid. He's acting out of concern for his partner's safety and well-being. Therefore, he's not in the wrong here.\n"
