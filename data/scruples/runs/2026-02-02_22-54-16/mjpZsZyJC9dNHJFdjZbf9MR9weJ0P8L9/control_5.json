I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's go through the situation step by step. The author is the fianc\u00e9 whose partner is planning to go to a dinner with her boss. The main question is whether the author is being unreasonable by not wanting her to go, or if the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping.\n\nFirst, let's look at the timeline. The fianc\u00e9 initially thought the boss was inviting partners, but it turned out to be a select group. The boss is described as someone with a shady reputation, and the fact that only young female employees are invited raises concerns. The boss insists on sending a car service, which seems odd, and the fianc\u00e9 is worried about possible impropriety.\n\nThe author is clearly worried about the implications of the dinner. The boss's behavior\u2014offering a car service when the fianc\u00e9 wants to pick up her partner\u2014could be seen as trying to prevent the partner from accompanying her, which is suspicious. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is insistent on going, even calling the author controlling.\n\nNow, considering the context: the boss's reputation is questionable. The circumstances of the dinner\u2014only young female employees, last-minute changes, the car service\u2014add to the red flags. The author is voicing legitimate concerns about potential harassment or inappropriate situations, which is a valid reason for concern. On the other hand, the author is not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to make her own decisions, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a relationship, partners are allowed to express concerns about each other's safety and well-being. If there are clear red flags, especially from someone with a shady background, the author's worries aren't baseless. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns and insistence on going despite the suspicious circumstances might indicate that the author has a valid point.\n\nHowever, the author is also using evidence and pointing out the timeline, which the fianc\u00e9 calls \"hoarding evidence.\" That suggests the author is being overly controlling. But in this case, the evidence seems to support the author's concerns. The line between being overprotective and being cautious is thin. The key is whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9's autonomy while voicing concerns.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that the boss is married and can't do anything is a bit of a red herring. Just because someone is married doesn't mean they won't act inappropriately. The author's main issue is the situation's potential for impropriety, which is a valid concern regardless of the boss's marital status.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being concerned. The situation has multiple red flags, and expressing those concerns is reasonable. However, the way the author is handling it\u2014refusing to let the fianc\u00e9 go without a fight\u2014might cross into controlling behavior. But given the context, the author's actions seem more like protective and concerned rather than controlling. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
