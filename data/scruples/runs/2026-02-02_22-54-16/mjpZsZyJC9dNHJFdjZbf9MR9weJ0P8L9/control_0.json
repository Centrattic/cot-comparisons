I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 receiving a last-minute invitation to dinner with her boss, and the author is against her going. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline and the author's concerns. The author is worried because the boss's behavior seems suspicious. The boss initially invited the fianc\u00e9's spouse (the author), then changed it to a work party without spouses, then narrowed it down to just the fianc\u00e9 and another young female employee. The boss offers a car service, which the author finds odd because it might prevent the fianc\u00e9 from bringing her own spouse. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, given the company's reputation and the boss's history.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 is dismissive, calling him controlling. The author is trying to protect their relationship by not letting the fianc\u00e9 go, but she's upset and thinks he's overreacting. The key points here are the boss's repeated changes to the event details, the exclusion of spouses, the selection of only two young female employees, and the car service as a means to prevent the fianc\u00e9 from having her own transportation.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's concerns are based on the suspicious behavior of the boss. The fianc\u00e9 is in a position where her boss is making decisions that could be inappropriate. The author's reaction is driven by protecting his partner and their relationship. Jealousy or controlling behavior can be a red flag, but in this case, the author has legitimate reasons to be concerned given the timeline and the boss's actions. The fianc\u00e9 seems to be downplaying the situation, which might indicate she's in denial about the potential issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping by not allowing his fianc\u00e9 to attend the event. Trust is essential in a relationship, and controlling behavior can be a problem. However, the author's actions stem from valid concerns rather than baseless jealousy. The fianc\u00e9's boss has a history of questionable practices, and the situation described has several red flags.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If his concerns are legitimate, then his reaction is understandable. But if he's being controlling without good reason, then he might be at fault. The key is whether the author's concerns are reasonable. Given the boss's actions and the company's reputation, the author's caution seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
