I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e going to dinner with her boss, and the author is upset about it. I need to analyze the situation and decide if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the boss's intentions. The boss is described as someone with a shady reputation\u2014part of a law firm that does DUI charges and is known as an ambulance chaser. The boss has sent conflicting information about the dinner, first saying spouses are invited, then changing it to a work party, then narrowing it down to specific people. The timing and the way he offers a car service after the fianc\u00e9e mentions the author knowing the restaurant might be a red flag.\n\nThe author is worried that the boss might be trying to create a situation where he can be alone with the fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e, however, doesn't see the issue and is upset that the author is stopping her from going. She accuses him of being controlling. The author has a history of the fianc\u00e9e being vague about the dinner details, changing them multiple times, and now the boss is accommodating her in a way that excludes the author.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing concern about a potentially inappropriate situation. He's pointing out inconsistencies and possible motives, which could be reasonable. On the other hand, if he's preventing her from going without clear evidence, that could be overstepping. But given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances (like the car service), the author's concern isn't entirely unfounded. His fianc\u00e9e's insistence on going despite these issues might make her at fault, but the question is about the author.\n\nThe key factors are the boss's shady background, the changing plans, and the author's reasonable caution. The author isn't necessarily wrong to be concerned. He's trying to protect the relationship from a risky situation. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction and dismissal of his concerns might be her fault, but the author's actions are based on valid suspicions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
