I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to a dinner with her boss. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, looking at the timeline: the boss keeps changing the details about the dinner. Initially, it's a staff celebration with SOs, then it becomes a work party without the fianc\u00e9, then the invitees are under 30 and female. On the day, the boss insists on providing a car, even when the fianc\u00e9 suggests bringing their own. The fianc\u00e9 is clearly concerned about the situation, especially since the boss has a shady reputation. The fianc\u00e9's partner is frustrated and thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nNow, the key points here are the red flags. The boss's company is known for unethical practices, and the dinner setup seems suspicious. The boss is making last-minute changes and ensuring the fianc\u00e9 can't attend, which raises concerns about possible inappropriate behavior. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect their partner from a situation that could lead to harassment or exploitation, especially given the boss's character. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014being upset and trying to prevent the dinner\u2014is based on these red flags. The fianc\u00e9's partner, however, doesn't see the issue and is upset about being called a controlling asshole. The author is using evidence from the timeline to back their claims, not acting out of jealousy without reason.\n\nSo, the author is justified in their concerns. The boss's actions are sketchy, and the fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect their partner from a potentially harmful situation. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're responding to clear warning signs. The key here is the context of the boss's history and the unusual circumstances of the dinner. The author's actions are protective, not controlling, given the situation.\n"
