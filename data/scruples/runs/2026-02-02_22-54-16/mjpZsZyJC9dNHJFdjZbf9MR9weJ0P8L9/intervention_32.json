I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, especially the boss. The author is concerned because there's a pattern here. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details about the dinner. Initially, it was a staff celebration, then a work party, then it became clear it's only certain people. The key point is that the two people invited are both young women. Plus, the boss insists on sending a car service, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to notice anything wrong and is pushing to go anyway.\n\nThe author is worried about potential inappropriate situations. The boss is married, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can't act inappropriately. The author's concerns seem reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 is dismissing the author's concerns as controlling, but the author is trying to protect the relationship. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has valid reasons based on the suspicious circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 is going against the author's wishes, which is causing a major conflict. The author isn't being controlling out of nowhere; there's evidence of the boss's questionable behavior and the odd setup of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9's response, calling the author a controlling asshole, might be her way of dealing with the stress, but it doesn't negate the author's concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to attend work events. However, the author's job is in a firm with a shady reputation, which adds to the suspicion. The key here is whether the author overreacted. The timeline and the boss's insistence on a car service could be a red flag. The author isn't acting out of jealousy without cause but is trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on valid concerns and trying to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of those concerns as controlling might be unfounded. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
