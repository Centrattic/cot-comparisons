I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her partner to go to a dinner with her boss. The key points to consider are the timeline, the boss's behavior, and the fianc\u00e9's reactions.\n\nFirst, the boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which is a negative term implying unethical behavior. The author is concerned about the boss's reputation, which is a legitimate concern. The timeline shows multiple changes in the event's nature and attendees. The author points out that the attendees are young and female, which raises red flags about potential inappropriate behavior. The boss insists on sending a car service, even when the fianc\u00e9 suggests her partner could drive, which seems controlling or possibly predatory.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on these red flags. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is pushing to attend. The author is acting out of concern for her safety, which is a valid reason for concern. The fianc\u00e9 accuses him of being controlling, but the situation's context suggests the author's caution is justified. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the fianc\u00e9's autonomy. The author has a right to be concerned, but he also needs to communicate his concerns without being overly controlling. The way he presented his evidence (texts, timeline) is reasonable for expressing his worries. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to listen and her reaction might indicate that the author's approach could be more diplomatic, but given the boss's history and the specific incidents, the author's stance isn't baseless.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his concerns are based on legitimate red flags. However, the situation also requires mutual understanding and communication. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on attending despite the risks could be problematic. The answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong) because his concerns are valid and his actions are protective, though the communication could be better.\n"
