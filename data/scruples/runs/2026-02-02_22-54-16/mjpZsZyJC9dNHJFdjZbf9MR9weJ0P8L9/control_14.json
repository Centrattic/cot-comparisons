I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who's upset that his fianc\u00e9e wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is the fianc\u00e9, and he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not wanting her to go.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details he provided. The boss is the founder of a law firm that's known for ambulance-chasing, and there's some shady reputation there. The author feels uncomfortable around this boss. The fianc\u00e9e initially said the fianc\u00e9 could come along, then changed her mind, then it turned out only certain people were invited\u2014specifically young women. The boss then insists on sending a car, even changing the restaurant, which makes the author even more suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the problem and wants to go, leading to a big argument where she accuses him of being controlling. The author is now considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for not wanting her to go? Well, the author is concerned about the potential for inappropriate situations. The boss is older, and the invitees are young female employees. The boss's actions, like offering a car service after the fianc\u00e9e says she can't drive, might suggest he's trying to create a situation where they are alone or under his control. The author's timeline and the way the invitations were handled seem to indicate possible manipulation or inappropriate intentions from the boss.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the same red flags. She might feel that her partner is being overly controlling or not trusting her. But given the boss's history and the specific circumstances\u2014only young women invited, last-minute changes, the push for car service\u2014it's reasonable for the author to be concerned. The fianc\u00e9e's own comment about the boss being \"married\" and not doing anything to affect his marriage shows she does recognize some implications, but she's dismissing the author's concerns.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is safety. If there's a legitimate reason to believe the boss might act inappropriately, the author has a right to be concerned. The fact that the situation has multiple red flags (shady company reputation, selective invitations, forced car service) supports the author's perspective. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction could be due to feeling accused without evidence, but the author is acting to protect her from a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns and trying to prevent his fianc\u00e9e from being in a compromising position. The issue might be more about communication\u2014maybe he should have discussed it calmly rather than forbidding her outright\u2014but his intentions are protective. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
