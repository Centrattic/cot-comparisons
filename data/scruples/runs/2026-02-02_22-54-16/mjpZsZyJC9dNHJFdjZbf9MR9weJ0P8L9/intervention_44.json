I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is the fianc\u00e9's partner, and they're getting really frustrated because the boss's behavior seems shady, especially with the way the dinner invitations are being handled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and the events. The boss is sending a car, changing plans last minute, and only certain people are invited. The fianc\u00e9 seems to be aware that the boss is a problematic character, given his reputation. The author is worried about potential predatory behavior, especially since the invitees are young women. The fianc\u00e9, however, is downplaying the concerns, saying the boss is married and can't affect his marriage, which is a bit of a red flag in itself. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they feel the situation is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. They've tried to communicate their concerns based on the timeline and evidence. The fianc\u00e9 is pushing back, calling the author controlling. But the author's concerns are valid because of the boss's history and the way the dinner is being arranged. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's normal to have concerns about a partner interacting in a way that could lead to issues, especially with someone known for unethical behavior. The author isn't preventing her from going for no reason; there are actual red flags. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite these concerns might be a bigger issue. \n\nAlso, the author isn't being overly controlling without cause. They're acting on real evidence and reasonable fears. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive, which could indicate a bigger problem in their communication or trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to protect their partner from a potentially risky situation. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be underestimating the danger. So the answer should be B.\n"
