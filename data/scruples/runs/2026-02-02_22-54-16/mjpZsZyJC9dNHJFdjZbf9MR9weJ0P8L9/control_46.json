I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 going to dinner with her boss, and the author is really upset about it. I need to figure out whether the author is being unreasonable or if there's a valid concern here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the timeline. The fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details about the dinner. Initially, it was a staff event with SOs, then it became a work party where the author could make other plans, then it was narrowed down to only certain people. Then, on the day, the boss insists on sending a car service, which seems odd. The author is worried there might be inappropriate intentions, especially since the attendees are all young, female, and the boss has a shady reputation. \n\nThe author's concerns aren't baseless. The boss is known for being a scammer, and the way the dinner was arranged\u2014last-minute changes, insisting on a car service\u2014could be red flags. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing concern based on the behavior he's observed. It's natural for a partner to feel uneasy when there are inconsistencies and potential risks. The fianc\u00e9 being defensive and calling him controlling might suggest that the author isn't entirely wrong to be cautious. However, maybe the author overreacted? But considering the pattern of the boss's behavior and the way the dinner was set up, his concerns are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being overly suspicious without concrete evidence. But given the context\u2014the boss's reputation, the suspicious setup\u2014it's not just paranoia. The author isn't preventing her from going without a reason. He's pointing out the inconsistencies and potential risks. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He's justified in his concerns based on the evidence presented. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior is questionable, and the author's reaction is a protective measure. The fianc\u00e9 dismissing his concerns as controlling might be the real issue here. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's trying to protect his relationship and his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially problematic situation.\n"
