I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's upset because their partner wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The boss is known as a shady character, and the way the invitations have been handled seems suspicious. The timeline shows that the boss's plans have changed multiple times, and the fact that the dinner is only for young female employees raises red flags. The author is worried about the potential for misconduct, especially since the boss is married, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't seeing the same concerns. The fianc\u00e9 even called the author controlling, and now there's a standoff.\n\nFirst, I should consider if the author has valid reasons for concern. The boss's reputation as a scammer and ambulance chaser is a real issue. The author met him and felt uncomfortable. The dinner invitation being exclusively for young women under 30 is definitely a red flag. It's a situation where there's a power dynamic, as the boss is in a position of authority at work. The author's fianc\u00e9 was told she can't drive herself and has to take the car service, which seems like an attempt to control her movement or create a more private setting.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is dismissing the author's concerns. She's proud of being invited, which might indicate she's unaware of the implications or is downplaying them. The author is trying to protect his partner, which is a natural reaction in a relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is being controlling. The key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable or overstepping.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author has tried to present the timeline and evidence, but the fianc\u00e9 is not taking it seriously. The author's frustration is understandable given the suspicious circumstances. The fact that the boss is married and the author's fianc\u00e9 is a recent graduate might make the situation even more precarious, as the boss could potentially use his position to favor her, which could lead to issues at work if she's in a vulnerable position.\n\nHowever, the author might also be overreacting if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. The boss could have legitimate reasons for the dinner, like celebrating the company's success. But the pattern of the invitations and the car service does point towards possible ulterior motives. The author is acting out of concern for his partner's safety and the potential for a compromising situation. \n\nIn such cases, it's about balancing the right to privacy and autonomy with the need for protection. The author's role as a partner is to support and protect, but it's also about respecting the fianc\u00e9's ability to make her own decisions. However, when there's a clear power imbalance and potential for exploitation, the partner's concern might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is acting out of care and trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns might be because she doesn't see the danger, but that doesn't make the author wrong in expressing them. The key is whether the author is being reasonable. The facts presented do support the author's concerns, so I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
