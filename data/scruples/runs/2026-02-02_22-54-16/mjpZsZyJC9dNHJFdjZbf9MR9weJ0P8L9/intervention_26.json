I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to attend a dinner with her boss. The situation seems complex with a lot of red flags.\n\nFirst, the timeline is important. The fianc\u00e9 initially thought the boss was inviting partners, then it became a work party, and then it's narrowed down to two young female employees. The boss offers a car service, which raises eyebrows because it seems like he's trying to ensure they don't have to drive, possibly to be alone with them. The fianc\u00e9 is rightfully concerned about the implications here. The boss's quick response and the fact that he changes the restaurant at the last minute if they mention not taking the car service is suspicious. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9 has presented a clear timeline of events that show inconsistencies and potential ulterior motives. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect their partner from a situation that could be inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are not just about jealousy but about possible predatory behavior from the boss. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reactions, while intense (like being ready to break off the relationship), stem from valid concerns. The fianc\u00e9 isn't just being controlling; they're pointing out red flags that even the fianc\u00e9 acknowledges when she mentions the boss's marital status. The fianc\u00e9 is acting out of concern for safety and respect, which are legitimate reasons. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's approach might come off as controlling. However, given the circumstances, the fianc\u00e9's actions are more about protecting their partner from a potentially harmful situation. The fianc\u00e9 is using evidence (texts, emails) to support their argument, which shows they are trying to be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's emotional response is also a result of being in a high-stress situation where they feel their partner is in danger.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's partner, meanwhile, seems to be downplaying the situation, possibly because she doesn't see the same red flags. Her reaction of calling the author a controlling asshole might be defensive because she's under pressure. However, her willingness to go despite the fianc\u00e9's concerns might indicate she's not recognizing the risks. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's important to respect boundaries in relationships, the fianc\u00e9's concerns here are about safety and inappropriate workplace behavior. The author is not in the wrong for being concerned about these red flags. The key issue is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. While the author's response is intense, the underlying reasons are valid. The author is trying to address potential issues before they escalate, which is a responsible approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are acting out of concern for their partner's safety and the integrity of the relationship, especially given the suspicious circumstances surrounding the boss's invitation.\n"
