I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for ambulance-chasing, and the boss has a bad reputation. The author is uncomfortable with this from the start. Then, the boss starts changing the details of the dinner: initially saying spouses are invited, then it's a work party, then only certain people are selected. The author notices that the invitees are all young women under 30, which raises red flags. The boss even arranges a car service, which the author sees as suspicious because it might be to prevent the employee from having a sober ride home. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see anything wrong and wants to go, calling the author controlling. \n\nNow, the author is worried that the boss might take advantage of her, given the boss's shady reputation and the way the dinner is being set up. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the boss is married and can't do anything, but that seems like a weak justification. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially dangerous situation. The boss's behavior\u2014changing plans, providing a car service\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The fianc\u00e9's boss being in a position of power adds to the concern about any potential coercion or inappropriate advances.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being overly controlling. She might believe that she can handle herself and that the author is not respecting her autonomy. However, given the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances, the author's concerns are understandable. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is safety. If there are legitimate red flags (like a boss with a bad reputation, last-minute changes to plans, and exclusive invitees), it's reasonable for the partner to be concerned. The author isn't just being paranoid; he's reacting to a series of events that could indicate a problematic situation. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014calling him controlling and wanting to go despite his concerns\u2014might indicate that she's either not recognizing the risks or is prioritizing her job over her partner's feelings. In this case, the author is trying to prevent a situation that could lead to emotional or even physical harm, which isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are valid given the context, and he's acting to protect his fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior and the circumstances surrounding the dinner are suspicious enough to warrant the author's anxiety. Therefore, the answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
