I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his girlfriend to go to a dinner with her boss, and their argument has escalated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm with a boss who has a shady reputation. The boss invited her to a dinner, initially saying spouses could come, then changing to a work party, then narrowing it down to certain employees. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned because the invitees are young, female, and the boss offers a car service last minute. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about possible inappropriate situations, but the fianc\u00e9e thinks he's being controlling.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the fianc\u00e9 overreacting and being controlling, or is he justified in his concerns? The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the red flags here. The boss's history as an ambulance chaser, the changing details about the dinner, the last-minute car service which could be a way to isolate her. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially uncomfortable or dangerous situation. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels her autonomy is being questioned, which can lead to tension. \n\nIs the fianc\u00e9 being controlling by not letting her go? If he's blocking her without a valid reason, that's controlling. But if his concerns are based on real red flags and he's trying to protect her, maybe not. The boss's behavior might be questionable, especially the car service offer after the fianc\u00e9e's partner says he can drive. That seems like a way to ensure the boss has time alone with her.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction: calling him a controlling asshole and wanting to go despite his concerns. She does acknowledge the implications, which suggests she sees the issue but still wants to go. That could be a sign she's prioritizing her job or social obligations over her partner's concerns.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. However, when there are clear signs of someone taking advantage, the partner has a right to be concerned. The fianc\u00e9 is using evidence (the timeline of events) to support his concerns, which isn't controlling per se but trying to explain his reasoning.\n\nSo, considering the boss's shady reputation and the suspicious changes in the dinner plans, the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid. He's not just being controlling without reason. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
