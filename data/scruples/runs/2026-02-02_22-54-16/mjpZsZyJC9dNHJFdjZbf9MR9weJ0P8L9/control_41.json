I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. The author is a guy whose fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm known for shady practices. The boss is someone with a bad reputation, and there's a series of events where the fianc\u00e9e keeps changing the details about the dinner. First, she says the author's SO is invited, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people, and then it turns out the boss is sending a car service. The author is really upset and thinks this is a bad idea, but the fianc\u00e9e is dismissing his concerns and calling him controlling. He's considering breaking up the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The author's main concern is about the boss's character and the situation's implications. The boss has a history of being unethical, and the circumstances around the dinner are suspicious. The author has valid reasons to be worried\u2014like the boss offering a car service after the fianc\u00e9e mentions her fianc\u00e9 can drive. That seems like a red flag for possible inappropriate behavior. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, downplays these concerns and accuses the author of being controlling. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, he's pointing out the timeline and the boss's actions, which do indicate possible ulterior motives. The fact that the boss is married and the fianc\u00e9e acknowledges that he can't affect his marriage suggests she's aware of the implications but still wants to go. The author's refusal is based on protecting his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially dangerous or unethical situation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being too controlling? But given the context\u2014shady boss, questionable circumstances\u2014it seems like his concerns are legitimate. The fianc\u00e9e is in a position where she's being singled out, and the boss's behavior is manipulative. The author is trying to protect her, which is a common concern in relationships. However, communication is key here. If the author didn't express his fears calmly, that could be an issue. But based on the description, he's been tracking the timeline and sharing it with her as evidence, which shows he's not just being paranoid.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about balancing trust in the relationship versus valid safety concerns. The author isn't necessarily being controlling without reason; he's reacting to specific red flags. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of his concerns might be contributing to the conflict. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are based on protecting his fianc\u00e9e from a situation that has multiple warning signs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
