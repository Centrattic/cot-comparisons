I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation with their fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a boss who has a bad reputation. The boss invited the fianc\u00e9 to a dinner to celebrate the firm's best year, but the details are confusing. The fianc\u00e9 didn't seem to notice the red flags, but the author did. The boss sent a car, the invite changed from including SOs to just certain people, and the attendees are all young women. The author is upset and thinks something's off, but the fianc\u00e9 insists it's fine. They're now arguing, and the author is considering breaking up the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is being overbearing or justifiably concerned. The author is pointing out inconsistencies and potential issues, like the boss's behavior, the sudden car service, and the selection of invitees. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nI need to consider if the author's concerns are valid. The boss's reputation is shady, and there's a possible conflict of interest or inappropriate behavior. The fact that the invitees are all young women might indicate favoritism or something more sinister. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as caring, but it's also possible he's being overly possessive.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 is an adult and has the right to make her own decisions. The author is questioning her judgment, which can be a point of conflict in a relationship. But the key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The boss's behavior (last-minute changes, offering a car service) could be suspicious, especially if he's known for unethical practices.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is not trusting her and is making a mountain out of a molehill. The author is using the timeline and evidence, which he's not wrong to do, but if he's using it to control her decisions, that's a problem. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags might indicate she's not seeing the issues, which could be a problem for the relationship's trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels his concerns are being dismissed. However, pushing her not to go could be seen as controlling. But given the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances, the author's concerns might be valid. It's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are based on genuine concerns or overprotectiveness. The situation does present red flags, so the author might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude could be the problem. So, the answer is B.\n"
