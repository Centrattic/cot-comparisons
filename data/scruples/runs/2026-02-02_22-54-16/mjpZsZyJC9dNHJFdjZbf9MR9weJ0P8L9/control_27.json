I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 being upset that his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the boss, who's described as a shady lawyer with a reputation for being a scammer. The fianc\u00e9e works at this firm, and the boss is taking a select group out to dinner. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9e gave conflicting information about the event, which makes the fianc\u00e9 suspicious. The key points that set off the fianc\u00e9 are the age and gender of the invitees\u2014mostly young women under 30. Then, the boss arranges a car service for her on the day of the dinner, which the fianc\u00e9 sees as a red flag.\n\nThe author (the fianc\u00e9) is frustrated because his fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the situation as problematic and is insisting on going. He feels it's a setup that could lead to inappropriate situations, especially considering the boss's reputation. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, thinks her partner is being controlling and overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's expressing concern about potential impropriety, which is a valid reason for worry. The boss's history adds to the red flags. The fianc\u00e9 isn't preventing her from going in a controlling way but is voicing his concerns based on the circumstances. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. However, given the boss's reputation and the circumstances (like the car service arranged by the boss), the fianc\u00e9's concerns are understandable. He's not making unfounded accusations but is reacting to a series of suspicious events. The fianc\u00e9e's insistence on going despite these concerns might be seen as dismissive of his valid worries.\n\nIn such cases, trust is key. However, when there are multiple red flags and a problematic work environment, the fianc\u00e9's caution isn't unreasonable. The question is whether overstepping occurred. The author isn't physically preventing her but is expressing his stance, which she might find controlling, but given the situation's context, his concerns are justified. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
