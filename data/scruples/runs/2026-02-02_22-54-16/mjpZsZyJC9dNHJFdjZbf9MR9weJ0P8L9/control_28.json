I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's upset because his fianc\u00e9e wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a problematic figure, an ambulance chaser type. The fianc\u00e9e was initially going to take the author, then changed her story, and now the dinner is just for select people, mostly young women. The boss is sending a car service, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the issue, and they're having a big fight about it.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (he's not). \n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially given the boss's shady reputation. The fact that the invitee list has only two women, both new employees, and the boss is providing a car service, which the author sees as a red flag. The fianc\u00e9e is dismissive of his concerns, calling him controlling. \n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, trust and communication are important. The author is worried about his fianc\u00e9e being in a situation that could be risky. The boss has a history of being unethical, and the circumstances of the dinner are sketchy. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e, but she sees it as controlling. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have each other's backs. However, controlling behavior can be a problem if it's based on jealousy or lack of trust without valid reasons. But here, there are specific red flags: the boss's reputation, the last-minute car service, and the exclusivity of the invitees. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e doesn't seem to recognize the potential issues. The author is acting on legitimate concerns about her safety and the boss's character. Even though he might be anxious, his reasons are tied to specific events that do raise suspicion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making the decision for her not to go, which could be seen as controlling. But considering the context, he's trying to prevent a possible problematic situation. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might indicate that she's not aware of the risks, or perhaps she's being dismissive. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't wrong for being concerned. The situation does have elements that are questionable. The key is whether his actions are reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author is acting out of concern and there are valid red flags, he's probably not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e might be in the wrong for not taking his concerns seriously and for going against his wishes in a situation that's risky.\n"
