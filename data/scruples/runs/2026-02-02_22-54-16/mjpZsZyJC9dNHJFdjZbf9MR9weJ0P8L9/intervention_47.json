I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with her boss, and the author is upset about it. I need to determine if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the details. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm, and the boss is known for shady practices. The author is concerned because the boss invited the fianc\u00e9 and another young female colleague for dinner, and there's a timeline of conflicting information. The boss sends a car service, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue and calls the author controlling. \n\nThe author is worried about potential impropriety given the boss's reputation and the setup of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks the author is overreacting. The author's main concern seems to be the power dynamic and the boss's history, which could lead to harassment or inappropriate situations. The fianc\u00e9's response implies she doesn't see the problem, even though she acknowledges the boss is married and can't do anything. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing concern based on evidence\u2014like the timeline of invites, the car service, and the boss's reputation. These are legitimate red flags. The fianc\u00e9 dismisses these concerns, which could indicate she's not taking the author's valid worries seriously. \n\nIn a relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, it's important to communicate concerns. The author tried to express his feelings and the reasons behind his objection. Being called controlling might be an emotional reaction, but if the underlying concerns are valid, the criticism is unwarranted. The boss's actions could be problematic, and the author is trying to protect the relationship by not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to go. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be overstepping by not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to make her own decision, especially if she feels comfortable. However, given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances, the author's caution is understandable. The key here is the balance between trust and safety. The author isn't forbidding the dinner out of jealousy but due to potential risks. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests she might be in denial about the situation's potential issues. Her insistence on going despite the author's concerns could be reckless. The author's actions stem from wanting to protect his future spouse from a possibly dangerous situation, which is not unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns and trying to prevent a risky situation. His actions are based on evidence and the desire to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of his concerns as controlling is misplaced, given the circumstances.\n"
