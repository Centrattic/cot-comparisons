I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, the situation involves the fianc\u00e9e's boss, who is described as having a shady reputation. The timeline shows a lot of inconsistencies in the plans, which the author points out. The boss keeps changing the details, and the list of invitees narrows down to just the fianc\u00e9e and another young female employee. The boss then insists on sending a car service, which raises more red flags for the author.\n\nThe author is concerned about the potential for inappropriate situations. He's not just being jealous; he's pointing out specific behaviors that are questionable. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't seem to see the problem and is upset that her partner is acting \"controlling.\"\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The author is expressing valid concerns based on observable facts (the timeline, the boss's behavior). He's not making baseless accusations but is reacting to a series of events that are concerning. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is dismissing his concerns and labeling him negatively, which can be a sign of dismissiveness in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might be a bit overbearing. Instead of outright forbidding her to go, maybe discussing the concerns and setting boundaries together would be better. But given the boss's history and the specific circumstances, the author's wariness is understandable and justifiable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's argument that the boss is married and thus can't act inappropriately is a bit naive. Even married individuals can engage in inappropriate behavior, and the author is right to be cautious. The situation has enough red flags that his reaction isn't unwarranted.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's voicing legitimate concerns and trying to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems defensive and dismissive, which might indicate deeper issues in their communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
