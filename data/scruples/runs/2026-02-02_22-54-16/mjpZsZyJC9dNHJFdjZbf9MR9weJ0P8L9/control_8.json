I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his girlfriend to go to dinner with her boss. The user is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the timeline: The fianc\u00e9 initially said the boss was inviting their partners, then changed it to a work party where the author could make other plans. Then it became clear that only certain people were invited, specifically young women. The boss arranges a car service, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue and wants to go, calling the author controlling.\n\nThe author's concerns are about the boss's reputation\u2014being an ambulance chaser, and the situation seems shady. The boss is married, but the fianc\u00e9 argues that he can't act on any advances. The author feels the situation is risky and wants to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from being in a potentially dangerous scenario.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the boss's company has a shady reputation, and the way the invitations were handled is odd. The fact that only young, female employees are invited and the last-minute car service could be a red flag. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is reasonable if there are legitimate concerns. The fianc\u00e9 not seeing the problem might be her being in denial or not recognizing the risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making decisions for her, which could be seen as controlling. But given the context, especially the boss's history and the strange circumstances, the author's actions might be justified as protective. The fianc\u00e9 dismissing his concerns and calling him names could indicate she's not taking his valid points seriously. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his concerns are based on real risks or just paranoia. The boss's background and the suspicious setup of the dinner suggest the author has reason to be cautious. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to protect her. Answer B.\n"
