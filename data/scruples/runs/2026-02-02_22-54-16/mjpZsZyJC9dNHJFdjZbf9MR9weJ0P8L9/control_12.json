I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. The situation seems pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the key points: The fianc\u00e9's boss is a high-profile lawyer at a firm known for being a bit shady, with a reputation as an ambulance chaser. The boss is inviting a select group of young female employees, including the fianc\u00e9 and a new attorney, to a celebratory dinner. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 was initially told the SOs were invited, then it changed, and the boss offered a car service, which the fianc\u00e9's partner found odd. The author is concerned about the implications, especially since the boss is married and the fianc\u00e9 is trying to reassure him but now is upset when he tries to stop her.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that the situation is suspicious. The boss's behavior might be inappropriate, especially since he's inviting young women and arranging transportation, which could be seen as a way to ensure privacy. The author is frustrated and feels that the fianc\u00e9 isn't recognizing the red flags. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is defensive, calling the author controlling and unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are trust and the fianc\u00e9's judgment. The author is expressing concerns based on the boss's reputation and the circumstances of the dinner. However, the fianc\u00e9 is in a position to assess her own workplace dynamics. If the boss is married and the author is assuming he's going to act inappropriately, that's a big assumption. The author's actions might be overstepping if he's making decisions for her without a concrete reason. The boss's actions could be genuine\u2014offering a car for safety, not for ulterior motives. The author has no actual evidence that the boss is going to do anything wrong, just his own suspicions and the boss's reputation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are not entirely baseless. The timeline changes and the boss's quick response to offer a car when the fianc\u00e9 suggests her partner driving might indicate something's off. The fact that the boss is known for being a scammer could make the situation more risky. But the fianc\u00e9 is an adult, and unless there's explicit evidence of the boss's intentions, the author can't unilaterally decide she shouldn't go. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is also a point. She called him a controlling asshole, which might be a valid response if he's not giving her a choice. In a relationship, communication is key. The author tried to express his concerns, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't seeing them the same way. It's possible that the author's approach was too confrontational, leading to the argument. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author has the right to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from attending. Without concrete evidence that the boss is going to do something wrong, the author's actions could be seen as controlling. However, his concerns might stem from a place of protecting his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially problematic situation. The line between being protective and being controlling is thin here. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the author should communicate his fears without being accusatory. But he did use evidence (texts, etc.) to back up his claims, which is reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9 is the one in a position to decide her own professional interactions. Unless the boss's behavior has been substantiated as inappropriate, the author might be overreacting. \n\nThe boss's own marital status is mentioned\u2014he's married. The fianc\u00e9 points this out, implying that he wouldn't risk his marriage. That could be a valid counterpoint, but it's speculative. The author's frustration is understandable, but the final decision should be mutual. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions are justified based on the given information. Since there's no proof of the boss's intentions, the author might be projecting his own fears onto the situation. The fianc\u00e9 is an adult, and unless there's a history of the boss harassing employees, the author is not necessarily in the right. However, the boss's reputation could be a red flag. \n\nGiven that the user is asking for a choice between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No), I need to decide. The author's main issue is his fianc\u00e9 going to dinner with a boss who has a shady reputation, and the boss arranging a car. The author is acting out of concern but isn't providing evidence of actual wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9 is defensive. In relationships, partners should support each other but also respect each other's autonomy. The author isn't wrong to have concerns, but he might be overstepping by refusing her to go without discussing it. So maybe the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A because he's being controlling without proof. Hmm. \n\nWait, the boss is a known scammer, which might imply unethical behavior. The author's intuition is that this is a problem. But the fianc\u00e9 is being invited as part of the staff, and the boss is trying to accommodate. The author's reaction could be seen as trusting his instincts, but the fianc\u00e9 is also in a position where she might need to make her own judgment. If the author is making decisions based on his concerns without her consent, that's where the issue is. However, the boss's actions do seem a bit odd, especially the last-minute car service. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for being concerned and trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially risky situation. The boss's behavior is suspicious, and the author has a right to express his concerns. However, the fianc\u00e9's autonomy is also important. The key is whether the author is justified in his concerns. Given the boss's reputation and the specific circumstances (only young females, changing the plans to use a car service), the author's intuition might be valid. But he's not providing evidence beyond his own suspicions. So, there's a balance. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong for having concerns and trying to prevent a potentially problematic situation. The fianc\u00e9 should be the one to decide, but the author's instincts might be right. However, his approach of flat-out refusing might be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong. Without evidence, maybe he is overreacting. But the boss's history and the specific circumstances could justify his concerns. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting on legitimate concerns about his fianc\u00e9's safety and the boss's reputation, even if it's based on intuition. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is dismissive, but the author has a right to be wary. However, this is a gray area. But given the options, B is more appropriate.\n"
