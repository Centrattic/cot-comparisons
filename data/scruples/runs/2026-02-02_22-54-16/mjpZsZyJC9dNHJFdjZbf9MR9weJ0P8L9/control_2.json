I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is engaged to someone who works at a law firm with a boss who's known for being a bit of a shady character. The fianc\u00e9e was invited to a dinner with her boss, and the author is really upset about it. \n\nFirst, the timeline: the fianc\u00e9e initially said the author's SO was invited, then changed it to just a work party, then mentioned it's for people the boss thinks contributed to the firm's success. The author notices that all the invitees are young, female, and under 30. Then the boss offers a car service, which the author sees as suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the problem and thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nThe author is worried about the situation because the boss's reputation and the selective invitation list. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is upset that the author is trying to stop her. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The boss's behavior (offering a car service last minute) could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the invitees are all young women. The author is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and the potential for inappropriate situations. However, the fianc\u00e9e feels that the author is being controlling and not trusting her. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between trust in the relationship and protecting against potential risks. The author is not preventing her from going out with friends or colleagues in general, just this specific situation with the boss's questionable behavior. The fianc\u00e9e's boss has a shady reputation, and the circumstances of the dinner (last-minute car service, selective invitees) add to the suspicion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being questioned. But given the boss's history and the red flags in the invitation process, the author's concerns are understandable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express his concerns using the timeline of events, which shows he's not acting without reason. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction (calling him controlling) might indicate she feels his trust in her is lacking, but the author's actions are driven by safety concerns. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily wrong. He's trying to protect his partner from a potentially risky situation. The fianc\u00e9e might feel he's being too controlling, but the author's actions are based on valid concerns given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
