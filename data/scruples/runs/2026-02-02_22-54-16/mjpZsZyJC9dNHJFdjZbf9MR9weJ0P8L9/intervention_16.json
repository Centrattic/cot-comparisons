I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who is upset about their partner going to a dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline and the concerns. The author of the post is the fianc\u00e9 who is hesitant about the dinner. The boss's behavior seems a bit fishy. The key points are:\n\n1. The boss organized a dinner, initially saying spouses are invited, then changing to a work party. Later, the invite is only to select people, mostly young women. The boss offers a car service, which makes the author suspicious. \n\n2. The author finds the situation shady and wants to stop the fianc\u00e9 from going, leading to conflict. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nThe author is worried about potential impropriety, especially given the boss's reputation and the way the dinner was arranged. The fianc\u00e9 downplays the concerns, calling the author controlling. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author's concerns are valid or if they're being overbearing. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be concerned about their partner's safety and the potential for inappropriate situations. The boss's actions\u2014selecting young female employees, offering a car service\u2014could be red flags. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9 and their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is being too controlling, not trusting her, and overreacting. The author is using evidence (texts, emails) to support their concerns, which could be seen as valid communication. However, the way they approach it might come off as confrontational, leading to the argument.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's concerns are reasonable. The boss's behavior does have elements that are concerning, especially the last-minute car service and the sudden selection of young female employees. The author isn't just being paranoid; there are specific actions that raise red flags. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling that her autonomy is being questioned, but the author's intent is protective.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is addressing legitimate concerns. The author isn't preventing the fianc\u00e9 from going for no reason. They have specific reasons based on the timeline and the boss's actions. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns as controlling could be a misjudgment.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is probably not in the wrong. They're voicing valid concerns stemming from observable actions. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the approach than the content of the concerns. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
