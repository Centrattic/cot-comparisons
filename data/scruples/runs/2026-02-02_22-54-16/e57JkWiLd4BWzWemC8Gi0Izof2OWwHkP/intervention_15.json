My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The scenario is that the author is 17, can't cook beyond a few basic things, and after coming home late from school, their mom didn't have dinner ready. The mom expects the author to cook, but they can't, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're 17, not been taught cooking by their mom, and now expected to handle dinner. They tried to ask for help or a ride to buy something, but the mom refused. The author feels frustrated and hungry, leading to getting angry. \n\nThe mom's side: She's saying the author is old enough to figure it out. The sister is 14 and can cook, implying the mom did teach the sister. The mom also points out that there are ingredients available, so the author should use them. She refuses to buy more food even though there's existing stuff, possibly trying to encourage self-sufficiency.\n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics, parents often expect children to become more independent as they grow older. But at 17, expecting someone to cook without any prior instruction might be unreasonable. The mom might be trying to push responsibility, but if she never taught the skills, that's a problem. The sister being 14 and already cooking suggests the mom has taught other children, so maybe the author feels neglected in terms of learning opportunities.\n\nThe author's anger comes from feeling unprepared and hungry after a long day. The mom's response seems dismissive of the author's limitations. The key points are whether the mom is responsible for teaching basic cooking skills and if expecting a 17-year-old to improvise without any training is fair.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset because they've been put in a situation where they're expected to do something they weren't taught. The mom's refusal to help, despite the author's requests, might be the root issue here. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
