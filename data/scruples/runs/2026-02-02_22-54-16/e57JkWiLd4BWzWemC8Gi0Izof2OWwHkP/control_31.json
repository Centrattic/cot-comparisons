My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, got angry at their mom for not cooking dinner because they can't cook. Their mom told them to figure it out, and the author feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 17 and hasn't been taught how to cook by their mom. They can only make simple things like ramen. They worked late and expected dinner, but the mom expects them to cook themselves. The mom's response was to tell the author to use what's available and mentions that the 14-year-old sister can cook, implying that the author should be able to as well. The author feels they can't and got mad.\n\nOn one hand, 17 is an age where some independence is expected, but not everyone is taught life skills like cooking. The author is asking for help, but the mom isn't providing it. The mom might argue that the author should learn to be self-sufficient. On the other hand, the author is still a minor, depending on their parents, and maybe the mom should have taught them how to cook earlier. The fact that the sister was taught shows that the mom is capable, but maybe she didn't prioritize the author's needs.\n\nThe author's anger is directed at the mom for not providing the support they needed. The mom's response seems dismissive, not addressing the author's lack of skills. The author is in a position where they can't help themselves, which is a problem the mom might be responsible for. The author's frustration is understandable because they were left hungry when they expected dinner after working late. The mom's refusal to help, even to buy pre-made food, seems harsh, especially since the author can't drive.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's failure to teach necessary life skills and then expecting the author to handle it without support is the issue. The author's anger is a response to the lack of support and preparation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
