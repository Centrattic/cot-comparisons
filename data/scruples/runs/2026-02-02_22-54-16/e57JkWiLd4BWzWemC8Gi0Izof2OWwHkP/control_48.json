My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, hasn't been taught, and is 17. They came home expecting dinner but the mom told them to figure it out. The author is frustrated because they can't cook much, their sister was taught, but they weren't. They asked to be driven to the store but the mom refused. The author then went to their room, and now they're wondering if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, especially since the sister is 14 and can cook. The mom might feel that the child is old enough to learn. But the author is 17 and hasn't been taught, which is a long time. Not teaching a teenager basic life skills like cooking could be seen as neglect. The mom's response was dismissive, which could be hurtful. The author was working on prom, which might have made them more stressed or hungry, contributing to their anger.\n\nThe author's perspective: They have a legitimate need for food but can't prepare it themselves. The mom didn't help, even though there's a lack of prior teaching. The author's frustration is justified because they're in a situation where they can't meet a basic need due to the mom's prior neglect. The argument escalated because the mom refused to offer support, leading the author to feel abandoned. The author's anger isn't just about dinner but also about not being taught essential skills.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The mom didn't teach them to cook and then expects them to handle it. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and unsupported. The mom's refusal to help, even when the author asked, shows a lack of support. The author's actions (going to their room) are a response to frustration but not necessarily wrong. However, the author could have tried to find another solution, like using resources they have, but given their limited skills, maybe they couldn't. The key issue is the mom's responsibility in not teaching life skills. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
