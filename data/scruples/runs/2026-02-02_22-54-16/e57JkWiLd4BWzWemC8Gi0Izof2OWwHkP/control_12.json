My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and feels their mom isn't helping them. They got home expecting dinner but were told to cook themselves. They tried to explain they can't, but the mom insisted they figure it out, even mentioning their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The kid gets mad and storms off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The kid is 17, which is an age where parents might expect some independence, but they haven't been taught cooking. They can't drive, so can't get food themselves. The mom might feel they should learn basic skills, but the kid is stuck without knowing how to cook. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help. The kid's frustration is understandable because they're hungry and not being supported. The mom's refusal to drive them to buy something they can cook adds to the problem. The sister was taught, so there's a precedent. The kid's anger is about being left without a solution. So, the mom might share some responsibility for not teaching them. The kid's reaction is valid given the circumstances. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
