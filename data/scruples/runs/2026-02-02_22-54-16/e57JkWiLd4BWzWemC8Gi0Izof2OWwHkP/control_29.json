My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom said to figure it out. The author is upset and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: she might think that at 17, the child should be learning to cook. She did teach their 14-year-old sister, so maybe she expected the older child to pick it up on their own. But the author says the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them. That's a valid point. At 17, it's reasonable to start learning life skills, but if the mom didn't provide any instruction or support, that's a problem.\n\nThe author worked late on prom decorations, so they were tired and just wanted dinner. They asked for help, like being driven to the store, but the mom refused. The author is frustrated because they genuinely can't cook anything beyond simple items. The argument escalated, leading to the author going to their room.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, getting angry might be a reaction to being left without dinner when they can't cook. But maybe they could have handled the situation differently, like preparing something simple earlier. However, the mom's refusal to help or teach is a key factor here. If the mom didn't teach them and now expects them to cook without support, that's a failure in parenting. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not having dinner when they can't cook, especially since the responsibility wasn't taught to them. The sister was taught, so the mom's inconsistency might be an issue. The author's request for help was denied, leading to hunger and frustration. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
