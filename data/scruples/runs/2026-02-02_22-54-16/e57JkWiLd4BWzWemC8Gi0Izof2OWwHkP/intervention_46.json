My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide if they are.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, which is a teenager. They haven't been taught how to cook by their mom. The mom's response seems dismissive, telling the kid to \"get creative\" and pointing out that their 14-year-old sister can cook. But the 14-year-old was actually taught, while the older kid wasn't. That's a bit contradictory. Also, the mom doesn't help by driving them to the store, even though the kid can't drive. So the mom's actions are contributing to the problem.\n\nThe author got angry because they were hungry and couldn't cook. Is it reasonable to get mad? Well, the mom didn't set them up with the skills they needed. If the mom refuses to help, the kid is in a tough spot. The author's frustration is understandable. They were expecting dinner after working late. The mom's response is not supportive. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The mom is responsible for not teaching them and not providing alternatives. The author's anger is a reaction to the mom's lack of support. So answer B.\n"
