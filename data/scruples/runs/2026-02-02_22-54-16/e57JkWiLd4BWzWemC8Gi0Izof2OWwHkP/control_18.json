My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook much besides some basics, worked late on prom stuff, and expected dinner. The mom didn't cook and instead told them to make something, which they can't. The mom also mentions the sister, who is 14 and can cook, and refuses to help get food. The author got upset and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught cooking skills. They worked late, expecting dinner, which is reasonable. The mom expects them to cook without prior teaching. The author's frustration is understandable because they aren't equipped to cook, so expecting them to just figure it out might be unreasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially when comparing to the younger sister who was taught. Also, the mom doesn't allow the author to drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The author's anger stems from not being supported despite the lack of skills.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that at 17, the author should start learning independence. However, if the parent never provided the necessary skills, expecting sudden capability isn't fair. Parents are generally responsible for providing meals until kids are self-sufficient. The author's request for help (store, instructions) was denied, leading to hunger and frustration.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The author's anger is justified given the lack of teaching. The mom's response is neglecting a responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
