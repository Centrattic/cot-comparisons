My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much beyond simple things, and their mom didn't teach them. They worked late and expected dinner, but the mom insisted they figure it out. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook, but the author points out the mom actually taught the sister. Now, the author is upset and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. At 17, one might expect some independence, but the author clearly states they weren't taught how to cook. The mom's response seems dismissive, not helpful. The author's frustration is about being left without options when they haven't been given the skills. The mom's argument that the sister can cook doesn't address the fact that the author wasn't taught. The author is also a minor, so some responsibility might still lie with the parents to provide meals if the child hasn't been taught. The author's anger comes from feeling abandoned and unprepared. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the mom didn't equip them with necessary skills and is now leaving them to fend for themselves without support.\n"
