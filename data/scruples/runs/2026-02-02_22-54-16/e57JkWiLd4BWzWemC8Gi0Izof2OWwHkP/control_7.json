My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who's upset because their mom didn't cook dinner and instead told them to figure it out. The kid can't cook, only knows basic stuff like ramen, and the mom is pushing them to use the stove and get creative. The sister, who's 14, can cook, so the comparison is a bit harsh.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that they were expecting dinner because they were working on prom until 7 PM. They felt frustrated because they can't cook, and the mom didn't teach them. The mom's response seems dismissive, telling them to use the stuff they have and even referencing the younger sister who can cook. The author then goes to their room in frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they are 17 and haven't been taught cooking skills. If that's the case, the mom might be partly responsible for not teaching them. Also, the author was working on school activities, which is a valid reason to expect dinner. The mom's response of sending them to make their own meal without support or teaching is harsh, especially since the author can't cook. The mom also doesn't offer help, just insists they figure it out. Comparing them to the younger sister who was actually taught might be unfair here.\n\nOn the other hand, 17 is an age where one might be expected to start learning independence, including cooking. But if the mother never taught them, the responsibility isn't entirely on the child. The author's frustration stems from being unprepared and not having support. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store when they asked for help also adds to the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the mom didn't provide the necessary skills or support. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and left without options when they were already tired from work. The mother's dismissive attitude and lack of teaching seem to be the root issues here.\n"
