My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much beyond simple things like ramen or mac and cheese. They came home from school at 7 PM expecting dinner, but the mom said to figure it out themselves. The author points out that the mom never taught them how to cook, and even their 14-year-old sister could make her own dinner. The mom refuses to drive them to buy food they can cook, and the author ended up upset and hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the expectations. At 17, there's an expectation to start learning life skills, including cooking. However, if the mom never taught the author how to cook, it's a bit of a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because they're not equipped to handle something that others their age might take for granted. The mom's response seems dismissive, not helping despite the author's clear lack of skills. The fact that the sister was taught to cook and is younger adds to the author's point about the mom's lack of support.\n\nBut then, at 17, maybe the author should have taken initiative to learn earlier. However, the mom didn't provide that opportunity. The author also mentioned they can't drive, so even if they wanted to buy food, they can't go alone. The mom's refusal to help in that aspect compounds the issue. The author's anger might be justified because the mom isn't providing the necessary support or resources. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset when their basic needs aren't met, especially when they've been denied the skills to handle it themselves.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the mom's lack of teaching, the author's inability to cook, the sister's example, and the lack of transportation, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
