My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner because they can't cook themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, hasn't been taught how to cook, and their mom doesn't trust them. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but mom told them to figure it out. The author can't cook anything beyond simple items like ramen, chicken nuggets, etc. They tried to reason with their mom but she insisted they should figure it out, even mentioning their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The author wanted to go to the store but mom refused.\n\nThe author is frustrated and hungry, and the question is if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, family dynamics and expectations play a role. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but cooking isn't always a skill everyone learns at that age. The mom might be trying to push responsibility, but if she never taught them, it's a bit unfair to expect them to figure it out without support. The author's frustration is valid because they were hungry and expected dinner after a long day. The mom's refusal to help, despite the lack of prior teaching, could be seen as neglecting their child's needs. The sister being 14 and able to cook suggests the mom might have different expectations for her, which adds to the author's feeling of being unhelped.\n\nSo, considering that the mom didn't teach the author, refused to help despite the author's clear inability, and the author was just trying to get a meal after a long day, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
