My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 17-year-old kid can't cook and expects their mom to provide dinner when they get home. The mom says there's stuff to cook and that the kid should figure it out. The kid argues they weren't taught and asks for help, like driving to the store, but the mom refuses. The kid gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid is 17, which is an adult age, but still a teenager. They say they weren't taught how to cook, which is the mom's responsibility. The mom might think that at 17, the kid should start learning to cook for themselves. However, the kid also mentions that their sister, who's 14, was taught, so maybe there's inconsistency in the parents' approach. \n\nThe mom's response seems to be pushing the kid to be independent, but if they weren't taught, expecting them to cook might be unrealistic. Plus, the kid can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option for them. The mom's refusal to help might be seen as not supporting the kid's needs. \n\nAlso, the kid was working on prom decorations until 7 PM, so maybe they were tired and expecting dinner. The mom might not have known about the kid's schedule. The kid's frustration is understandable because they're hungry and not equipped to cook. However, getting angry and retreating to their room could be seen as avoiding the problem or not communicating effectively. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the kid is in the wrong for being upset. Since the mom didn't provide dinner and didn't help the kid get food, even though the kid can't cook, the kid's anger makes sense. The mom is supposed to provide for them, until they're capable of independent living. At 17, maybe some responsibility is expected, but without teaching, the mom is partly responsible for the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the mom didn't teach the kid to cook and didn't help when asked, leading to the kid's frustration. The kid's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner despite not being taught necessary skills.\n"
