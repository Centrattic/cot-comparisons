My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook, relying on easy foods like ramen or chicken nuggets. They came home expecting dinner but their mom said they should just make something. The mom didn't teach them how to cook and didn't help when the kid asked for assistance. The kid got frustrated and went to their room.\n\nFirst, the kid's situation: they can't cook, mom never taught them, and now they're left on their own. The mom's response seems dismissive. The kid is hungry and stressed from school. The mom also mentions that the sister, who's 14, can make her own dinner, but the kid points out that the mom actually taught the sister how to cook. The kid even asked to be driven to buy something they can make, but the mom refused.\n\nIs the kid in the wrong for getting mad? Well, they're 17 and not been taught basic cooking skills. The mom's approach might be contributing to the problem. The kid isn't being unreasonable to expect some guidance, especially if they haven't been taught. The mom's response to just \"get creative\" without support seems unfair. The kid's frustration is justified because they're in a position where they can't meet their basic need for food without help they haven't received. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
