My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and after a long day of work, expected dinner but their mom didn't provide it. The mom's responses seem dismissive, especially when the author mentions not knowing how to cook. The author is frustrated and hungry, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, considering the age: 17 is still a minor in many places, and while some teens learn to cook earlier, not teaching a kid to cook until 17 could be a parental oversight. The mom didn't teach the author and didn't trust them to learn on their own. The sister, who is 14, was taught, so there's inconsistency in parental support here. \n\nThe author worked until 7 PM, so they had a long day. Coming home expecting dinner is reasonable. The mom's response to \"Whatever you can find\" and pushing the responsibility onto the author, especially when they can't cook much, seems unfair. The mom also refused to help by driving them to the store, even though the author can't drive. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they were left without dinner despite their efforts. The argument escalating to the point of going to their room is a reaction to feeling unsupported. The key points are the lack of prior teaching, the mom's dismissive attitude, and the author's legitimate need for sustenance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They expressed their needs but were met with resistance. Getting upset in that situation is a natural response. The mom's actions (not teaching, not providing dinner, refusing help) contributed to the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
