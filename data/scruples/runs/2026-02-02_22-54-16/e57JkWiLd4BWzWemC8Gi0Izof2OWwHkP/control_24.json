My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person is 17, can't cook much, and expected dinner after coming home from school. The mom said to find something to cook, but the kid can't. The mom mentions that the sister, who's 14, can cook, so maybe there's inconsistency in teaching.\n\nFirst, the kid's perspective: They can't cook, maybe because the mom didn't teach them. At 17, it's a bit late not to have basic cooking skills, but maybe the mom didn't prioritize it. The kid worked late on prom, so maybe they were tired and hungry. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help. Instead of driving them to the store, she says no. The kid got fed up and went to their room. \n\nFrom the mom's side, she might think the child should be more independent. But if she taught the sister, maybe there's inconsistency. The kid can't drive, so getting food is harder. The mom might be trying to push independence, but not considering the kid's actual inability. \n\nIs the kid in the wrong? They did express frustration, but maybe they could have handled it better. Like asking for help earlier or finding another solution. But the mom's lack of teaching is a key point. The kid's anger might be justified because the mom didn't set them up to succeed. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old can cook without being taught is unrealistic. \n\nBut maybe the kid should have tried to cook something simple. However, if they really can't use the stove properly, that's a safety issue. The mom's response of \"get creative\" is not helpful. The kid's frustration is valid. \n\nSo the person is not in the wrong because the parent didn't teach them, and the situation wasn't handled with consideration. The answer is B.\n"
