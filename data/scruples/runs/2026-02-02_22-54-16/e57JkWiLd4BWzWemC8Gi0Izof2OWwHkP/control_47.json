My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They come home from school late, expecting dinner, but the mom says they need to cook themselves. The author gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's point is that they were never taught how to cook, so they can't just \"figure it out\" as their mom suggests. The mom's side might be that at 17, they should be learning these life skills, especially since the sister is 14 and can cook. The author can't drive, so they can't even go get pre-made food easily. They were working on prom decorations, so maybe they were tired and expected dinner.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Maybe not. If the parent didn't teach them, expecting a 17-year-old to suddenly handle cooking without any guidance seems harsh. However, the author did get mad and walked out. That could be seen as not handling the situation calmly. But if they were hungry and frustrated, maybe that's a normal reaction.\n\nThe mom's response might be neglecting the child's needs, especially if the child has consistently not been taught. But the mom might feel like the child needs to learn independence. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry in this scenario. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's anger seems justified given the lack of prior teaching and the mom's refusal to help. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
