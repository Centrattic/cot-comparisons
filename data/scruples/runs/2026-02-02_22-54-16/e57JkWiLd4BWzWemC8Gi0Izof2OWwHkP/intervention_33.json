My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, a 17-year-old, getting upset with their mom for not cooking dinner. The key points here are the author's inability to cook, the mom not teaching them, and the mom's response when asked for help.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they can't cook anything beyond basic items like ramen. The mom didn't teach them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. The author works on school projects until 7 PM and expects dinner. The mom tells them to find something to cook, but the author can't. The mom then compares them to their 14-year-old sister who can cook, but the author points out that the mom actually taught the sister. The author asks to go to the store, but the mom refuses. The author gets frustrated and goes to their room.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 17, they're still a minor and might rely on their parents for meals. The mom's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging the lack of teaching. The author is hungry, worked late, and is in a situation where they can't cook. The mom's refusal to help or provide resources (like driving them to the store) adds to the problem. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. The mom's behavior here is not supportive, especially since they haven't provided the necessary skills. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
