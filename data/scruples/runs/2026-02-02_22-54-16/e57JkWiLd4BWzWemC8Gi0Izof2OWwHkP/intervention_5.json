My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They worked on prom until 7 PM and expected dinner, but mom said they should figure it out. The mom also mentions their sister is 14 and can cook, and she won't drive them to the store. The author argues they weren't taught how to use the stove or cook, and mom won't help.\n\nFirst, consider the age. 17 is a bit old for a parent to not have taught basic cooking skills. But on the other hand, teaching cooking is a parental responsibility. The mom hasn't taught them, and now is expecting a 17-year-old to handle it without guidance. The sister being 14 and able to cook suggests the mom might be pushing responsibility onto the older child when the younger is already more capable. That could be unfair.\n\nAlso, the author worked late and expected dinner, which is reasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive. The fact that the author can't drive adds to the problem\u2014they can't even get ingredients. The mom's refusal to help despite the author's clear lack of skills might be neglecting her role. \n\nThe author's frustration makes sense. They're hungry, tired from work, and not given the tools to fix the situation. The mom's response could be seen as not supporting her child, especially since she didn't teach them to cook. So the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry. The answer is B.\n"
