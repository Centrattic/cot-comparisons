My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom never taught them. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but mom didn't have anything ready. The mom's response was to tell them to figure it out, even though she didn't teach them how. The author feels frustrated because they can't cook and their mom isn't helping, even though the younger sister (14) was taught. The author is hungry, can't drive, and mom won't help them get food.\n\nSo, the key points: The mom didn't teach cooking, didn't prepare dinner, dismissed the child's inability, and the child is left without food. The author is asking if they're at fault for getting mad.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're 17, which is still considered a minor in many places. It's reasonable to expect parents to provide meals or teach necessary skills. The mom isn't fulfilling her responsibility here. The author's frustration is valid because they're not equipped to handle cooking and were left without options. The mom's response is dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for help they weren't given. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
