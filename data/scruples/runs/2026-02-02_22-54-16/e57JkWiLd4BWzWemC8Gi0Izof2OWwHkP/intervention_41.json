My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17 and can't cook. Their mom never taught them, and they rely on instant stuff. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but mom said they should figure it out. The person is frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping. The sister, who's 14, can cook, but the mom taught her. The person can't drive, so they can't get to the store. The mom refuses to buy them pre-cooked food. The person gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants to know the answer. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's side: They're 17, can't cook, and the mom hasn't taught them. They worked late and expected dinner. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering help. The author's frustration is understandable. They asked for help but were denied. The mom's attitude that the child should \"figure it out\" despite lack of skills might be unreasonable. The sister being able to cook at 14 suggests the mom can teach, but didn't for the older child. \n\nFrom the mom's side: She might be trying to teach independence. However, the author clearly hasn't been taught and isn't capable yet. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store or provide pre-cooked options adds to the problem. The author is in a vulnerable position, relying on the mom for basics like food. The mom's response lacks empathy for the author's situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit about expectations. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but the mom hasn't provided the necessary skills. The author's anger stems from being left without resources. The mom's role is to support and teach, not just assign tasks without preparation. The author isn't wrong for being upset when their needs aren't met, especially when the parent hasn't equipped them to handle the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
