My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is 17 and can't cook anything beyond a few simple things. They were working on school stuff until 7 PM, expecting dinner at home, but the mom didn't have anything ready. The mom told them to find something to cook themselves, but the author can't cook. The mom mentions that the author's 14-year-old sister can cook, and when the author asks for help to buy something, the mom refuses. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author is 17, which is a teenager, but they haven't been taught how to cook by their mom. They mention that the mom never trusted them to teach themselves. The mom's response seems to be pushing the author to figure it out themselves, even though they clearly can't. The author is working late and expects dinner, which is a reasonable expectation. The mom's refusal to help or provide alternatives like taking them to the store is causing the conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being mad? Well, they have a legitimate reason to be upset because they're hungry and their needs aren't being met. The mom isn't providing support or teaching necessary life skills, which is her responsibility. The author is in a situation where they can't cook, and the mom isn't helping them learn or providing a solution. The sister is 14 and can cook, but the author is older and hasn't been taught. The mom's response seems dismissive and unhelpful. The author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. They're asking for help, but the mom is not offering it, leading to the argument. So, in this case, it seems the author isn't in the wrong; the mom's actions (or lack thereof) are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
