My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17 and can't cook anything beyond a few simple items. Their mom didn't teach them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. They stayed late at school for prom decorations and expected dinner. When they got home, the mom said to figure it out, but the person can't cook. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook, but the person points out that the mom actually taught the sister. They asked to be driven to the store to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused.\n\nFirst, the author's frustration is understandable. Being 17 and not knowing how to cook is a problem, especially when they have a sibling who was taught. However, the author's right to expect dinner might depend on family norms. If the mom usually provides meals, then expecting dinner is reasonable. The mom's refusal to help despite knowing the author's lack of cooking skills is an issue. The author's anger stems from being left hungry when they had a legitimate expectation of a meal. The mom's response is dismissive and doesn't address the author's inability to cook. The author isn't being unreasonable for getting upset; they're a teenager in a situation where they can't prepare a meal themselves. The mom's failure to teach them cooking skills and then expecting them to handle dinner is part of the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
