My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond a few simple foods. They came home from school working on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner to be ready. Their mom didn't cook, and when the author asked, the mom suggested they figure it out themselves. The author tried to explain they can't cook, and the mom pointed out their 14-year-old sister can make her own dinner. The author asked to be driven to the store to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused. The author got upset and went to their room.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some responsibility, but the author has never been taught how to cook. The mom didn't teach the author and now expects them to cook, which they can't. The author worked until 7 PM, which is pretty late, so maybe they were tired and hungry. The mom's response seems dismissive, and the fact that the sister was taught but the author wasn't adds to the issue. The author's frustration is about not being supported when they need help. \n\nThe mom might be right in terms of expecting the teenager to be more independent, but if the parent never taught them, that's part of the problem. The author isn't wrong for being upset when they're not given the tools to handle the situation. The key points are the lack of prior teaching and the parent's refusal to help despite the author's inability. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're in a situation where they weren't given the skills to be independent, and the parent isn't providing support when needed. The author's frustration is valid here.\n"
