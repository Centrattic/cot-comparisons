My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is 17, can't cook, and got mad at their mom for not having dinner ready. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom said they should figure it out. The author points out that their mom never taught them how to cook, and even their 14-year-old sister could make her own dinner. The mom didn't offer help or take them to buy food they could cook, which the author asked for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. At 17, the author is an adolescent, and it's generally expected that parents would teach their kids basic life skills, like cooking. The fact that the mom hasn't taught them and now expects them to cook without any guidance might be a problem. The author isn't asking for the mom to cook for them, just to have some support in learning or getting ingredients for something simple. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They were working on prom decorations until 7 PM and just wanted a meal. When the mom dismisses their inability to cook and even brings up the sister who was taught, it seems like the mom isn't acknowledging the author's need for help. The author isn't being unreasonable by getting upset; they're in a situation where they can't prepare a meal without assistance, and the mom isn't providing that. \n\nHowever, the author did get angry and went to their room, which might be seen as an overreaction. But considering they were hungry and the mom was unhelpful, it's a valid reaction. The key point is whether the mom failed in her responsibility to teach the author to cook, leading to the author being in this situation. Since the mom didn't teach them and now expects them to figure it out, the author isn't in the wrong. They're the victim of the mom's lack of support. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
