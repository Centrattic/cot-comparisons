My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook anything beyond a few basic items. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. After a long day at school, they come home expecting dinner, but their mom insists they cook it themselves. The mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying the user should be able to as well. The user argues they can't use the stove properly and asks for help going to the store, but the mom refuses. The user gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The user is 17 and hasn't been taught cooking skills. The mom might be trying to push independence, but not teaching a child to cook can lead to dependency. The user worked late, which could add stress. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering alternatives like teaching or helping. The sister being 14 and able to cook might mean the mom started teaching earlier, which is age-appropriate, but the user didn't get that same chance. The user's frustration is understandable given the lack of support. However, the user did get angry and left the room, which could be seen as not handling the situation calmly. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a justified reaction to being dismissed. The mom's refusal to help when the user is clearly unable to cook is a key point. The user isn't asking for someone else to cook for them, just assistance in getting ingredients for something they can make. The mom's response of \"no\" without alternatives seems harsh. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
