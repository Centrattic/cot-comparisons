My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond basic stuff like ramen, chicken nuggets, or mac and cheese. Their mom didn't teach them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. The author was working on prom decorations late, expecting dinner, but the mom told them to use the available ingredients and make something. The author tried to explain they can't cook, and the mom mentioned their 14-year-old sister who can make her own meals. The mom also refused to drive them to the store. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 17, it's a bit of a gray area. At 17 in the US, many kids are still under their parents' care and might not have learned to cook yet. However, there's a push towards independence as they approach adulthood. The mom's response seems dismissive. She did teach the sister, which is a point of comparison, but the sister is younger but maybe more self-sufficient. However, the author's request for help, like driving to the store, was denied, which could be seen as the mom not providing necessary support. The author's frustration is about being left without a meal despite not having the skills to cook.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's lack of cooking skills due to not being taught, the mom's expectation that the author figure it out, and the absence of any support. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and not having the means to get food. The mom's actions might be neglecting her responsibility to ensure the child isn't left hungry. The sister's ability to cook isn't a valid excuse here because the author hasn't been taught. The author's request for help was reasonable but denied.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset because the situation reflects a lack of support from the parent. The mom didn't teach them to cook, refused assistance when needed, and left the author without a meal. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
