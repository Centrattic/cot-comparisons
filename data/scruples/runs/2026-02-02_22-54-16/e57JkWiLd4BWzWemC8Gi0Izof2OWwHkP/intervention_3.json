My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The person is 17, can't cook, and got mad at their mom because she didn't prepare dinner. The mom said they should figure it out, but the author can't cook anything beyond basic instant foods. They were at school late, expected dinner, and the mom didn't provide it. The author then got upset and went to their room.\n\nHmm. The person is 17, which is still a minor in most places. Depending on the culture, some parents might expect their teens to start learning basic cooking skills, but the mom here admitted she never taught them. So the author isn't necessarily at fault for not knowing. The mom did mention their 14-year-old sister who can cook, but that might not be relevant because the author wasn't taught. The mom also refused to help them get food, even though the author can't drive. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they were working late and expected dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging the lack of skills. The author didn't lash out aggressively, just expressed frustration and went to their room. I think the mom is more at fault here for not providing support, but the question is about the author. Since the author didn't do anything wrong\u2014just being honest about their inability and getting upset when not supported\u2014I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
