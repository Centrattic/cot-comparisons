My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 17-year-old who can't cook and is upset with their mom for not providing dinner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and circumstances. At 17, while many people are learning to cook, the author hasn't been taught and can't use the stove properly. They mention being untrusted with cooking or driving, which suggests a lack of support from the parent. The mom expects them to figure it out, but the author isn't capable.\n\nNext, the situation: after working on prom until 7 PM, they come home expecting dinner. The mom says \"whatever you can find,\" leading to an argument. The author feels frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping. The sister, who's 14, is making her own dinner, but the author wasn't taught the same. The mom refuses to drive them to buy food they can cook, even though they have the ingredients.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing frustration over not being taught a necessary life skill. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner despite not having the skills to prepare it. The mom's actions (not teaching, not helping now) contribute to the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Their needs aren't being met, and the parent isn't providing necessary support. The answer should be B.\n"
