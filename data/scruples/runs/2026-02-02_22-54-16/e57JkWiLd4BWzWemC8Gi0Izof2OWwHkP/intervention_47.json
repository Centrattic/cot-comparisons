My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook anything beyond a few simple items, and their mom didn't teach them. After coming home late from school, they expected dinner but the mom said it was up to them to cook. The author got angry and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is 17, which is still young in many cultures, but some might argue they should be learning life skills. The mom's response is that they're old enough to figure it out, but hasn't taught them. Also, the sister, 14, was taught how to cook. The author can't drive, so even if they wanted to buy food, they can't. The mom refuses to buy them food they can cook, saying they already have supplies. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they haven't been taught. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old should cook without prior teaching might be unreasonable. However, the author could have handled it differently, like staying calm and asking for help. But the anger might stem from being unprepared and hungry. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store adds to the problem since the author can't drive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom didn't teach cooking skills, which is a parent's role in some cases. The author's reaction is understandable given the lack of skills and support. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
