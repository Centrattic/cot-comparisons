My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. So I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and can't cook. Their mom never taught them. They mentioned they can only do basic stuff like ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. They worked late on prom decorations and expected dinner. When they got home, their mom told them to \"get creative\" with cooking, but the author can't cook. The mom brings up the sister, 14, who can make her own dinner. The author asks to be driven to buy something they can cook, but the mom refuses. The author gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nSo the key points here are the lack of cooking skills, the expectation of self-sufficiency at 17, and the mom's response. The author feels wronged because they were promised dinner but it wasn't there, and the mom didn't help despite the author's limitations. The mom's response seems to be pushing responsibility onto the author without providing the necessary support. The sister being 14 and already cooking might add to the author's frustration, maybe feeling left out or not given the same attention.\n\nI should consider societal expectations. At 17, some might expect more independence, but if the parent hasn't provided the necessary skills, that's a problem. The mom's refusal to drive the author to buy food when they can't cook and can't drive themselves might be seen as not providing support. The author's anger is justified if they were left hungry without alternatives. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old can figure it out when they clearly can't is part of the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong because the parent has a responsibility to support their child's needs, especially when the child hasn't been taught essential life skills. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
