My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 17-year-old who can't cook and expected dinner after coming home from school. The mom didn't cook and instead told the kid to figure it out, even though the kid can't cook and the mom never taught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and responsibility. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but cooking isn't something everyone learns at that age. The mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions the sister, who's 14, but the kid points out that the sister was actually taught how to cook. The mom refuses to take the kid to buy food, which is an option the kid can't do on their own because they can't drive. \n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They worked late and just want dinner. The mom's expectation that they \"figure it out\" without prior teaching or resources is unreasonable. The kid is in a situation where they don't have the skills or access to get food, leading to hunger. The argument that the kid is 17 and should be able to handle it overlooks the fact that the parent didn't provide the necessary skills. So, the parent is at fault for not teaching and not offering a solution. The kid's anger is a reaction to the lack of support. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014the kid is not in the wrong.\n"
