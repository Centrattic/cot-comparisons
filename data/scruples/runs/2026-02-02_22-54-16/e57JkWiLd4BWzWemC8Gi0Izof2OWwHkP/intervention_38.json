My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid is 17, can't cook much, and after coming home late from school, the mom tells them to make their own dinner. The kid argues that they can't cook and the mom says they should figure it out, even pointing out their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The kid gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the responsibilities. At 17, you'd expect some independence, but cooking isn't something everyone learns naturally. The mom didn't teach them, and now expects them to figure it out. That might be a problem because she didn't provide the necessary skills. The kid is frustrated because they're hungry and can't cook, which is a basic need. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help. The sister being able to cook at 14 suggests the kid is being left behind, which is unfair.\n\nBut the kid did get home late from school, so maybe they were tired. The mom's refusal to take them to the store even though they can't drive adds to the problem. The kid is in a situation where they're not equipped to handle cooking, and the mom isn't stepping in to teach them. So the kid's anger is understandable. They're not asking for a full meal, just help or resources. The kid's frustration is valid because they're left without options. The mom's approach might be neglecting her responsibility to teach the child life skills. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
