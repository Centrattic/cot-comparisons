My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who's upset because their mom didn't cook dinner and expects them to make something they can't. The author can't cook because their mom never taught them, and even their younger sister, who's 14, was taught. The mom doesn't want to drive them to the store, and the author got mad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 17, still pretty young, and their mom hasn't taught them to cook. They tried to make dinner but couldn't. The mom's response was to tell them to figure it out, which might be reasonable if the kid had the means, but they don't. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for getting angry.\n\nOn one hand, the mom might be trying to teach independence, but if she never taught them how to cook, expecting them to just figure it out without support could be unreasonable. The fact that the sister was taught suggests that the mom is capable of teaching but hasn't done so for the author. Also, the author can't drive, so they can't get ingredients themselves. The mom's refusal to help might leave the author without dinner, which is a basic need.\n\nOn the other hand, a 17-year-old should be learning life skills. The mom might be trying to push them to become more self-sufficient, even if it's frustrating. However, the key point is that the author wasn't given the necessary tools or teaching. The mom's response seems dismissive and unhelpful, especially when the author is genuinely struggling.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's approach is flawed because she didn't provide the necessary skills or support. The author is reacting to being left hungry without the means to help themselves. The anger comes from being in a situation where their needs aren't met despite the mom's knowledge of their inability to cook. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
