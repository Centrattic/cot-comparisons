My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom never taught them. They only know basic stuff like ramen. They stayed late at school working on prom decorations and expected dinner. When they got home, their mom told them to find something to cook themselves. The author tried to explain they can't cook, their mom said they're old enough to figure it out, mentioned the 14-year-old sister who can cook, and refused to take them to the store. The author got angry and went to their room.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's inability to cook despite their age, the mother's refusal to help, and the expectation that a 17-year-old should be able to cook. The author feels wronged because they weren't taught and are left hungry. The mother might think the child is being lazy or should be responsible.\n\nBut wait, is it fair for the mom not to teach? At 17, maybe it's time, but if the mom never taught them, that's an issue. Also, the sister is younger but was taught, which adds to the author's frustration. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author asked for help, like driving to the store, but the mom refused. That could make the mom not fully responsible for the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should try to learn cooking instead of expecting the mom to always provide. But the problem is the mom never taught them, so the author isn't in the wrong for not knowing. They tried to communicate their inability, and the mom didn't offer support. So the author's anger is justified because they were left in a difficult situation without resources. The mom's response seems harsh. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
