My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook much, and after a long day at school, expected dinner but their mom told them to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. At 17, many teens still rely on their parents for meals. The mom might think the child should start being more independent, but the author has never been taught. The mom mentions the 14-year-old sister who can cook, which the author points out was because the mom actually taught her. The author is asking for help, like being driven to buy food they can cook, but the mom refuses. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They can't cook, haven't been taught, and now are left without dinner after a long day. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering any help. The author's anger comes from feeling unsupported and unprepared. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Probably not. They\u2019re in a situation where they\u2019re expected to handle something they weren\u2019t taught. The mom\u2019s approach might be trying to teach independence, but without the necessary skills or support. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
