My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook beyond a few simple things, and after a long day at school, expected dinner but mom said they should figure it out. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since the author has never been taught. The sister is 14 and can cook, but the author can't drive. The author feels frustrated and hungry, leading to the argument.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're a teenager who hasn't been taught essential life skills. They worked late and just want a meal. The mom's refusal to help or provide guidance seems unfair, especially since she didn't teach them. The fact that the sister was taught but the author wasn't adds to the frustration. The author is asking for help, not being unreasonable.\n\nMom's perspective: She might see the author as needing to become independent. At 17, she might think it's time they start learning. But the key issue is that the author wasn't taught. If she didn't teach them, expecting them to suddenly figure it out without support isn't fair. Also, the sister was taught, so the double standard is an issue here.\n\nSocietal expectations: Parents are generally expected to teach their children basic life skills. If a parent hasn't done that, the child isn't in the wrong for being upset when they can't meet expectations. The author's anger stems from unmet needs and lack of support, not entitlement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're reacting to a situation where they weren't given the tools to be independent. The mom should have taught them cooking earlier. The author's frustration is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
