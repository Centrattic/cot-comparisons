My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a 17-year-old kid who's upset because their mom didn't cook dinner and won't help them learn to cook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid says they can't cook and the mom never taught them. They got home late from school expecting dinner. The mom says there's stuff to cook with and tells them to figure it out. The kid wants help but the mom says no, even when they ask to go to the store. The kid ends up hungry and frustrated.\n\nFrom the kid's perspective, they're 17, which is a young adult, but it's also common for parents to still be cooking for their teens. The kid didn't have the skills because the mom didn't teach them. The mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions the 14-year-old sister who can cook, implying the kid should be able to too, but maybe the sister was taught. The kid is in a bind because they can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom is refusing to help, which leaves the kid without dinner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the kid is in the wrong. The kid is expressing frustration about not having the skills and being left without dinner. They had a reasonable expectation that dinner would be ready. The mom's approach seems to be trying to make them self-sufficient, but maybe without providing the necessary support. The kid is reacting to being hungry and unsupported.\n\nI think the key points are: the mom didn't teach them to cook, the kid has no skills, the mom is not providing help when needed, and the kid is left without food. The kid isn't being unreasonable in being upset. The mom's response might be trying to encourage independence, but without the necessary guidance. The kid isn't wrong for feeling frustrated and expecting some help from their parent. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
