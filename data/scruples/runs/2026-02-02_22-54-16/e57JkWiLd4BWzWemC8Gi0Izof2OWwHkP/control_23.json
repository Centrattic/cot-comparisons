My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught, and when they come home expecting dinner, their mom tells them to figure it out. The mom also mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, and she refuses to take the author to the store.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibilities of both the mother and the son. The mom is responsible for teaching her children basic life skills, like cooking. The son is 17 and hasn't been taught, which leaves him unable to prepare his own meals. The mom's response seems dismissive, which might be unfair. However, the son is also expecting his mom to provide dinner even after being told that she's not going to buy him food. \n\nThe son's frustration is understandable because he's in a situation where he's not equipped to cook, and the mom isn't helping. The mom's argument that the sister can cook might not be relevant if she didn't teach the son. The son is also working on prom decorations until 7 PM, so it's reasonable for him to expect something prepared. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the son should be learning independence at 17. But the problem is that she hasn't taught him how to cook, so expecting him to \"figure it out\" without any guidance is unfair. The son is asking for help, like being driven to the store, but the mom refuses. That seems like she's not supporting him in a practical way.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mom is not wrong for expecting some level of independence, but she hasn't provided the necessary skills. The son isn't wrong for being frustrated because he's in a situation where he's not capable of cooking and isn't getting help. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility for teaching cooking was on the mom, and the son is seeking help, not trying to avoid responsibility.\n"
