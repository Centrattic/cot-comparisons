My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the kid is 17 and can't cook anything beyond basic stuff like ramen. The mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to cook. The kid comes home expecting dinner, but the mom says to \"get creative.\" The kid can't cook, so they argue, and the mom mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The kid wants to go to the store but can't drive, and the mom refuses.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The kid's perspective: they're relying on their mom because they weren't taught skills. They worked late on prom decorations, so maybe they expected dinner. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, even if it's hard. But also, not providing food when there's no one to cook it might be an issue.\n\nIs the kid in the wrong for getting mad? Well, they have a valid point about not being taught. But maybe they should have planned ahead or asked earlier. The mom might be in a position where she's not able to cook, or maybe she's trying to push the kid to learn. However, the kid can't cook and can't drive, so the mom's refusal to help is problematic. \n\nAlso, the sister is younger but already knows how to cook. The mom might be inconsistent. The kid's frustration is understandable. Being hungry after working late and not having dinner options could make anyone upset. The mom's response might be dismissive, not considering the kid's lack of skills. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for getting mad. They have valid reasons. The mom's approach is flawed because she didn't teach them and isn't offering help now. The answer would be B (No).\n"
