My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who's upset with their mom for not cooking dinner, even though they can't cook themselves. The mom didn't teach them and now expects them to figure it out. The kid tried to ask for help but the mom refused, even though the sister (14) was taught. The kid then gets angry and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The kid is 17, which is considered an adult in many contexts, but they haven't been taught how to cook. The mom's response seems to be that it's now the kid's responsibility, but there's a history of not teaching them. The sister, who's younger, was taught, which implies the mom is capable of teaching but didn't do so for the older child. \n\nThe kid worked late on prom decorations, expected dinner, and when it wasn't there, they were met with resistance. The mom's refusal to help or support, despite the kid's inability to cook, might be the root issue here. The kid's frustration is valid because they've been left without necessary skills. The argument is about responsibility\u2014did the mom fail to provide the necessary guidance, making the kid's anger justified?\n\nAlso, the mom's response to the sister being able to cook but the older child not being taught could indicate favoritism or inconsistency. The kid's request to be driven to the store was denied, leaving them without food. The kid's anger stems from feeling unsupported and unprepared. \n\nIs the kid in the wrong for being upset? Maybe not. They had a legitimate need and the parent didn't fulfill it by either cooking or providing the means to cook. The mom's actions (or inactions) led to the situation. The kid's reaction, though maybe intense, is a response to being left without resources. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the kid not being in the wrong. The mom didn't teach them, refused help, and the kid is expressing justified frustration. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
