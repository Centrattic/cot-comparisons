My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them being 17, not knowing how to cook, and getting angry at their mom for not preparing dinner. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they can't cook because their mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn. They come home from school late, expecting dinner, but the mom says they should figure it out. The author argues that they can't, and the mom points out their 14-year-old sister can cook. The author is trying to get the mom to drive them to the store, but she refuses. The author then goes to their room in frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, at 17, some might think they should be more independent. But the mom didn't teach them to cook and also doesn't trust them to drive. The author is left without options. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering support. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and not having resources to fix the problem. The mom's sister can cook because she was taught. The author is in a situation where they can't cook, can't drive, and the mom won't help. The author's frustration is understandable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
