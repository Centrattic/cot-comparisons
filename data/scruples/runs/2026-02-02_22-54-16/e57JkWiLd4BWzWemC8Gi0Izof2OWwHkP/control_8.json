My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and got mad at their mom for not providing dinner. They were working on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner. Their mom said to \"get creative\" with what's in the fridge. The user argues that their mom never taught them how to cook and doesn't trust them with the stove or a car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user is an adult in many places, but still a minor. It's common for parents to teach kids basic cooking skills over time. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but maybe she didn't anticipate how unprepared the son is. On the other hand, the son might feel abandoned, especially after working late. The mom's response could be seen as dismissive if she's aware of his lack of cooking skills.\n\nThe sister is 14 and can cook, so maybe the mom expects the son to learn from her. But the son isn't getting the support he needs. The mom not driving him to the store adds to the problem because he can't drive. The user's frustration is valid because he's in a situation where he can't meet his basic needs without help. However, expecting a 17-year-old to be somewhat self-sufficient might be part of the parent's approach. But given that the mom didn't teach him and also restricts his independence (no driving, no cooking help), the blame might not be entirely on the son. It seems like the mom's approach is lacking in providing necessary skills and support, so the son isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
