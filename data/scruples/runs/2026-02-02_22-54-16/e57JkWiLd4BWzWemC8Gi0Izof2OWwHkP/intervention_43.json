My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 17, can't cook much except some simple stuff like ramen. Their mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to cook on their own. The author had a long day at school working on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner. Instead, the mom said they should figure it out, even though the author can't cook. The mom also mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook and that they have ingredients to use. The author is frustrated and asks to be driven to the store, but the mom refuses. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's inability to cook due to lack of teaching, the expectation of dinner after a long day, and the mom's refusal to help. The author is upset because they can't cook and the mom isn't providing support despite knowing the author's limitations.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The mom's response might seem reasonable if the author could cook, but since they explicitly state they can't and the mom never taught them, it's a bit different. The author's frustration stems from being unprepared and not having the support they need. The mom's argument that the sister can cook doesn't address the author's inability. Also, the mom's refusal to drive them to buy food when they can't cook complicates things further.\n\nFrom a perspective of responsibility, the mom might have a responsibility to ensure her child is fed, especially if they lack the skills. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner despite their limitations. However, the author could have managed expectations by communicating earlier or bringing food from school. But given the situation, the mom's response seems dismissive of the author's actual inability to cook, which the author clearly communicated.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the mom didn't prepare them to cook, and the situation is a result of the mom's lack of support. The frustration is justified given the circumstances.\n"
