My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they came home late from school, their mom didn't have dinner ready. The mom told the author to just figure it out, but the author feels it's their mom's responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is still a teenager, so there's an expectation that parents provide meals. However, the mom might be trying to teach independence by letting the author learn to cook. But the author can't cook anything beyond simple things like ramen. The mom also mentions that the author's 14-year-old sister can cook, which might be a point of comparison. However, if the mom actually taught the sister and not the author, that's a problem. The author asked for help, like driving to the store, but the mom refused. \n\nThe author's anger comes from hunger and feeling unsupported. The mom's response seems dismissive. At 17, expecting a teenager to cook without any training isn't fair. The mom has a responsibility to provide meals unless the child is being taught to cook. The argument leads to the author being upset and going to their room. \n\nConsidering cultural norms and typical parental responsibilities, parents usually provide meals or teach their children to cook. The mom here isn't doing either. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The mom is the one who didn't prepare dinner and didn't support the author when they asked for help. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
