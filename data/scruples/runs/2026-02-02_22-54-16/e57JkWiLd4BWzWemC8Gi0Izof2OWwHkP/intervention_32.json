My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and can't cook. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to cook on their own. They came home from school at 7 PM expecting dinner, but their mom said to make something themselves. They tried to explain they can't cook, but the mom was dismissive, mentioning their 14-year-old sister who can make her own dinner. The user asked to be driven to the store for something they can cook, but the mom refused.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The user's situation is that they're over 17 and haven't been taught basic cooking skills. They have a valid reason to be frustrated because their mom hasn't provided the necessary support. The mom's response seems to be expecting the user to solve the problem without the skills they don't have. The sister is 14 and can cook, so maybe the mom is inconsistent in her approach. The user's anger stems from not being prepared for independence in this area. The mom's refusal to help them get food they can cook is part of the issue here. The user is in a tough spot because they're expected to be responsible for themselves but haven't been given the tools. The argument isn't about being a brat but about not receiving necessary education. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
