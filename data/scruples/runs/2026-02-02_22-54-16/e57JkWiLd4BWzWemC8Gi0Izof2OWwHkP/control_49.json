My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and got mad at their mom for not preparing dinner. The mom says there's plenty of stuff to cook with and tells them to get creative, but the author can't use the stove properly and the sister, who is younger, was taught how to cook.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The author is 17 and hasn't learned to cook, which might be a common issue in some families. The mom's response seems to be pushing the author to take responsibility, but the author feels unsupported because they weren't taught. The mom mentions the sister, who is 14, can make her own dinner. That might indicate the mom has been teaching the younger sibling, which could make the older child feel neglected. \n\nThe author's anger comes from being unprepared and hungry after a long day at school. They asked for help or a ride to buy something they could cook, but the mom refused. The key points here are the lack of cooking skills due to not being taught, the expectation to use available resources, and the comparison to the younger sister. \n\nIn some perspectives, a 17-year-old should be learning life skills like cooking, so the author might be expected to take initiative or ask for lessons earlier. However, the mom hasn't provided any cooking education, and the author's request for assistance (like a store ride) was denied. The mom's insistence on the author figuring it out could be seen as not supporting them adequately. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they were left without dinner and haven't been given the tools to prepare it. The mom's response might be considered harsh, especially since the author is still dependent on her for meals. Comparing to the younger sister, who was actually taught, could add to that feeling of neglect. \n\nSo the answer would hinge on whether the mom's refusal to help is unreasonable given the lack of prior teaching. If the author wasn't taught, then the mom might be in the wrong for expecting them to suddenly cook without support. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and hungry, which is understandable. The correct response here is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
