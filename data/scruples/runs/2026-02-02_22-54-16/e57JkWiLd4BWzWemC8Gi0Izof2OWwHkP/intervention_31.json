My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom didn't teach them. They come home late from school expecting dinner, but their mom won't help, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The mom didn't teach her child to cook, even though the kid is 17. That's a common age when parents might expect children to learn basic life skills. But the mom also didn't provide dinner, even though there's food available. The kid is hungry and frustrated because they can't cook. The mom's response is dismissive, comparing them to their 14-year-old sister who was taught how to cook.\n\nThe kid's anger stems from being unprepared and not having the necessary skills. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store or help them find a solution adds to the problem. The kid is in a tough spot because they can't cook and can't drive, so their options are limited. The question is whether the kid is in the wrong for getting mad.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mom might be at fault for not teaching the child to cook earlier, leaving them in a situation where they can't provide for themselves. The kid's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The mom's dismissive attitude and lack of support contribute to the conflict. The kid isn't demanding an unreasonable amount; they're asking for basic help like being driven to buy something simple to cook. The fact that the mom has food in the house but isn't offering to prepare it is part of the issue.\n\nHowever, the kid is 17 and could be expected to start learning some basic cooking skills. That said, the mom's responsibility to provide for her child's needs, especially when the child has been neglected in terms of learning these skills, might mean the mom is at fault. The kid's anger isn't unreasonable given the lack of support and preparation from the parent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The mom's failure to teach cooking and her unhelpful response are the main issues here. The kid's frustration is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
