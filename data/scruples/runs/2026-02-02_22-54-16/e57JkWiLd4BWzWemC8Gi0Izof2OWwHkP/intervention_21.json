My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and can't cook anything except a few simple things. Their mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. They worked late on school stuff and expected dinner, but their mom said they should figure it out. The mom even mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, which the author points out that the mom actually taught the sister. The author asked to be driven to the store but was denied. They got fed up and went to their room.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are that the author can't cook due to mom's lack of teaching, expected a dinner after working late, and mom isn't providing support. The author's frustration is justified because they haven't been taught skills necessary for independent living, which is a parent's responsibility. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful, especially when the author is clearly in a difficult spot. The author asking for help (going to the store) is reasonable, but the mom refused. So the responsibility lies more with the mom for not teaching and not supporting the child's needs. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and unsupported. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
