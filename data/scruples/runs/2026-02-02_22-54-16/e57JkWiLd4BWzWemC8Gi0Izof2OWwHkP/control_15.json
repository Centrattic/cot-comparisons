My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the kid getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the kid is 17 and can't cook much besides some simple things. The mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to teach themselves. The kid comes home from school working on prom stuff until 7, expecting dinner, but the mom says they should just find something to cook. The kid points out they can't cook, and the mom says they should figure it out, even mentioning their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The kid asks to be driven to the store to buy something they can cook, but the mom says no. The kid gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nSo, the kid's perspective is that they were left hungry because they can't cook and the mom didn't help. The mom's perspective is that the kid is old enough to figure it out, even though she didn't teach them. The kid might feel it's unfair that they can't cook and the mom isn't supporting them. The mom might think the kid should be more responsible.\n\nIs the kid in the wrong? Well, they are 17, which is considered almost an adult. Arguably, they should be learning to cook on their own. But the mom never taught them, and there's a history of not trusting them. The kid is working on school activities, which is responsible. They asked for help, and the mom refused. The kid's frustration is understandable because they're hungry and don't know how to fix the situation. The mom might not realize how dependent the kid is on her for meals. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kid should have planned ahead or tried to learn cooking earlier. But the mom's refusal to drive them to the store when they asked is a barrier. The fact that the sister can cook might make the kid feel left out or not supported. The mom's response seems dismissive, which could be why the kid got upset. \n\nSo, considering all that, the kid isn't necessarily at fault. They're in a situation where they lack a skill the mom expects them to have, without being taught. The mom's not helping when the kid asks for assistance. So the answer might be B, the kid isn't in the wrong.\n"
