My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 17, can't cook and didn't get dinner because their mom told them to figure it out. The author is upset about not having dinner after being home late from school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and responsibilities. The author is 17, which is a teenager, but still pretty young. They mention they can't cook anything beyond a few simple items. The mom hasn't taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove. The sister, who's 14, is making her own dinner, which might imply that the mom is expecting the older child to do the same, but the author isn't capable. \n\nThe author worked until 7 PM and came home expecting dinner. When they didn't find it, they asked, and the mom said to use what's available. The author tried to explain they can't cook, and the mom insists they should figure it out. The author can't drive, so they can't go to the store, and the mom won't help. This leads to an argument and the author being hungry.\n\nNow, the key points here: The mom hasn't taught the author cooking skills, which is a problem if the author isn't able to fend for themselves. The author is relying on the mom for meals, which they might expect since they haven't been taught. The mom's response seems to be pushing responsibility onto the author, but without the necessary skills or support. \n\nBut at 17, some might argue that the author should be starting to learn life skills. However, if the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove, it's a bit of a catch-22. The author isn't being unreasonable in expecting dinner, especially after working late. The mom's refusal to help get food or teach is part of the issue. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're left hungry and without a way to get food, which is a basic need. The mom's expectation that they can \"figure it out\" without prior instruction might be unfair. Also, the sister being 14 and cooking might be because the mom did teach her, which the author is pointing out as a difference in treatment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're in a situation where they haven't been given the tools to be independent, and the mom isn't providing support. The author's anger comes from being left without a clear solution to their hunger after being expected to handle something they can't. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
