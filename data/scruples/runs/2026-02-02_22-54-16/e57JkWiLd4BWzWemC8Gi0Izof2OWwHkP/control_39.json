My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the 17-year-old is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook, hasn't been taught, and after coming home from school, expected dinner. The mom says \"Whatever you can find\" and when the kid says they can't cook, the mom says they should figure it out, referencing their 14-year sister who can cook. The kid wants to go to the store but the mom won't drive them. The kid gets frustrated and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, the kid's age is 17. At that age, it's reasonable for parents to start teaching life skills, including cooking. However, the mom never taught the kid, which is a problem. If the kid hasn't been taught, expecting them to suddenly cook without help is unfair. The mom mentions the sister can cook, but that's her responsibility. The kid is in a bind because they can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom's response seems dismissive. The kid's frustration is understandable. They worked on prom till 7 PM and then are expected to cook without prior training. The mom isn't providing support. So the kid isn't in the wrong for being upset. The mom's lack of support and teaching is the issue here. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
