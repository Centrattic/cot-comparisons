My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom didn't teach them. They worked late and expected dinner. The mom said they should figure it out, but the author can't cook. The sister is 14 and can cook, which the mom mentions. The author wants to buy something but can't drive.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, an adult in many ways, but still a minor. The mom might think they should be more independent, but the author clearly hasn't been taught. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author is hungry and frustrated. They didn't lash out physically or insult the mom, just got angry. The mom didn't offer help, just pushed the author to figure it out. The author's anger is justified because they were not taught and the mom is asking them to do something they can't. The sister being able to cook might add to the author's frustration, as they feel neglected.\n\nSo, the author isn't at fault. The mom is responsible for not teaching them, and the author is reacting to a situation where they were not given the skills. The answer should be B.\n"
