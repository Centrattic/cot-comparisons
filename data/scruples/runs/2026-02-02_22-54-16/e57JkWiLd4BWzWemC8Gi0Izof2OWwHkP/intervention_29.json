My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author can't cook, hasn't been taught by their mom, and after a long day, came home expecting dinner. The mom didn't cook and instead told them to figure it out. The author got upset and asked if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author is 17, which is a teenager. At that age, some level of independence is expected, but cooking isn't something everyone learns at home. The mom never taught them, and even mentions the sister was taught. The author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. They're trying to make a grilled cheese, which is basic, but the mom is resistant.\n\nThe key points here are that the mom didn't teach them to cook, didn't provide support when asked, and the son is left hungry. The mom's response seems dismissive. The son's frustration is understandable because they've been set up to fail. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old can suddenly figure it out without prior instruction is unrealistic. The sister being 14 and able to cook adds to the son's argument that he's being neglected in learning basic life skills.\n\nThe author's anger stems from being left without dinner despite not having the skills to make it themselves. The mom isn't providing help, which could be seen as neglecting her responsibility as a parent. The author isn't in the wrong for getting upset because the situation is unfair. They're asking for help, but the mom isn't offering it, and the son is left hungry. The author's request for detailed instructions shows they're trying to solve the problem, not just being a brat.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
