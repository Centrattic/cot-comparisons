My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17, can't cook, and their mom hasn't taught them. They got home expecting dinner, but mom said they should figure it out. The user is upset because they can't cook and feel like the mom isn't helping. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially when she mentions the sister can cook.\n\nFirst, the mom's responsibility: At 17, most parents would expect their child to be learning life skills, including cooking. If the mom never taught them, that's part of the issue. She might have failed to prepare them. But the user is also 17, so maybe they should take some responsibility for not learning earlier. However, the situation is that the mom is now refusing help, even to go to the store, which the user can't drive. \n\nThe user's anger is understandable. They're hungry, overworked from school, and the mom isn't providing support. The mom's argument that the sister can cook and they have the ingredients might not account for the user's lack of skills. Also, the mom's refusal to drive them to buy something they can cook is a barrier. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They expressed frustration, which is normal. But getting mad might be justified given the mom's lack of support. However, maybe they should have communicated better earlier. But given the circumstances, the mom's actions seem neglectful. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The mom is more at fault here for not teaching and not helping now.\n"
