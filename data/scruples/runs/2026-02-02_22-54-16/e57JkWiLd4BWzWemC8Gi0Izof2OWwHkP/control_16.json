My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author, who is 17, getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught by their mom. They came home late after school work and expected dinner. The mom didn't prepare anything and suggested the author cook themselves. The author feels frustrated because they can't cook, and the mom is unhelpful, even bringing up the sister who is younger but can cook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is considered a teenager. At that age, some level of independence is expected, but cooking isn't something everyone learns. The author is clear that the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to cook. They're asking if they're in the wrong for getting mad. \n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. She tells the author to \"get creative\" and points out that the sister made her own dinner. However, the sister is 14 and was taught by the mom, implying that the author wasn't. The mom also refuses to help by driving them to the store, which the author can't do themselves. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're in a situation where they can't prepare a meal, and their mom isn't providing support. The author is working on school projects, which is a responsible thing. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old should be able to cook without prior teaching might be unrealistic. \n\nBut at the same time, 17 is an age where some level of self-sufficiency is expected. The author could be expected to find a solution, like using the internet for instructions, but they might not know how. However, the mom's refusal to help exacerbates the problem. \n\nThe key points are: the mom never taught them, the author can't cook, and the mom isn't providing support. The author's anger comes from being unprepared and unsupported. The mom's response is dismissive and doesn't address the lack of skills. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being frustrated. Their situation is a result of the mom not teaching them, and the mom's response is unhelpful. So the answer is B (No).\n"
