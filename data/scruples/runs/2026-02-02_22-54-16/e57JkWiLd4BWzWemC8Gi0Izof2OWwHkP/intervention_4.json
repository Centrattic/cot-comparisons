My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they came home expecting dinner, the mom said to figure it out. The author got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught cooking skills. Their mom didn't teach them and now expects them to handle dinner. At 17, it's reasonable for parents to start teaching life skills, but if the mom never taught them, that's on her. The author is asking for help, but the mom refuses, even though the sister was taught. The author is hungry, tired from school, and frustrated. \n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. Saying \"you can figure it out\" when the child hasn't been taught is not helpful. The fact that the sister was taught shows inconsistency. The author's anger is understandable given the lack of support. The mom not helping them buy food when they can't drive also adds to the problem. The author isn't being a brat here; they're in a situation where they need assistance but aren't getting it. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
