My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to make it themselves. The author is frustrated because they can't, and the mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and responsibility. At 17, there's an expectation to be more independent, but cooking isn't something everyone learns, especially if parents don't teach. The mom's response seems dismissive. She's not providing support, which is part of the problem. The sister is 14 and was taught, so the author feels neglected. The mom also refuses to drive them to buy food, which adds to the frustration.\n\nThe author's anger is about being left without dinner when they can't cook. They asked for help, which was denied. The mom's response is to push responsibility onto the child without equipping them with the necessary skills. That's a common issue in parent-child dynamics where expectations don't match reality. The author isn't wrong for being upset when their needs aren't met despite their efforts to communicate. The mom's failure to teach and support is a bigger issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
