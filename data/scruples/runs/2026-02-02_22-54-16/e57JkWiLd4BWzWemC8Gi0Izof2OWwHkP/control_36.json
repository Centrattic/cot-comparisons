My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, hasn't been taught by their mom, and after coming home late from school, expects dinner but is told to figure it out. The mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can cook, and refuses to help or drive them to the store. The author then goes to their room, is hungry, and asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The mom's perspective: she might be trying to teach responsibility, encourage independence. But the author is 17, which is still pretty young. If the mom never taught them how to cook and also doesn't trust them with a car, then expecting them to handle dinner might be unreasonable. The author is clearly frustrated because they lack the skills and resources. The mom's response to the sister being able to cook might be a way to pressure the author, but if the author wasn't taught, that's a problem. Also, not driving them to buy something they can cook adds to the issue. The author is in a situation where they can't meet the expectation because the necessary skills and resources weren't provided. So, the mom might be at fault for not preparing them for this responsibility. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner when they're not equipped to handle it. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were set up to fail without proper support. Answer B.\n"
