My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person is 17, can't cook much, and after a long day at school expecting dinner, their mom tells them to figure it out. The mom mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, and refuses to drive them to the store.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is 17, hasn't been taught to cook by their mom, and is now expected to make dinner themselves. The mom isn't helping, and the author is frustrated. They argue, then go to their room hungry.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They can't cook because the mom didn't teach them. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but if they weren't taught, it's not their fault. They worked on prom until 7, so maybe they were tired and hungry. The mom's response seems dismissive. \n\nThe mom's perspective: She might think the child is old enough to learn, especially since the sister (14) can do it. However, the sister was taught by the mom, while the author wasn't. The mom refuses to help them get ingredients and isn't providing a solution.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? They were expecting dinner because maybe that's the norm in their household. When the mom doesn't provide, and doesn't offer help, the frustration is valid. The author isn't asking for a meal, just some guidance or support. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store when they can't drive themselves adds to the problem.\n\nThe author's anger comes from feeling unsupported and unprepared. The mom didn't teach them or provide the means to cook. So the author's reaction seems understandable. They're not in the wrong for being upset. The mom is the one who didn't equip them with necessary skills. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
