My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the kid can't cook because their mom never taught them. They mention being 17 and only able to make a few simple things. They worked late on school stuff and expected dinner. Mom didn't have anything prepared and said they should figure it out. The kid points out they can't use the stove properly, and even their younger sister was taught. Mom refused to take them to the store. The kid got upset and went to their room.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The key points are that the mom didn't teach them cooking, didn't trust them with the stove, and didn't support them when needed. The kid is in a situation where they're not equipped to handle cooking on their own. The mom's response seems dismissive. The kid's frustration is understandable because they have no resources to make dinner. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
