My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The story is from a 17-year-old who can't cook and their mom didn't teach them. The mom expects them to figure it out, but the kid can't even use the stove properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The mom is the parent, so teaching life skills like cooking is part of parenting. If the mom never taught the child and also doesn't trust them to learn on their own, that's a problem. The kid is 17, but not all teens are taught to cook by their parents. However, the parent might argue that the child should take initiative.\n\nThe child came home expecting dinner, which is reasonable. The mom's response was to tell them to \"get creative,\" but the child isn't capable. The mom also mentions the 14-year-old sister who can cook, but that doesn't mean the older child should be expected to do the same if they weren't taught. The parent's refusal to help or buy food when they have it at home could be seen as not supporting the child's needs.\n\nThe child's frustration is understandable because they're hungry and the parent isn't providing for their basic needs. The argument that the child should have learned earlier is valid, but the parent is responsible for teaching them. The child isn't being unreasonable in wanting to know how to cook, especially since the parent hasn't provided that education.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The parent failed to teach necessary skills and isn't supporting the child now. The answer should be B.\n"
