My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook, the mom didn't teach them, and when they come home, the mom tells them to figure it out. The kid gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The kid's perspective is that they were hungry after school, expected dinner, and their mom didn't provide it. They can't cook, and the mom never taught them. The mom's response was to tell them to be creative and mention that their sister, who's 14, can cook. The kid then asks to be driven to the store, but the mom refuses. The kid feels wronged and seeks validation.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective might be that the kid is old enough to learn basic cooking skills. Maybe she expected the kid to take initiative, even if they were not fully skilled. The fact that the sister, who's younger, can cook might be a point the mom uses to argue that the kid should be able to as well. The mom also mentions they have food in the house, so maybe she thought the kid could manage with what's there.\n\nNow, considering social norms and typical parenting practices, it's common for parents to encourage kids to become more independent as they get older. However, expecting a 17-year-old to suddenly start cooking without any prior instruction might be unrealistic. The kid's frustration is valid because they were set up without the necessary skills. The mom's refusal to help get food, even though they have the means, might be seen as not addressing the immediate need for food, especially after a long day.\n\nThe kid's anger might be seen as justified because they were left without options and hungry. The mom's lack of support in teaching basic skills could contribute to the kid's stress. However, the kid could have tried to communicate their needs more effectively or asked for specific help earlier. The mom might feel that the kid is being overly dependent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid is at an age where learning life skills is important, but the parent also has a role in facilitating that learning. If the mom never taught them, maybe she's also at fault for not recognizing the need to provide that education. The kid's anger stems from being unprepared and now facing the consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the kid isn't entirely in the wrong. The mom's approach might have been harsh, especially given the lack of prior teaching. The kid's frustration is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
