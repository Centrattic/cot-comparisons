My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who can't cook because their mom never taught them. They got home expecting dinner, but the mom said to \"get creative\" and mentioned that the 14-year-old sister can cook. The author got mad because they can't cook and tried to ask for help but didn't get any.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager, but still young. Not knowing how to cook might be a problem if they're expected to be more independent. However, the mom might have a point in expecting them to learn, but the key issue here is that the mom didn't teach them. The author's frustration is valid because they were left without dinner and didn't have the skills to fix it. The mom's response seems dismissive, not helping even when the author asked to be driven to the store. The sister being 14 and able to cook suggests that the mom did teach her, leaving the older child without the same support. That's a bit unfair. The author's anger is a reaction to being ignored when they needed help. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were left without options and their mom didn't provide the necessary teaching or support. The mom's behavior here is probably the main issue. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
