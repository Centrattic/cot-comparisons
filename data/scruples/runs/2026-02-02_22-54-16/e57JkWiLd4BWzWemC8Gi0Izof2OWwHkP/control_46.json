My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is the author, a 17-year-old, is upset because their mom didn't cook dinner and instead told them to figure it out. The author can't cook, hasn't been taught, and relies on pre-made stuff. The mom's response was to tell them to get creative, and even mentions the 14-year-old sister who can cook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught basic cooking skills. They were working on prom and expected dinner. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but maybe not considering the child's lack of skills. The mom also doesn't trust the author to drive, so can't just go to the store. The author is hungry and frustrated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did get angry. But is that justified? If they were never taught and the mom is now expecting them to do something they can't, maybe the parent is at fault for not teaching earlier. However, the author is 17, so some might expect more responsibility. But cooking is a basic life skill, and if the parent hasn't taught it, the kid isn't at fault for not knowing. The mom's response of \"figure it out\" might be unreasonable here. The author is also working on school stuff, so expecting them to cook when they can't is tough.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have planned ahead. If they knew they'd be home at 7, maybe they should have microwavable meals. But the mom has the resources to cook and didn't, so maybe the parent is responsible for feeding them until they can cook. The author's anger might be a symptom of the parent not providing necessary skills. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're a kid who was never taught and is being pushed to do something they can't. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
