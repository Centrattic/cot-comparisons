My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner because they can't cook themselves. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond basic stuff like ramen and mac and cheese. The mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. The author comes home after working on prom decorations and expects dinner, but the mom tells them to figure it out. The author argues they can't cook, and the mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can, implying they should learn. The author asks to be driven to the store, but the mom refuses. The argument escalates, the author goes to their room, and is still hungry hours later.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught essential life skills like cooking by their parent. It's reasonable for them to expect some support, especially after a long day at school. However, the author is 17, which is an age where some level of independence is expected. The mom might feel like it's time the child starts learning to manage on their own. But the key points here are that the mom never taught them and continues to refuse help. The author's frustration is understandable because they're hungry, overworked, and feel unsupported. The mom's response is dismissive and unhelpful, especially since the author has valid limitations. The sister being able to cook doesn't mean the author should be expected to do the same without teaching. The argument arises from the mom not providing the necessary instruction and refusing assistance when asked. So, the author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and unsupported. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong because the parent hasn't fulfilled their role in teaching essential skills. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
