My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they came home expecting dinner, their mom told them to figure it out. They argued, and the author went to their room. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17 and hasn't been taught to cook. That's a bit old for a parent not to have started teaching basic cooking skills. The mom might feel that the child is being too dependent or not trying. However, the mom also didn't teach the author and now expects them to handle cooking at 17 without any instruction. That seems like a problem. Also, the author mentions that their sister, who is 14, was taught to cook. So there's some inconsistency here. The mom is dismissing the author's inability to cook and not offering help, even when the author asked for assistance, like driving them to the store, which the mom refused. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They worked late and expected dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive and not supportive. The author isn't asking for a full meal, just something they can cook, like a grilled cheese. The mom's refusal to even drive them to buy pre-made ingredients adds to the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be trying to push her child to become more independent. But if she never taught them how, then expecting them to just figure it out is unrealistic. There's also the sister comparison\u2014she was taught, the author wasn't. That could be a point where the mom is being unfair. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They have a valid complaint. The mom failed to provide necessary skills and support. The author's anger stems from not being prepared for independence. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
