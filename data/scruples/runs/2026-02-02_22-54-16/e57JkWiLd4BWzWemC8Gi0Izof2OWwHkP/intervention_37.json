My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and got mad at their mom for not providing dinner. The mom said to use the available ingredients and mentioned their 14-year-old sister who can cook.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and hasn't been taught how to cook. They listed some basic foods they can make, but nothing more complex. The mom didn't teach them, yet expects them to figure it out. The author tried to ask for a ride to buy food but was denied. They ended up hungry and frustrated.\n\nI need to consider if the author is at fault. The key points are the lack of cooking skills due to no prior teaching, the mom's expectation without support, and the sister being taught at a younger age. The author's anger seems justified because they were left without dinner despite being unable to prepare it themselves. The mom didn't offer help or alternatives. The sister being older but already knowing how to cook adds to the unfairness, as the author wasn't given the same opportunity.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to be upset since they weren't taught and their request for help was refused. The mom's response was dismissive, not providing support. The author's frustration is understandable.\n"
