My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author is 17, can't cook anything beyond ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. They came home from school working on prom until 7 PM expecting dinner. Their mom said to find something to cook, but the author can't cook. They tried to explain they weren't taught, and the mom said they should figure it out. The author asked for a ride to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused. The author got mad and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age. 17 is still a minor in most places, so they might not be expected to be fully independent yet. The mom hasn't taught them how to cook, which is a problem. Also, there's a sister who is 14 who was taught cooking, which highlights the inconsistency. The author can't drive, so the mom isn't letting them go to the store either. The author is hungry, frustrated, and just wants food. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they were left in a situation where they can't meet their basic need for dinner. The mom isn't providing support or alternatives. The author asked for help (ride to store), which was denied. The mom's response seems dismissive, not helpful. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to handle it more calmly? However, considering their age and lack of cooking skills, getting mad might be a reaction to being ignored. The title makes them sound like a brat, but the details show a lack of support from the parent. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not being given the necessary skills or resources to handle the situation. The mom is responsible for their well-being, especially since they're still under 18. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
