My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA question) is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is 17, can't cook, and gets angry at their mom for not preparing dinner. The mom insists the author should figure it out themselves or use the existing ingredients.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, which is a minor, and the fact that they can't cook anything beyond a few instant meals. The mom hasn't taught them, and when asked, she doesn't help. The sister, who's 14, is able to cook, implying the mom taught her. The author works on prom decorations until 7 PM, comes home expecting dinner, but gets told to make their own. The author feels frustrated, hungry, and doesn't know how to cook, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics, parents are generally responsible for feeding their children until a certain age. At 17, while some might start cooking for themselves, it's still common for parents to prepare meals. The mom's response seems dismissive and doesn't offer support, especially when the author can't drive and lacks cooking skills. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014they worked late and expected dinner. The mom's refusal to help or buy ingredients when they don't have the skills to use what's already there seems neglectful.\n\nHowever, the author did get angry and left the conversation, which might be seen as a reaction. But given the circumstances, the root issue is the mom's lack of support. So the author isn't in the wrong; the problem lies with the mom's approach. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
