My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home from school late expecting dinner, but their mom said they had to cook for themselves. The user is frustrated because they don't know how to use the stove or cook anything beyond microwave meals. Their mom mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, but the user points out that the mom actually taught the sister. The user asked to be driven to the store to buy something they could make, but the mom refused. The user got angry and went to their room, now hungry and asking for grilled cheese instructions.\n\nFirst, the user's responsibilities. At 17, while it's reasonable to start learning life skills like cooking, it's also common for parents to teach their kids. If the mom never taught them and hasn't allowed them to learn on their own, that's a problem. The user's argument is that they were never given the opportunity to learn. The mom's response to send them to cook without guidance or prior teaching seems harsh. \n\nThe sister being 14 and able to cook might be because the mom did teach her, which the user correctly points out. The user's request to go to the store is logical\u2014they want to buy something they can make, but the mom refuses, even though the user can't drive. That leaves the user in a bind, unable to cook and without access to simple ingredients. \n\nThe user's anger is a reaction to being left hungry without the means to feed themselves. The mom didn't provide dinner, didn't help or teach, and refused to help them get the resources to cook. The user isn't asking for a full meal, just something they can manage. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, getting angry because they're hungry and not being supported is understandable. The mom's responsibility is to provide for her child's needs, including food. If the user hasn't been taught cooking, it's the parent's fault. The user is in a position where they can't cook, so expecting them to just figure it out without any support is unreasonable. The mom's refusal to help them access simple ingredients (like driving them to the store) adds to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is 17, and there's an expectation to learn some independence. However, the parent is the one who didn't teach them. The user isn't being unreasonable in their request; they just need the support they weren't given. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful, which led to the conflict. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom didn't teach them, didn't help when asked, and the user's frustration is justified given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
