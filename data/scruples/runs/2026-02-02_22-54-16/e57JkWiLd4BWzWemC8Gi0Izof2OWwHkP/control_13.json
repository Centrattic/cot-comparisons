My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the 17-year-old is upset because their mom didn't cook dinner, and they can't cook themselves. The mom expects them to make something, but they don't know how. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager, but they can't cook anything beyond a few basic things. The mom didn't teach them, and she's not allowing them to drive to get food. The author worked on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner, but the mom said they should just figure it out. The mom mentions the 14-year-old sister can cook and that the author is old enough to learn. \n\nHmm, so the mom might be trying to teach independence, but if the author wasn't taught how to cook, then expecting them to cook without prior instruction seems unfair. Also, the author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom says they have ingredients to cook with, but if the author doesn't know how to use them, that's a problem. The fact that the sister was taught but the author wasn't adds to the issue. \n\nBut wait, 17 is an age where some level of self-sufficiency is expected. However, the mom's responsibility might include teaching basic life skills. If the author was never taught, it's not their fault. Getting angry might be a reaction to being left without food and not having the skills. The mom's response might be dismissive, leading to the author's frustration. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because the mom didn't provide necessary skills. However, expecting a 17-year-old to be independent without any training could be on the mom. But the author's reaction could have been more constructive. Instead of getting mad and going to their room, maybe asking for help in a calmer way. \n\nBut the main issue is the lack of teaching. The mom might be right in terms of pushing independence, but if she didn't teach, she's part of the problem. The author is in a tough spot. So considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the mom didn't teach them and is now expecting them to handle something they aren't equipped for.\n"
