My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 17 years old and can't cook. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. After coming home from a long day at school working on prom decorations, they expected dinner but their mom said they have to figure it out themselves. The author tried to explain they can't cook, mentioned they can't use the stove, and even asked to be driven to the store to buy something easier, but the mom refused. The argument continued, the author got fed up and went to their room, and now they're hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a minor, only 17, and hasn't been taught cooking skills. They have specific examples of things they can make, but those are very basic. They were at school until 7, which is late, and expected dinner. The mom's response is that they should \"get creative\" and that there's plenty to cook with. Also, the mom mentions that the author's 14-year-old sister cooks her own dinner, implying that the author should be able to do the same. However, the sister was taught, while the author wasn't. The mom also doesn't drive the author to the store, even though they can't drive and need the ingredients for something they can actually make.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? At 17, it's expected that some life skills are learned, like cooking. But the author is clearly stating that they weren't taught and are struggling. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but if she never provided the necessary skills or support, that could be a problem. The author is in a vulnerable position, relying on their mom for meals, and now is left without dinner when they can't prepare it themselves. The mom's refusal to buy ingredients even though there are, shows that the author isn't capable yet might be harsh. The author's frustration is understandable given the lack of prior teaching. However, the author's reaction of getting mad and going to their room could be seen as not handling the situation calmly. The mom might have valid reasons for not driving them, like safety or not having time, but not providing an alternative solution is an issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting dinner when they were used to it. The mom's responsibility could be in question for not teaching them cooking skills. The author's request to go to the store seems reasonable to get food they can prepare. The mom's refusal leaves the author without options. The author's anger comes from being unprepared and not being supported. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
