My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They got home expecting dinner, but their mom said they should figure it out. The author is frustrated because they don't know how to cook and the mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they were raised without cooking skills, and now they're expected to cook on their own. They tried to communicate their inability to cook, but the mom kept pushing them to figure it out or use what's available. The mom might think that at 17, the kid should be learning these life skills, even if they haven't been taught yet. But the author is in a situation where they can't even use the stove properly, which is a safety issue too.\n\nThe mom's response to the sister, who is 14, might indicate that she did teach her daughter to cook. However, the author is older and might not have received the same attention. The author also can't drive, so they can't go buy pre-made meals. The mom refuses to buy food for them, so the author is stuck. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room.\n\nFrom a responsibility angle, parents typically provide for their children's needs, including meals. If the kid can't cook and the mom hasn't taught them, expecting them to just figure it out might not be fair. Especially if the mom is the reason they didn't learn. The mom's response of \"you're 17, you can figure it out\" could be dismissive of the kid's actual limitations. The author isn't being a brat just for needing help; they're in a position where their mom hasn't equipped them with necessary skills. However, the author could have tried to learn cooking earlier or taken initiative in some way, but given the mom's lack of support, that's not the case.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult in the making, and expecting some level of independence might be reasonable. But the mom's refusal to help when there's a clear lack of skills and resources (like pre-made meals) might be the issue. The author isn't wrong for being upset about not having dinner, especially after a long day. The mom's response might be contributing to the problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, not the author's fault.\n"
