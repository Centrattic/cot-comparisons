My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and got mad at their mom for not providing dinner. The mom said there's stuff to cook with and that the author should figure it out. The author's sister is 14 and was taught how to cook. The author can't drive and the mom won't take them to the store for ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager, but still young. Not knowing how to cook isn't unheard of, especially if the parent hasn't taught them. The mom's response seems to be expecting the teen to handle it themselves, but there's a lack of support. The author is frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping. The sister was taught, so maybe the mom's approach is inconsistent.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable because they were hungry after a long day at school and expected dinner. The mom's refusal to drive them or provide guidance might be contributing to the tension. The key points are the lack of teaching and the mom's expectation that the teen should figure it out without support.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, getting mad when hungry and expecting dinner might seem like a reaction, but given that the mom hasn't taught them how to cook, it's a legitimate frustration. The author isn't being unreasonable; they need guidance they haven't received. The mom's response is dismissive. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
