My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, is upset with their mom for not cooking dinner. The mom expects the kid to cook, but the kid can't because the mom never taught them. The kid worked until 7 PM and came home expecting dinner. The mom says they need to get creative, but the kid can't cook, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: they're 17, haven't been taught how to cook, their sister (14) was taught, and they're expected to make dinner. The mom's perspective: she's not buying food when they already have ingredients, and she's telling the kid to figure it out. The kid can't drive, so even if they wanted to go to the store, they can't. The kid ends up hungry and frustrated.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. At 17, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of independence, but cooking isn't something everyone naturally learns. If the mom never taught them, it's her responsibility. The kid is working on prom decorations, which is a valid reason to be tired. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since she taught the sister. The kid is asking for help, like driving them to the store, but the mom refuses. The kid's frustration is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid is 17, so maybe they should have tried to find another solution, like eating leftovers or simple meals. But the kid explicitly states they can't cook, which the mom knows. The mom's refusal to help might be the bigger issue here. The kid's anger is a response to being left hungry without support. The mom's actions (or inaction) led to the kid being upset. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the mom is. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
