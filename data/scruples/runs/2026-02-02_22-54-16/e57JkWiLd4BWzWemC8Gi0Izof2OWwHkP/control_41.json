My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom said to make something themselves. The author feels frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom might feel that the child is old enough to start learning to cook, especially since the sister (14) is doing it. But the author is 17 and hasn't been taught. It's possible the mom didn't prioritize teaching them, maybe due to her own priorities or negligence. \n\nThe author's anger comes from being hungry, not knowing how to cook, and feeling unsupported. They asked for help, like driving to the store, but the mom refused. The author's options were limited, so their frustration is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, being 17 is an age where some independence is expected. The mom might think the child should take initiative. However, if the child wasn't taught, expecting them to suddenly figure it out isn't fair. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful. \n\nThe key points are the lack of prior teaching, the immediate need for food, and the mom's refusal to assist. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without options despite not being taught a necessary skill. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's responsibility to provide meals or teach cooking is a factor. Since the author can't cook and the mom didn't teach, the mom's response was probably inadequate. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
