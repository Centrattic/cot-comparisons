My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. \n\nFirst, the author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom hasn't taught them. They worked until 7 PM, came home expecting dinner, but mom said it's up to them. The author can't cook, tried to get help, mom refused, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here: the mom never taught the author how to cook, and the author isn't old enough to drive. The mom is asking a 17-year-old to cook without prior instruction. That seems unreasonable. The author is in a situation where they're expected to prepare dinner but lack the skills. The mom's response is dismissive, even when the author asks for help. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have done something else? Like making their own simple meal? They mentioned knowing ramen, etc. But the mom didn't provide those options either. The author's frustration is valid because they're not equipped to handle the situation. The mom might be trying to teach independence, but without proper guidance, it's not fair. \n\nAlso, the sister is 14 and was taught, which might mean the mom is inconsistent. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and not being supported. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
