My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught by their mom. They came home after working on prom and expected dinner, but the mom said they should figure it out. The author is 17, can't drive, and the mom won't take them to buy food. The sister is 14 and can cook, which the mom points out.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that they were expected to cook when they don't have the skills, which the mom didn't teach them. The mom might see it as the author being too dependent and needing to learn responsibility. \n\nThe author is in a situation where they're expected to handle something they haven't been taught. The mom's response seems to be pushing for independence, but maybe not in a supportive way. The author worked late, so expecting them to cook when they're tired and unskilled might be unreasonable. Also, the sister being taught cooking suggests the mom did teach someone else, but not the author, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior teaching and the immediate need for cooking without support. The author's anger is justified because they were put in a difficult position without the necessary skills. The mom's refusal to help, especially when she taught the sister, shows inconsistency. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate reason to be upset. The mom failed to provide the necessary skills, and the situation was made worse by the mom's refusal to assist. The answer should be B.\n"
