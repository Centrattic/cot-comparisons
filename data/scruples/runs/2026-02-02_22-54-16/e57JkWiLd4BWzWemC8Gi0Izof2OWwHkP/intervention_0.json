My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 17, can't cook beyond a few simple things, and their mom never taught them. They came home from school working on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner to be ready. The mom said \"whatever you can find\" and told them to get creative, even mentioning their 14-year-old sister who makes her own dinner. The author asks for help to the store but the mom refuses. The author then gets fed up and goes to their room, now really hungry, and is asking for grilled cheese instructions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age and the situation. At 17, depending on cultural norms and family dynamics, some people might expect their kids to start learning basic cooking. However, the author says the mom never taught them and never allowed them to teach themselves. The author is clearly frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't offering help, even though the mom is home. The sister is 14, so maybe the mom is comparing them, but the author is older. \n\nThe argument is about the mom not providing dinner when the author can't cook. The key points here are that the author is 17, hasn't been taught cooking, and the mom is dismissing their inability. The author is in a situation where they can't prepare their own meal, so expecting dinner is reasonable. The mom's response of \"whatever you can find\" might be assuming the author can cook, but the author is explaining they can't. The mom's refusal to help by driving them to the store, even though they can't drive, seems like not providing support. \n\nNow, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I need to see if that's a valid interpretation. The author is not making unreasonable demands; they just can't cook and are asking for assistance. The mom's response is dismissive and not helpful. The author is hungry and frustrated. So, the author's anger is understandable. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that at 17, the author should have learned basic cooking skills by now. But the author is stating that the mom never taught them and didn't allow them to teach themselves. So the responsibility might lie with the mom for not providing education. The author is seeking help, not just complaining. \n\nThe author is also in a situation where they can't drive or buy groceries themselves. The mom is home, so driving them to the store is a reasonable request. The mom's refusal to buy food when they already have \"lots\" might be a financial consideration, but if they have ingredients for grilled cheese, maybe the mom could have helped them make it. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. The mom is not supporting them in learning necessary life skills and isn't providing a solution when the author is clearly unable to cook. The author's frustration is justified.\n"
