My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond a few simple things. They were working on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner, but their mom didn't have anything prepared. When they asked, the mom said they should just make something, but the person can't cook. The mom even mentions that their 14-year-old sister can make her own dinner, implying she's been taught. The person asked to be driven to the store to buy something they could cook, but the mom refused. The person got angry and went to their room.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. First, the parent's responsibility: At 17, parents might still be responsible for providing meals, especially if the child hasn't been taught to cook. The mom didn't teach the child, so expecting them to cook might be unfair. However, the mom did teach the sister, so maybe there's an inconsistency here. The parent's response of not driving them to the store despite having enough ingredients is a problem if the child really can't cook. The child's frustration seems valid because they were working and hungry. The parent might be at fault for not providing dinner or teaching the child. The child getting upset is understandable. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
