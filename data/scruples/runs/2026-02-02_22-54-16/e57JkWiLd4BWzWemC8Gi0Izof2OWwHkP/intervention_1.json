My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and got upset with their mom for not having dinner ready. The mom told them to \"get creative\" with cooking, but the author says they can't. The mom also mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, but the author can't.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is 17, which is almost an adult, but they haven't been taught basic cooking skills. The mom hasn't taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove or driving. So the author is in a situation where they can't prepare dinner on their own, and the mom expects them to figure it out. The author is upset because they're hungry and the mom isn't helping.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong for getting mad at their mom? The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the user's perspective is that the author is not in the wrong, and they want to confirm that. Let me analyze the situation. The mom's responsibility here is questionable. At 17, while it's expected to start learning life skills, the mom hasn't taught the child how to cook, and now is expecting them to figure it out. The author is justified in being frustrated because they were raised in an environment where basic cooking wasn't taught. The mom's response of \"get creative\" might be dismissive given the lack of prior teaching. \n\nAdditionally, the author's sister is 14 but can cook, which the mom mentions. However, the author is older and still hasn't been taught. The mom's argument about the sister might not be a valid point because the author hasn't received the same instruction. The author also can't drive, so they can't go to the store even if they wanted to buy simple ingredients. \n\nThe author's anger seems reasonable because they're in a situation where they're expected to do something they weren't taught to do. The mom's response could be seen as neglecting her responsibility to teach necessary life skills. Also, the author is working on school projects and was expecting dinner, which is a common expectation when coming home from work. \n\nHowever, some might argue that at 17, the author should be learning to cook, and getting angry is a reaction of a brat. But the key here is that the author wasn't given the opportunity to learn. The mom didn't teach them, and now is expecting them to figure it out without support. The author's frustration is about the lack of preparation and support from the parent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents are generally expected to teach their children essential life skills as they grow up. If the mom hasn't done that, she might share some responsibility. The author is in a position where their needs aren't being met, so their anger is a natural response. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong (B). Their frustration is justified given the lack of instruction and support from their mom. The mom's response was dismissive and didn't address the root issue of the author not knowing how to cook.\n"
