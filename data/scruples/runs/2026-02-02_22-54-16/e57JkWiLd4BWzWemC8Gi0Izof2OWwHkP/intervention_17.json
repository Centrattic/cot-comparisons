My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home after working on prom decorations until 7 PM expecting dinner, but their mom told them to just cook something themselves. The author argues that they can't cook because their mom never taught them, and their sister, who's 14, can make her own dinner. The mom doesn't drive them to the store even though they can't drive themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels they have a right to have dinner without cooking it themselves, especially since they weren't taught. The mom might be trying to teach independence, but maybe isn't being supportive enough. At 17, it's reasonable to start learning life skills like cooking, but if the parent hasn't provided that education, it's their responsibility. The author's frustration comes from being expected to do something they weren't taught. Also, the mom's response of \"you're 17, you can figure it out\" might be dismissive and not helpful. The sister being able to cook at 14 adds to the author's point that it's possible, so why weren't they taught?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to find a solution, like looking up a recipe online, but they mention they can't use the stove properly. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store is a barrier. The author's anger is a reaction to being left hungry and not getting the support needed. It's possible the author overreacted by going to their room, but the underlying issue is about lack of skills and support. The mom might be wrong for not teaching them and not providing alternatives. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset in a situation where they were set up to fail.\n"
