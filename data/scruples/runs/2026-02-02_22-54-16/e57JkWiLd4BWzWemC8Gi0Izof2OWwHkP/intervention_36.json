My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they can't cook. They list the few things they can make, like ramen and chicken nuggets. Their mom never taught them, and she doesn't trust them to teach themselves. The author is 17, which is an age where some level of independence is expected, but cooking isn't something everyone learns that early.\n\nThe situation is that the author comes home late from school, expecting dinner. The mom says there's nothing ready and tells them to cook something. The author tries to explain they can't, and the mom points to their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The author then asks for a ride to the store, but the mom refuses. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and responsibility. The mom might feel she's given them the means to cook, but the author hasn't been taught, which is the mom's responsibility. At 17, the author is expected to learn life skills, but the mom hasn't provided that education. Reacting with anger might be a response to frustration, not necessarily wrong. The mom's refusal to help despite the author's inability seems harsh. The sister being 14 and able to cook suggests the mom taught her, so the author's request for help is reasonable.\n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner when they can't cook, which is understandable. The mom's response doesn't address the problem, so the author isn't in the wrong for getting upset. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
