My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and can't cook anything beyond a few simple things. They mention their mom never taught them or trusted them to learn. They worked late on prom decorations and expected dinner, but mom didn't have any ready. The mom told them to cook themselves, but the author isn't able to. The mom even mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying she taught the sister but not the author. The author then asks for help, like driving to the store, but mom refuses. The author feels frustrated and goes to their room.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the lack of cooking skills due to mom's refusal to teach, the expectation of dinner after working late, and the mom's response not being helpful. The author's anger seems to stem from being left without options. The mom might be in a position where she expects self-sufficiency, but if she never taught them, is that her fault? Also, comparing to the sister who was taught\u2014maybe the author feels neglected. The situation is about unmet expectations and possible parental responsibility. The author isn't wrong for being upset if they weren't given the tools to handle the situation. So probably, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
