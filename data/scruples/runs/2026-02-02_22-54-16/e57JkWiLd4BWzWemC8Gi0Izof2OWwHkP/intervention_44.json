My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, got mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. They can't cook and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner but instead were told to figure it out. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, but the author hasn't been taught. The author asked for help going to the store, but the mom refused.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break down the points. The author is 17, which is a teenager but still young. They mention they can't cook anything beyond basics. Their mom never taught them, nor did she trust them to learn on their own. The mom's response is to tell them to figure it out, even though the author is clearly struggling. The author was working on prom decorations late and expected dinner, which is a reasonable expectation. The mom's refusal to help, especially when there's a younger sister who can cook, might indicate inconsistency in the mom's approach. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the lack of support. They're asking if they're in the wrong, but from the description, it seems like the mom is not providing necessary support. The author's anger stems from being left without options when they can't cook. The mom's response could be seen as neglecting her responsibility to ensure her child's basic needs are met, especially when the child hasn't been taught essential skills. \n\nHowever, some might argue that at 17, the author should be learning these skills. But since the mom didn't teach them, it's not the author's fault. The author is reacting to a situation where they were not given the tools to be self-sufficient. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old can suddenly cook without prior instruction is unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the mom is the one who failed to provide necessary support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
