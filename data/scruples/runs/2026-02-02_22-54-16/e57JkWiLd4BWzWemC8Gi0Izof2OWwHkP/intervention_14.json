My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who gets angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook and the mom didn't teach them. The mom says there's plenty to cook with and that the sister, who's 14, can cook. The kid wants the mom to drive them to buy something they can cook, but the mom refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid is 17, which is an age where they might be expected to start learning life skills like cooking. However, the mom never taught them, and the kid isn't a driver. The sister is younger but already cooking, which might be a point against the mom not helping. The kid worked late on prom and expected dinner, which is reasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help, and the kid is frustrated because they're actually unable to cook.\n\nThe kid's anger might be justified because they were relying on the mom to provide dinner, especially after a long day. The mom's refusal to help, despite the kid's inability to cook, could be seen as neglect. On the other hand, the mom might think the kid should be learning independence. But since the mom never taught them, expecting them to suddenly figure it out seems unfair. The kid is in a tough spot and reacting emotionally makes sense. The answer might lean towards B, the kid isn't in the wrong.\n"
