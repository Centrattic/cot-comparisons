My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook much besides simple stuff, and after getting home from school, their mom didn't have dinner ready. The mom told them to just find something or cook it themselves, but the author can't. They asked to be driven to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's side: they're 17, haven't been taught to cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They were expecting dinner after working late. The mom's side: she expects a 17-year-old to be able to cook or use what's available, and she's not driving them. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. To answer A or B, I need to consider if the author overreacted. The author isn't a child, but 17 is still a minor. However, the mom didn't teach them cooking skills, so maybe it's her responsibility. On the other hand, expecting a 17-year-old to be somewhat independent is reasonable. But the author didn't have the skills because the mom didn't teach them. The mom's response seems dismissive. \n\nAlso, the author's request to be driven to buy something they can cook was denied, which added to the frustration. The fact that the sister, who is 14, was taught to cook by the mom shows inconsistency. The author's anger might be justified because they weren't given the tools to be independent. \n\nSo the answer is B (not in the wrong). The mom didn't teach them how to cook, so expecting them to cook without prior instruction is unfair. The author's frustration is valid.\n"
