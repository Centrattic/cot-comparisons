My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom told them to figure it out. The author is frustrated because they can't cook and their mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're a teenager who hasn't been taught cooking or how to use the stove. They can only make a few simple things. The mom might see them as old enough to learn, but the author feels unprepared. The mom did teach their 14-year-old sister, which adds to the frustration. The author asked for help (to go to the store), but the mom refused, leading to the argument.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're 17, which is an age where some independence is expected, but cooking isn't a given skill. The mom's response could be seen as dismissive. However, maybe the author could have tried to learn earlier. But the mom never taught them, so it's not the author's fault they didn't learn. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but the approach was harsh. The author's anger is understandable given the situation. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the mom didn't provide necessary support, and the author's frustration is valid."
