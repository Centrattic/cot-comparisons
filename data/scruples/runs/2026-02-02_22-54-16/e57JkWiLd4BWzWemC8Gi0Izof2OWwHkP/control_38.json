My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom said they should cook themselves, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, as the sister is 14 and can cook. But the author hasn't been taught, so they can't cook. The mom might not realize how difficult it is for the author. Also, the author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help or teaching, which could be seen as neglecting to provide necessary skills.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is 17, so maybe the mom expects them to be more self-sufficient. But the author clearly states they lack the skills and the mom hasn't provided any support. The argument escalated, but the root cause is the mom not teaching them. The author's frustration is understandable given the lack of support. The mom's response to the sister being able to cook but not teaching the older child might be a factor. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were not given the tools to cook. The mom is responsible for teaching them, and her refusal to help or drive them to get food when they can't drive is part of the problem. The author's anger comes from being left without resources. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
