My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they got home expecting dinner, their mom told them to figure it out. The author then gets upset and argues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager, and maybe they're used to having meals provided. They mention not being taught how to cook and not knowing how to use the stove. Their mom says that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying that the author should be able to as well. The mom also refuses to take them to buy food, even though they can't drive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that it's unfair not to be taught and that their mom is not supporting them. They worked on prom decorations until 7 PM, so they might be tired and expecting dinner. The mom's response might seem dismissive, especially since she doesn't offer help or alternatives. The author's frustration makes sense if they feel helpless and unsupported.\n\nOn the mom's side, she might believe that the author, at 17, should be learning independence. She mentions the sister can cook, so maybe she's trying to encourage self-sufficiency. However, she hasn't actually taught the author, so expecting them to figure it out when they haven't been taught could be unrealistic. Also, not being able to drive complicates the situation further.\n\nThe key points are: the mom didn't teach the author to cook, the author can't drive, and the mom is now expecting them to handle it. The author's anger might be justified because they were not given the tools to be self-sufficient. The mom's response doesn't account for the fact that the author hasn't been taught, leading to a situation where they can't meet expectations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mom's approach might be flawed because she didn't teach the author, yet expects them to handle cooking. The author's frustration is valid given the lack of support. However, the author's reaction of getting angry and isolating themselves might be considered an overreaction. But considering the circumstances, the mom's responsibility to provide for their child's basic needs (food) might still lie with her, especially if the child isn't capable yet.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their mom's expectation without prior teaching is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
