My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, can't cook beyond a few basic things. They came home after working on prom until 7 PM expecting dinner. Their mom tells them to make their own food, citing that they're old enough. The author argues they can't cook and that their sister (14) was taught, but mom refuses to drive them to buy food. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nThe key points here are the author's inability to cook, the expectation to make dinner despite that, and the lack of support from the mom. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but if the mom never taught them, it's a problem. The mom is putting responsibility on the kid without providing the necessary skills or resources. The author's frustration is valid because they're being asked to do something they weren't taught, and the mom isn't helping. The sister being taught at 14 shows that the mom is capable of teaching, but the author wasn't. The author's request to be driven to buy food is denied, leaving them stuck. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry because the mom is failing to support them in a task they weren't taught. The mom's response is dismissive and doesn't address the root issue. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without options. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
