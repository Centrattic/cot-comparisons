Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The context is that the neighbors don't get along with them, partly because of the kids bullying their own. The user has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave items behind.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yards, so they're strict about that. The neighbor kids, however, keep meandering into their yard during games. The user has found several items left there. Initially, they left the items, but after they stayed there forever, they started throwing them back. Now, they just throw them away immediately. \n\nThe key here is property ownership. The user's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items on your property, you generally have the right to dispose of them, especially if they are considered abandoned. The user did warn the neighbors multiple times not to leave things there, which might be important. However, the neighbor Dad was upset when the baseball glove was thrown away, leading to almost a physical altercation. \n\nLegally, in many places, if someone leaves property on your land and doesn't claim it, you can get rid of it. But etiquette-wise, maybe they could have tried to return the items somehow, even if they didn't want the kids on their property. The user might be justified in their actions because they've communicated their boundaries, and the neighbors didn't respect them. However, the tension with the neighbors complicating things. \n\nThe user's actions are a response to the neighbors' kids not following the set boundaries. They might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their own property. But there's a possible lack of a final warning or attempt to contact the neighbors directly before discarding. Still, if the items are left there repeatedly and not claimed, the user's decision to throw them away could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The neighbor's reaction is intense, but the user's actions are about their own property. The main issue here is the conflict with the neighbors, but the act of disposing of items is about the user's right to control their property.\n"
