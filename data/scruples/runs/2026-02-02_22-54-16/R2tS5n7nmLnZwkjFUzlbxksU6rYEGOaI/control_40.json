Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about throwing away toys that neighbor kids leave in their yard. The user provided the context where the neighbors don't get along with them, there's been bullying, and the author has asked the kids not to hang around or leave things in their yard. The author mentions having found several items left by the neighbor's kids and initially left them there but now throws them away. There was an incident where the neighbor Dad got angry about the glove being thrown out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Property rights usually mean that the owner can control what's on their land. If the toys are left unattended, the owner might have the right to dispose of them, especially if they've communicated that they don't want items there. But sometimes, depending on local laws, there might be a notice requirement or a period where the owner has to hold onto lost items before discarding. The author didn't mention giving a specific notice period, just that they asked multiple times.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is protecting their own property and making it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. They have a history of tension and bullying with the neighbors, which adds context. However, throwing away items that could be considered lost might be seen as harsh. Maybe they could have left the items at the neighbor's house or a local lost and found instead of just discarding them. The problem here is the communication breakdown. The neighbors might not be aware that the items are being thrown away immediately. The author did state they've made it clear, but if the neighbors are not keeping up, perhaps the author should have tried other methods first, like returning the items when possible or discussing it more directly with the parents.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yards or leave things there is important. It shows that the author is trying to be considerate in one aspect, but not the other. The key issue is whether the author has a duty to return lost property. In many places, the law requires a reasonable attempt to return lost items, but the author might not be making those attempts. If they've already tried returning items by placing them back in the neighbor's yard, maybe that's sufficient. However, when the items are in their own yard, the neighbor's kids might not come by to retrieve them, so perhaps the author is not at fault for not keeping them indefinitely.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor getting angry might be justified if they believe the items were left in the yard for a reason and the author is being too quick to dispose. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate or even spiteful, especially if there's an ongoing conflict. The right to control one's property is significant, but the manner in which the author handles the situation might be the issue. If they had given a clear notice, like posting a sign, or if they tried to contact the neighbors before discarding, that might have been more appropriate. Since the author says they've asked multiple times, maybe they are within their rights, but the neighbors might still expect the items to be kept until they can retrieve them.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the reasonableness of the author's actions. If they've made it clear and the neighbors continue to leave items, the author might be within their rights to dispose. But if the neighbors could have reasonably expected to retrieve the items, the author might be in the wrong. Since the author's yard is a private property, and they've communicated their stance, it's likely they are not in the wrong legally. However, ethically, there might be a gray area. The situation is complicated by the existing conflict, so the author's actions could be seen as justified given the circumstances.\n"
