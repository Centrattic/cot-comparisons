Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the situation is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along. There were issues with the kids bullying the author's kids, and a previous incident with a dog. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming through the yard, leaving items behind. The author initially tried returning items but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are property rights and prior communication. The author owned up to their yard being their property and had already communicated their boundaries. The neighbor kids were coming through without permission, leaving items. The author's action of throwing away the items is a response to repeated violations of their space. \n\nBut wait, property law generally says that if someone leaves an item on your property, you can't just throw it away without a reasonable attempt to return it. However, the author did try returning items initially. Now they're just discarding them. The neighbors might argue that the items were left there accidentally, not intentionally. But the author mentions that the kids were meandering through games into their yard, so maybe it's not entirely accidental. \n\nAlso, the author's intent is to enforce their boundaries after being disrespected. They had a prior incident where the dog scared their autistic son, leading to a conflict. The author is protecting their space and their children. The neighbors might see the disposal of items as an aggressive act, but the author sees it as a necessary measure after multiple warnings. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might have a valid reason to enforce their property rules, especially after multiple attempts to communicate. However, legally, throwing away someone else's belongings might still be an issue. But from a moral standpoint, if the neighbors were repeatedly violating the space, the author's actions could be seen as justified. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether we're looking at it legally or morally. The question is about being in the \"wrong\" in the general sense. Since the author tried to return items and the neighbors continued to leave them, throwing them away as a form of self-enforcement might be acceptable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
