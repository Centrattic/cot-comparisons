Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author is throwing them away after they asked the neighbors not to leave things there.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The neighbors don't get along, there were issues with the kids bullying, and a dog incident. The author has made it clear that the kids shouldn't be in their yard or leave items there. The kids still do it, so the author initially left the items, but now throws them away. The neighbor almost got into a fight over a glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone else's items are left there, legally, the owner of the property can dispose of them, especially if they've notified the people not to leave things. The author did warn them multiple times. However, there's a social aspect too. Even if legally okay, it might come off as hostile. The neighbor's reaction was strong, so maybe the author could have tried another method first, like returning the items or contacting the parents. But the author already tried putting them back, and the parents never claimed them. Throwing them away after that might be reasonable. The tension between them adds context. So, the author's actions might be justified in terms of property rights, but the way they handled it could be seen as rude. Still, the key is whether they're in the wrong. Since they've given warnings and the items were left unclaimed, it's likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
