Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after repeated issues. \n\nFirst, the neighbors don't get along with the author, and there's been some past issues like bullying and a dog scaring the author's autistic son. The author has clearly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out or leave things in their yard. The kids still do it, so the author used to leave the items there, but after the items stayed for a long time and weren't claimed, they started throwing them away.\n\nThe key here is property ownership. If the toys are left on the author's property, does that make them abandon their ownership? Legally, if someone leaves property unattended on your land, it might be considered abandoned, but that can vary by jurisdiction. However, the author's main point is that they've communicated their boundaries and the neighbors haven't respected them. The author is removing items that are left in their yard, which they own, to prevent the kids from coming in again. \n\nThere's also the neighbor dad almost coming to blows over the baseball glove. The author might be seen as taking a strict stance, but given the previous issues (bullying and the dog incident), their actions could be a way to enforce boundaries. The question is whether throwing away the items is a reasonable response after multiple warnings. \n\nIf the author had returned the items each time, maybe the neighbors would have continued to leave them. But by throwing them away, the author is trying to stop the cycle. The author's kids don't do the same, so it's a one-sided issue. \n\nI think the author is justified in taking such steps, especially after clear communication and the prior negative interactions. The answer is B.\n"
