Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbors don't get along with the author, there were issues with their kids bullying the author's children and a dog incident. The author made it clear that the neighbors' kids shouldn't hang out in their yard or leave items there. Despite this, the kids keep entering and leaving toys. The author used to leave the items but noticed they weren't being claimed, so now they throw them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor's dad when a glove was thrown away. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author set boundaries, the neighbors didn't respect them, the kids left items in the yard, and the author is disposing of them. The question is about whether this action is right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of property rights, the author owns their yard, and if someone leaves items there without permission, they might have a right to dispose of them. But there's a social aspect too. Even though the author doesn't like the neighbors, throwing away items could be seen as hostile or escalate tensions. The neighbor's dad was upset enough to almost come to blows, which is a strong reaction. \n\nThe author did give multiple warnings. If the items are left on their property and not claimed, maybe it's reasonable to assume the owners don't want them anymore. However, returning the items to the neighbor's yard might have been a better approach to avoid confrontation. Throwing them away might be seen as impolite, even if legally they can do that. \n\nAlso, the fact that their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yard or leave items there shows they're respecting the other side's property, which is a point in their favor. But the neighbors' kids aren't following that, so the author is inconsistent in handling the situation. \n\nI think legally the author isn't in the wrong because it's their property. But socially, it's a gray area. Since the neighbors don't get along, the author's actions might be justified, but there's a better way to handle it. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure I didn't miss any nuances. The main issue is that the author communicated their boundaries and the neighbors didn't adhere, so the author is within their rights to remove items.\n"
