Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves ongoing tension between the families, with the neighbor kids leaving items in the yard despite the author's requests.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. They even mention that their own kids don't enter the neighbors' yards. The neighbors' children keep leaving items in the yard, which the author previously tried to return but now just throws away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor Dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nLegally, property rights are a factor. If the items are left on the author's property, they might have the right to dispose of them, especially if there's no claim. But socially, the issue is about respecting boundaries. The author set a boundary by asking the neighbors to keep their kids out of the yard. The kids are ignoring this, which leads the author to take action. However, throwing away items might be seen as harsh. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that this action is causing more conflict. The author could have tried other methods, like contacting the parents to enforce the boundary without escalating tensions. But since the parents were already hostile, maybe the author felt this was the only way. Still, discarding items might be seen as going beyond just setting a boundary. There's a balance between property rights and community relations. The key points are whether the author warned them, if the items were left intentionally, and if there's a reasonable expectation of retrieval. If the kids left the items there repeatedly and the parents didn't act, the author's actions might be justified. But throwing things away without trying to return them could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the situation. Since they did communicate their wishes and the neighbors kept violating them, the author might not be in the wrong. But the method of disposal could be questioned. However, given the context of prior communication and the neighbors' repeated disregard, it's possible the author is justified.\n"
