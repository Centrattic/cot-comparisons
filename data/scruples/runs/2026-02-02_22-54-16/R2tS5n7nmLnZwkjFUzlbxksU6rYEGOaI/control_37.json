Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The neighbors don't get along, there's been past issues with the kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. The author has clearly told the neighbors not to have their kids in their yard. Despite that, the neighbor kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author initially left the items but then started throwing them back, and now just throwing them away. There was an altercation when the neighbor dad found out about the glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the key points here: ownership of the property, the terms of possession. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's in it. But when they take someone else's items, even if left behind, there might be legal implications. However, in many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on another person's land, the landowner can remove it, especially if they've given notice. But the neighbor kids are minors, so their parents might be responsible. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The parents might be responsible for supervising their kids, but by allowing their kids to leave items, maybe they are at fault. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as reasonable because they've tried to avoid confrontation by returning items before. Now, throwing them away might be a way to prevent future issues. However, the neighbor's reaction led to a conflict, which complicates things. Legally, the author might have the right to remove items from their property, especially if they've given notice. But socially, it's a different matter. The parents might feel it's their responsibility to retrieve items, so the author's action could be seen as dismissive or confrontational. \n\nBut given the history of conflicts and the author's attempts to set boundaries, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. They are protecting their property and enforcing their wishes. The parents might need to be more proactive in retrieving items, but the author's actions are within their rights. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
