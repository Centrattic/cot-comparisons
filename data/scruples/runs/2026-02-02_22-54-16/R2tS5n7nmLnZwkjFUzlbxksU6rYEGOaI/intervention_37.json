Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves neighbors whose kids leave toys in their yard, and the author throws them away after multiple requests not to have the kids there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, so they started returning them, then eventually just throwing them away. There was a confrontation when a dad found out about the glove being thrown away.\n\nNow, considering property rights: the author's yard is their property. If someone else's belongings are left there, the owner has the right to handle those items. However, there might be a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to return lost property, but in this case, the items were left repeatedly and not claimed. Throwing them away after a reasonable attempt to return could be justified.\n\nThe neighbors' kids were allowed to play in the yard without permission, leading to the mess. The author set boundaries and tried to enforce them. The dad's reaction might be more about the loss of a specific item than the author's right to handle the property.\n\nBut maybe the issue is that the author could have given more notice or tried to contact the parents before discarding items. However, the author did mention they had asked multiple times. The conflict arises when the dad confronts, but the author was upfront about their actions.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in many places, if someone leaves property on your land, you can dispose of it after making attempts to return it. Since the items were left numerous times and not claimed, the author's actions might be within their rights. However, the social aspect might depend on community norms. The author is in a tense situation with neighbors, so their actions, while legally sound, might be seen as harsh socially.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are protecting their property and had communicated their boundaries. The neighbors' kids were entering without permission, and the author took reasonable steps to handle the items after repeated issues.\n"
