Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves a history of conflict between the families, with the neighbors' kids frequently using the author's yard and leaving items behind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author clearly owns their yard, and they've communicated to the neighbors that they don't want the kids in their space. If the toys are left on the author's property, legally, the owner has the right to handle them. However, the neighbors might argue that the items belong to their children, so disposing of them could be seen as damaging someone else's property. But the author is doing this after multiple requests to not leave items, which adds context.\n\nNext, the neighbor's reaction is a key point. The author mentions almost coming to blows, indicating a tense situation. While the author has the right to their property, the way they handle it could affect community relations. However, the author isn't keeping or using the items; they're disposing of them, which is different from holding onto them or using them against the neighbors.\n\nAlso, the author made clear boundaries beforehand. If the neighbors kept placing items in the yard despite the warnings, the author's actions might be seen as a reasonable response to enforce their property rights. However, the act of throwing away someone else's items can be seen as extreme, especially if the items have value or sentimental worth. The neighbors have a right to their children's belongings, and the author might be infringing on that by discarding them without a way to retrieve.\n\nBut there's a balance here. The author's right to control their property is significant. If the items are left there repeatedly, it's a nuisance. The author isn't keeping the items; they're removing the nuisance. The neighbors have a responsibility to retrieve items from their own children, but if they neglect that, the owner might have the right to remove the items after a reasonable time. However, how long is \"reasonable\" is subjective. The author initially left them but after that didn't see retrieval, so they escalated to throwing them away.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting their property, especially after setting boundaries. The neighbors might be at fault for not respecting those boundaries and not retrieving their items. However, the act of throwing away belongings can be seen as harsh, but in a situation where the owner has repeatedly asked and the issue persists, it's a valid response. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
