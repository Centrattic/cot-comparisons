Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation involves a history of conflict with the neighbors, including the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son and kids bullying their children. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard and has previously tried returning items but now just throws them away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Legally, if something is left on someone's property, the owner can dispose of it, especially if it's been left there repeatedly and the owner has communicated their wishes. The author has warned the neighbors multiple times, so there's a clear boundary set.\n\nNext, the neighbor's actions: their kids are constantly entering the yard and leaving items. The author's kids aren't doing the same, which shows consistency in the author's approach. The issue here is about respect for property and the neighbors' response. The neighbor Dad was upset enough to almost come to blows, which might indicate a lack of respect for the author's boundaries.\n\nBut there's also a social aspect. Even if legally the author is within their rights, the social norms might suggest returning lost items. However, given the hostile history, the author's actions could be seen as self-defense in maintaining their space. The key points are communication (author made their stance clear), repeated issues (items left consistently despite warnings), and the neighbors' own disregard for the author's property (kids entering without permission).\n\nThere's a balance between being considerate and protecting one's space. The author's escalation from returning items to throwing them away might be justified after repeated failures to retrieve them. The neighbor's aggression in the confrontation also plays a role here. If the author had simply kept the items without notice, that could be different, but throwing them away after a direct request and prior returns seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the kids: throwing away toys they left might be harsh, but given the author's attempts to avoid conflict and the neighbors' lack of cooperation, it's a way to prevent ongoing issues. The author is trying to protect their environment from being invaded by the neighbor's children, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author has communicated boundaries, tried returning items, and now is taking action to prevent further intrusion. The neighbors are not respecting those boundaries, leading to the author's response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
