Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing away the neighbor kids' toys. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user has neighbors on both sides who don't get along with them. The main issues mentioned are that the neighbor's kids were bullying theirs, and there was an incident where a neighbor's dog scared the autistic son, leading to a confrontation about the dog being on a leash.\n\nThe user has established boundaries, making it clear that the neighbor's kids shouldn't hang out in their yard or leave items there. They mention that their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yards. However, the neighbor kids still enter their yard during games and leave toys. The user used to leave the toys but they stayed there forever without being claimed, so they started throwing them back, and now just throw them away. The key point is that the neighbor Dad almost came to blows when the glove was thrown away. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for doing this after multiple requests.\n\nFirst, property rights: the user's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items on private property, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's a social expectation to either return items or perhaps give them to charity, but the user is choosing to throw them away. They've tried returning them by putting them back into the neighbor's yard, but that didn't work, so they escalated to discarding. \n\nThe neighbor's kids are trespassing by entering the yard. If they leave property on private land, the owner can dispose of it, especially if the items were left without permission. The user has communicated their boundaries clearly, so the neighbors are aware. The fact that the neighbor Dad reacted so strongly suggests some level of frustration or expectation that the user should hold onto the items, but given the history of conflict, maybe the user's actions are justified as protecting their space. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. Throwing away items that belong to others might be seen as harsh, even if they were left on the property. Some might argue that the user could have given the items to the neighbors through a third party or kept them in a box to be returned later. But the user has already tried returning them to the neighbor's yard, which the neighbors might not be checking. If the items are unclaimed for a long time, the owner might have the right to dispose of them. \n\nAlso, the context of the ongoing conflict and the bullying adds to the user's justification. They might feel that the neighbors aren't respecting their property or the safety of their children. The fact that the neighbors don't speak to each other and the user has made it clear that there's no friendly relationship means that the social obligation to be accommodating might be less. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away immediately; you might need to make a reasonable effort to return it. The user tried returning the items by putting them back into the yard, which might be considered a reasonable effort. If the neighbors are ignoring their own yard, then the user might not be obligated to hold onto the items indefinitely. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of neighborly relations. Even if there's conflict, handling items in a way that could be seen as confrontational might escalate issues. However, the user's actions are in response to the neighbor's kids not respecting their property and the prior incident with the dog. \n\nSo, considering property rights and the fact that the user has communicated their boundaries, I think they're within their rights to dispose of the items. The neighbors might be responsible for their own children's behavior, and the user is taking measures to enforce their rules. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
