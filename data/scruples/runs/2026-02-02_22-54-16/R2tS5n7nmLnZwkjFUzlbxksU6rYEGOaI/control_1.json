Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves neighbors whose kids leave toys in their yard, and the author throws them away after multiple requests not to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's a history of the neighbor's kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident. The author has clearly told them not to let their kids hang out in the yard or leave items. Despite this, the kids keep coming in and leaving things. The author tried moving the items back but now just throws them away. There was a confrontation where the neighbor almost came to blows because of the thrown-away glove.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on property rights and reasonable actions. The author's property is their own, so they have the right to control what's on it. However, throwing away someone else's belongings might be legally questionable unless they have a right to do so. If they have given notice and the items are still left, maybe it's justified. But legally, throwing away someone else's property without notice could be seen as theft or conversion. However, in practice, people might understand the context given the prior issues. The author tried moving the items back, which is a middle ground, but switching to throwing them away could be seen as taking it too far. The neighbor's reaction suggests that this action escalated tensions. So, while the author's intent is to prevent items from being left, the method might be problematic. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they are protecting their property, but there's a gray area. Alternatively, A if throwing away items without returning them is considered wrong. But given the context, the answer might be B since the author has set boundaries and the other party is not respecting them.\n"
