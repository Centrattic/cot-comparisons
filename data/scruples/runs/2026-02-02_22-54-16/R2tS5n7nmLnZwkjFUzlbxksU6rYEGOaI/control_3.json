Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves neighbor kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after multiple requests to not do so.\n\nFirst, property rights are a key factor here. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. If the toys are left on the author's property, legally, the author might have the right to dispose of them, especially if the items were not claimed. However, the neighbors might argue that the items belong to their kids and that the author shouldn't get rid of them without returning them.\n\nThe author tried to return the items initially by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard. Then, after the items were left again, they started throwing them away. The neighbor dad almost had a confrontation because the author disposed of the glove. This suggests that the neighbors expected the items to be returned, not discarded.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as reasonable if they've made their boundaries clear and the neighbors aren't respecting them. However, throwing away property that someone might still want could be considered harsh. The author might be within their rights to remove items from their property, but throwing them away instead of returning them could be seen as overstepping, especially if the items are valuable or sentimental.\n\nAlso, considering the prior issues (bullying, dog incident), the author might feel justified in protecting their space. But the neighbors might feel the author is retaliating. The question is whether the author overreacted by discarding the items instead of finding another solution, like contacting the parents or leaving them in a visible place for retrieval.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, property owners can remove items left on their property, but there might be a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to return lost property. The author returned some items by placing them back, but when that didn't work, discarding might be legally acceptable but socially frowned upon.\n\nSo the answer might depend on whether the author made a reasonable attempt to return the items. Since they initially tried to return them, but after repeated instances decided to throw them away, it's a gray area. However, the neighbors' reaction and the potential for escalation suggest that the author's actions, while perhaps legally okay, might not be the most considerate approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in the context of neighborly relations, even if legally justified.\n"
