Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation involves some history of conflict between the neighbors, including the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son and subsequent tension. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbor's kids in their yard, but the kids still come through, leaving items behind.\n\nSo, the key points here are about property rights and the author's actions. The author initially tried to return the items, then started throwing them away after repeated issues. The neighbor got angry when the glove was thrown away. \n\nLegally, property owners have the right to remove items left on their property without permission. However, there might be some nuances. If the items were left there accidentally, the rightful owner might have a claim to retrieve them. But since the author had already been returning items before, then changed to throwing them away, it depends on their intent. \n\nEthically, it's about respect and communication. The author made their stance clear about not wanting the kids on their property. If the items were left repeatedly despite warnings, the author might feel justified in disposing of them to prevent further intrusion. However, the neighbor might see this as harsh, especially if they didn't know the author was keeping the items. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as self-protective, given the existing tension and the initial incident with the dog. But throwing away items without trying to return them might be seen as cutting off communication entirely. However, the author did try returning them before, so the shift in behavior could be justified due to frustration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made their boundaries clear and tried returning items. After repeated issues, disposing of the items is a reasonable step to enforce their property rights and personal boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
