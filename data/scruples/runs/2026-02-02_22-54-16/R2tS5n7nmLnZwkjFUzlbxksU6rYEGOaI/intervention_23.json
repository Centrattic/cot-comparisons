Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person has ongoing issues with their neighbors, including bullying of their kids and a dog incident involving their autistic son. They've set boundaries, making it clear that the neighbor's kids shouldn't hang out or leave things in their yard. The neighbors' kids, however, keep walking through the yard during games and leaving items. The author used to return the items but now throws them away, which led to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has communicated their boundaries, the neighbors aren't respecting them, and the author is dealing with the items left behind. The main question is whether throwing away the items is wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, property owners can control what happens on their land. If the items are left unattended, the owner might have the right to dispose of them, especially after notifying the other party. However, there's a social aspect too. Even if legally okay, the action might be seen as harsh if the other party feels disrespected. The author did try returning items before, but now just throws them away. The neighbor's reaction suggests they were upset, so maybe the author could have communicated more or found another way to handle it. But since the neighbors aren't cooperative, the author is protecting their property.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They've set boundaries and are enforcing them after repeated issues. However, there's a nuance. Even though they're not legally or morally wrong, their approach might be seen as confrontational. But since the neighbors aren't respecting their wishes, the author is justified in protecting their property.\n"
