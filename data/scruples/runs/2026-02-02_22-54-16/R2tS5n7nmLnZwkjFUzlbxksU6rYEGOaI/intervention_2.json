Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. The neighbors are not on good terms with the author, there's a history of issues with the kids bullying their own children, and the author has already made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard.\n\nThe author mentions that they used to leave the items but eventually started throwing them away after the kids didn't claim them. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor dad. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Property owners generally have the right to control what happens on their property. If the toys are left on their property, the author isn't necessarily obligated to keep them. However, there's a social etiquette aspect. Even if they have the right, the way they handle it might affect their relationship with the neighbors.\n\nThe author did warn the neighbors multiple times not to leave things in their yard. If the neighbors continued to do so despite the warnings, the author might feel justified in taking action. But throwing away items that the kids might need could be seen as harsh. The neighbor dad's reaction suggests that the items were important, so maybe the author could have tried another approach first, like contacting the parents to return the items instead of just throwing them away.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid concern about safety and their own property. They've been clear about boundaries. The fact that the neighbors' kids are using the yard as a passageway without permission adds to the tension. The author's actions might be a way to enforce those boundaries, even if it leads to conflict.\n\nI need to balance the legal right to control property with the potential social consequences. The author isn't the one using the yard without permission; the neighbors' kids are. The author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to protect their property and enforce previous requests. However, the method of disposal might be seen as extreme, especially if there was no prior communication with the parents before discarding the items.\n\nIn summary, while the author has the right to their property, the approach of immediately throwing away the items without perhaps contacting the parents first might be seen as inconsiderate. But given the context of prior issues and repeated violations, the author might still not be in the wrong. The answer could lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance where the method could be improved.\n"
