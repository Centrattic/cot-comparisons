Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along, there were issues with their kids bullying the writer's kids, and there's some tension because of a dog incident. The writer has explicitly told the neighbors that they don't want their kids using the yard or leaving items there. The writer's own kids don't enter the neighbors' yard. The neighbors' kids, however, often walk through the yard during games and leave items like a baseball glove, multiple balls, etc.\n\nThe writer initially left the items, but when that didn't work, they started throwing them back into the neighbor's yard. Now, they just throw them away. The conflict escalated when the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because the writer threw away a glove, leading to the confrontation.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the writer in the wrong for discarding these items after multiple requests for their kids to not use the yard?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, property owners generally have control over their own property. If someone leaves items on your property, you aren't obligated to keep them. However, there might be some nuances. For example, if the items are considered abandoned, the owner might have no claim, but if they can be identified and contacted, maybe there's a different angle. But the writer has already tried to return items by throwing them back, which suggests the neighbors aren't claiming them. Now they're discarding them, which is a common practice if items are left unclaimed.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The writer has made their boundaries clear. The neighbors' kids are not respecting those boundaries by using the yard and leaving items. The writer's response is a form of enforcing their own space. However, the neighbors might feel entitled to retrieve their children's belongings, even if they're in a public space. The writer might argue that repeated violations justify stricter measures.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of neighborly relations. Even if the writer feels wronged, the method of dealing with the issue might be seen as harsh. The confrontation with the neighbor Dad suggests that this action has caused significant tension. While the writer isn't legally at fault, socially, they might be seen as overreacting, especially since they've already tried returning the items. Discarding them could be seen as cutting off communication or escalating the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer has the right to control their property. If the neighbors aren't retrieving the items, maybe the writer is justified in removing them. The key here is whether the writer gave sufficient notice and tried to resolve it amicably first. The fact that they tried returning the items initially supports their position. However, the escalation to throwing them away after a prior conflict (the near-fight) could be seen as provocative.\n\nIn summary, legally, the writer isn't in the wrong because property owners can dispose of unclaimed items. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. While they have a right to their property, the way they handle it affects community relations. Since they've made their stance clear and the neighbors aren't respecting it, the writer's actions might be seen as a reasonable response to protect their space, even if it causes friction. However, the aggressive disposal leading to a confrontation could tip the balance towards being seen as the problem. But given the context of prior issues and the attempts to handle it, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
