Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author has a bad relationship with their neighbors. There were past issues like the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son and the kids bullying the author's kids. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through and leave toys in the yard. The author used to put the toys back, but now just throws them away, which led to a conflict with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If the neighbors' kids left items there, the author isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's a social aspect too. Even though it's the author's property, the kids might not realize they're leaving items there, or maybe they do but the author is being intentionally harsh.\n\nThe author did give prior notice not to leave things in the yard. If the neighbors repeatedly ignore that, the author is within their rights to remove the items. Throwing them away might be seen as extreme, but if the items are left without being claimed, it's not illegal. However, the neighbor dad almost came to blows, which suggests the author's actions are seen as aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid reason for being upset due to past bullying and the dog incident. They're trying to protect their kids' space. The neighbor kids are using the yard as a path, which could be seen as trespassing, but the author isn't preventing them from going through; just dealing with the aftermath.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between property rights and neighborly courtesy. Legally, they're probably okay. Socially, maybe they could have handled it differently, like informing the parents first before discarding items. But since they've already tried putting them back without success, maybe throwing them away is justified. The answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here where the method of handling it could be seen as harsh. But given the context of prior issues, it's understandable."
