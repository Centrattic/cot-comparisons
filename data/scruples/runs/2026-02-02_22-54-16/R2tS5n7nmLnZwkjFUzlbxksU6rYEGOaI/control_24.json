Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has neighbors they don't get along with. The kids from both sides have had issues, like bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. Their kids don't go into the neighbors' yards, but the neighbor kids keep coming through, playing, and leaving stuff. The author tried leaving the items but since they weren't claimed, they started throwing them away. There was a conflict when the neighbor dad found out.\n\nSo, the question is whether throwing away the items is wrong. Legally, if the items are on your property, you own them? Wait, no. If someone else's items are on your property, they still belong to the person who owns them. So the author is taking possession of someone else's property. But the neighbor kids were in the yard without permission. The author had given prior warnings not to come in. The kids were trespassing, leaving items. The author tried returning them but since the kids kept coming, they just started throwing them away.\n\nIn some places, you might be able to claim abandoned items after a certain period, but the time frame varies. If the items are left there, maybe they're considered abandoned. However, if the items are still in good condition and someone might come to retrieve them, throwing them away could be seen as destroying someone else's property. The author's justification is that they gave multiple warnings and tried to return items before. Now they're just getting rid of them. The neighbor dad was upset when they threw something away, leading to a near confrontation.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be within their right if the items are considered abandoned, but the neighbors might still feel wronged. The author's intent is to prevent the kids from trespassing, but throwing away items could be seen as punitive. The key factors are the prior warnings, the items being left after being told not to, and the legal standing of abandoned property. It's a bit of a gray area. Depending on local laws, the author might have a case, but from a neighbor relations standpoint, it's causing conflict. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but maybe socially? The question is about being in the wrong generally, not just legally. So answer B, No.\n"
