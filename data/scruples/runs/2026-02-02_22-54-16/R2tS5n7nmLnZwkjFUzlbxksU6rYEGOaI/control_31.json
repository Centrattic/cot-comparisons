Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the other neighbors' kids. The user wrote the story where they've had issues with the neighbors, including some bullying of their kids and a previous conflict with a dog. The neighbors' kids often leave items in their yard, and after multiple warnings, the person started throwing those items away, which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are property rights and communication. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard, but the kids kept coming and leaving items. The author tried returning the items but eventually started discarding them. \n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your yard, you aren't responsible for holding onto it indefinitely. However, there's a cultural expectation to return lost items or notify the owner. The author might have a right to remove items from their property since they've communicated their boundaries. But throwing away items without giving the owner a chance to retrieve them could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe author's actions escalated from returning the items to throwing them away. The confrontation with the neighbor suggests that this is a point of tension. Even though the author had warned the neighbors, the act of discarding might be seen as aggressive, especially if the items weren't taken despite the warnings. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors' kids were repeatedly entering the yard and leaving items, which the author had a right to manage. The author's actions could be justified as protecting their property and enforcing boundaries after multiple attempts. \n\nSo, considering both legal and social aspects, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuance. Throwing away items without notice might be seen as extreme, but given the context of prior issues and warnings, the author's actions could be understandable. The answer would depend on whether the author gave the neighbors a chance to claim the items before discarding them. If they did, then it's more justified. If not, it might be seen as inconsiderate. The story says they used to return items but now just throw them away, which implies they gave up after repeated issues. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong) but with some caveats.\n"
