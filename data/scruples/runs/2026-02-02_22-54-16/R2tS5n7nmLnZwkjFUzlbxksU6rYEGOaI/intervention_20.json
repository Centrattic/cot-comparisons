Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along with them, there's been some past issues with the kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave things. They first tried putting the items back, then started throwing them away.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone else's kids leave items in their yard, technically the owner could do with those items as they please. But there's a social aspect here. The neighbors are already in conflict, and the author has asked the kids not to come into their yard. The fact that the items were left there after being asked multiple times might give the author more justification. \n\nBut then, when the author threw away the baseball glove and the neighbor dad nearly came to blows, that's a problem. The author's actions led to tension. Maybe the neighbor feels the items were their kids' property, so throwing them away was wrong. Legally, if the items were on the author's property, they might have the right to dispose of them, but morally or socially, it's a gray area. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Even though they made their boundaries clear, the direct disposal might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the neighbors aren't respecting the author's property by allowing their kids to come through and leave things. \n\nI think the key points are the prior communication from the author. They explicitly told the neighbors not to have their kids in the yard. The neighbors didn't comply, so the author is trying to enforce their boundaries. But throwing away items is a form of taking action that could be considered confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to return the items or contact the parents first. However, the author tried returning them initially, then escalated to throwing away. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author has the right to remove items from their property. However, considering the existing conflict, the author's actions might be seen as adding to the tension. So maybe the answer depends on legal vs. social perspectives. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong, but socially, it's a messier situation. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context of prior warnings and the items being left despite that, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But there's a case for saying they could have handled it differently. However, the main issue is whether they are in the wrong for the action itself. Given the facts, I think the answer is B, No.\n"
