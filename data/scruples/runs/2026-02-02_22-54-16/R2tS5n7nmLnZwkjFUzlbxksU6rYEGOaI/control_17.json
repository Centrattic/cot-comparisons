Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a history of tension between the neighbors. The author mentions that the neighbor kids have bullied their kids, and there was an incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. Because of this, the author wants to keep their yard clear of the neighbors, and has made it clear that the kids shouldn't be in their yard. However, the kids still walk through the yard during games and leave items behind.\n\nThe author used to leave the items but got tired of them piling up and now throws them away. There was an altercation when the neighbor dad found out. The key points here are ownership of the property and the items left behind. \n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your yard, you might not have the right to dispose of it without trying to return it first. But the author tried returning them by throwing them back into the neighbor's yard. However, if the items are still the neighbor's property, the author might not have the legal right to throw them away. \n\nBut there's also a social aspect. The author has asked the neighbors not to leave things, and the neighbors are ignoring those requests. The author's actions could be seen as a way to enforce boundaries, especially given the prior issues. However, throwing away items can be seen as extreme. \n\nIn some cases, people might return items or put them in a lost and found. The author's escalation from returning to the neighbor's yard to throwing away might be where the problem lies. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that this action was a significant issue for them, possibly because they value the items or feel disrespected. \n\nSo, the author might be in the right in terms of protecting their own property and setting boundaries, but legally and ethically, throwing away someone else's belongings without trying to return them first could be seen as wrong. The fact that they tried returning them to the neighbor's yard initially but then escalated to throwing away might be where the line is crossed. The answer likely depends on the specific laws in their area, but generally, the author might be in the wrong for disposing of property without attempting to return it through proper channels.\n"
