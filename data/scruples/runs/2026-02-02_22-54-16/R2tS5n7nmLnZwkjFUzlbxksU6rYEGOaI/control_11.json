Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The context is that they have a bad relationship with both sets of neighbors. There were issues with the neighbors' kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep leaving items in the yard, so the author started throwing them away, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. If someone leaves items on your property, you own them? Not necessarily. If it's considered abandoned, maybe. But usually, if someone leaves something on your property, you can't just throw it away because it might still be their property. However, the author did mention they asked them not to leave things in the yard. But once items are left there, the owner still has rights. \n\nAlso, the author tried to return items before but they were left there forever. Now they're throwing them away. Did they give the neighbors a chance to retrieve? Maybe not. Legally, you might need to make a reasonable effort to return lost property. Throwing it away immediately might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the neighbors were told not to leave things there. If they repeatedly ignored that, maybe the author is justified in taking action. However, the author's actions could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Maybe contacting the neighbors again to retrieve the items, or leaving them in a visible place with a note. Throwing things away without trying to return could be considered inconsiderate or even theft if the items aren't abandoned.\n\nThe neighbor Dad almost came to blows, which shows the tension is high. The author's actions might be seen as escalating the conflict. Even though the author had a reason to be upset, the method of dealing with the toys could be problematic. There might be a better way to handle it without destroying property. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, they might be overstepping by disposing of others' property. But emotionally, given the prior issues, maybe they felt justified. However, the correct approach would be to make a reasonable effort to return the items rather than discarding them. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they disposed of the items without sufficient attempts to return them.\n"
