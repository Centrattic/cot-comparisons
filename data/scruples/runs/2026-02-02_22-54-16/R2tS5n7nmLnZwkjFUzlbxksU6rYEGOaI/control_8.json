Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is property boundaries and ownership. The author made it clear to their neighbors that they don't want the kids to hang out in their yard or leave items there. The neighbors, however, continue to let their kids walk through the yard, leading to items being left behind. The author initially tried returning the items but eventually started throwing them away after multiple instances.\n\nThe key points are: the author has communicated their boundaries, the neighbors are ignoring those boundaries, and the author is taking a firm stance by discarding the items. Now, the neighbor's dad got angry about the baseball glove being thrown away, leading to a confrontation. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLegally, property owners have the right to control their land. If items are left on someone's property without permission, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. However, there might be a moral or social consideration. The author was clear about their expectations, but the neighbors didn't respect that. The author's action of throwing things away could be seen as a reasonable response given the repeated disregard for their boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that throwing away items could be harsh, especially if the items were accidentally left behind. But in this case, the author mentions that the kids are \"meandering\" through the yard during games, which suggests it's not a one-time accident but a recurring issue. The author also tried returning items before escalating to disposal. The fact that the neighbor's dad almost came to blows shows the tension but doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The author had warned them multiple times, so their actions might be justified as self-preservation of their property.\n\nAnother angle is the initial issues with the neighbors\u2014bullying by their kids and the dog incident. The author had valid reasons for being strict. Considering the context, the author's actions seem like a last resort after other methods failed. So, while it's a conflict, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they've communicated their stance and the neighbors are the ones not respecting the boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
