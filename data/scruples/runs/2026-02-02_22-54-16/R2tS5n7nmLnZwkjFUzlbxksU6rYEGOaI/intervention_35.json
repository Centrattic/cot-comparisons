Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along with the author's family, there's been some bullying issues, and the author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, and if they state that they don't want items left there, they have the right to remove or dispose of them. However, the neighbors might expect that if items are left, they can be retrieved, so throwing them away could be seen as going too far. But the author has made it clear multiple times that they don't want the kids in the yard or leaving things. \n\nThen there's the context of the conflict. The neighbors' kids are using the yard without permission, leading to items being left. The author tried leaving the items but they were ignored. Throwing them back and now throwing them away is escalating the situation. The neighbor Dad almost came to blows, which adds tension.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to remove items from their property, but etiquette-wise, maybe they should have tried returning the items instead of discarding. However, given the ongoing conflict and the author's clear boundaries, it's a gray area. The author is protecting their space after repeated violations. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing their property boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
