Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves neighbors whose kids leave toys in the yard, and the author throws them away after trying to warn them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author doesn't get along with the neighbors, there was past bullying, and the neighbor's dog scared their autistic son. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard or leaving items. The kids still do it, and the author has disposed of the items. There was an incident where the neighbor almost got into a fight because the glove was thrown away.\n\nNow, considering property rights. The author owns their yard, so anything left there is technically on their property. The owner has the right to dispose of items left on their property, especially if they've communicated their wishes. The fact that the neighbors' kids are coming through the yard despite being told not to might be a factor. The author tried to return items before but they were ignored, leading to the disposal.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. The author's kids aren't going into the neighbors' yard, so it's a one-sided issue. The author is enforcing their boundaries, which is understandable. However, throwing away items could be seen as harsh, but given the prior attempts to communicate, maybe it's justified.\n\nLegal perspective: Generally, property owners can remove items left on their property. However, there might be community norms or local laws about handling such items. If the author has a \"no trespassing\" sign or has communicated clearly, they're within their rights. However, if the items are still being left despite warnings, the disposal is their prerogative.\n\nEmotionally, the author's actions could be seen as reasonable because of the prior issues with the neighbors. The neighbor's reaction might be over the top, but the author is just following through on their earlier warnings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they own the property and have communicated their boundaries clearly. The disposal is a reasonable step after failed attempts to resolve the issue differently.\n"
