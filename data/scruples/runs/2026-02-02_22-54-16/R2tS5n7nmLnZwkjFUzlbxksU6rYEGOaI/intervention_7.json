Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves a history of tension between the neighbors, including kids bullying their children and a previous incident with a dog. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author first tried returning the items, but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control who enters and what stays there. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission, which the author has already asked them not to do. The author has made their stance clear, so maybe the kids are being disrespectful by ignoring the request.\n\nHowever, the items left behind might be considered someone else's property. Legally, if someone leaves an item on your property, you can't just throw it away without trying to return it first. The author initially tried returning the items, then stopped. If they throw it away, they might be disposing of someone else's property without giving them a chance to retrieve it. But in the story, the items were left there indefinitely, so maybe the author felt they weren't needed anymore.\n\nAnother angle is the neighbor's perspective. The dad got angry when the glove was thrown away, indicating they might have valued it. But if the author has already communicated their boundaries and the kids keep ignoring them, maybe the author is justified in protecting their space.\n\nAlso, the author's kids aren't going into the neighbors' yard, so it's a one-way issue. The author is enforcing their own rules, which they've made clear. The act of throwing away the items could be seen as a reasonable response to repeated boundary violations.\n\nBut ethically, there's a balance between respecting property rights and being considerate. The author tried returning items at first, which is considerate, but after repeated issues, they might feel justified in stopping. However, throwing things away without attempting to notify or return could be seen as harsh, especially if the items have sentimental or monetary value.\n\nIn some cases, if someone leaves items on your property, you can store them for a period, then donate or discard if not claimed. But the author is just throwing them away immediately. Maybe they should have given a notice first, like a written notice, before discarding. But the situation is tense, and the neighbors aren't speaking, so communication might be difficult.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they've made their boundaries clear and are trying to maintain their property. However, the act of throwing away someone else's property without a final attempt to return it could be seen as overly harsh, but given the context of repeated boundary violations and the lack of communication from the neighbors, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or local laws. But since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), and the author has communicated their stance and is protecting their space, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
