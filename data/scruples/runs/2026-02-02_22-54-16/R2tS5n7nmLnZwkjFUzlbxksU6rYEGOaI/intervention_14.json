Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has had issues with their neighbors, including kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. They made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through, play, and leave stuff. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, then started moving them back, and now throws them away. There was a confrontation when a dad found out a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership. If the items are left on the author's property, does the author have the right to dispose of them? Legally, if something is on your property, you might have the right to discard it since it's considered abandoned. But there's also a social aspect here. The author tried to communicate their boundaries, but the neighbors' kids kept coming in. The author's actions could be seen as enforcing their own property rules. However, throwing away items might be seen as harsh, especially if the neighbors expected their kids to retrieve them eventually.\n\nThe neighbors might feel that the author is overstepping, even if the items were left there without permission. The fact that there was a near-argument suggests tension. The author's justification is that they've warned them multiple times, so maybe they're within their rights. But maybe there's a more considerate way to handle it, like putting a note or contacting the parents first to discuss. Still, the author is trying to protect their space and their kids' safety, which could be a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're enforcing their property and previous warnings. But some might argue that throwing away items without trying to return them directly is inconsiderate. However, the author did initially try returning items before moving to discarding them. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the prior communication and the neighbors' continued disregard.\n"
