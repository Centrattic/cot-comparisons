Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author is throwing them away. The neighbors are not on good terms, there was some bullying, and the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. If something is left on someone's property, the owner can dispose of it, right? But there's also the context of the neighbors' kids being young, maybe they just forget. The author tried to throw the items back into the yard first, then moved to throwing them away. The key here is whether the items were left intentionally or just forgotten. If they were just left there temporarily, throwing them away might be seen as taking it too far, even if the owner has the legal right.\n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The author did mention that they've asked the neighbors multiple times not to let their kids leave things in the yard. But if the kids are just passing through, maybe the parents aren't directly responsible. However, the fact that the neighbor dad got angry suggests that the author's action was offensive. The question is whether the author overstepped, even if they had the right to do so.\n\nAlso, the author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, which adds a layer of hypocrisy if the neighbors perceive it that way, but the author is emphasizing their own boundaries. The initial incident with the dog and the autistic son shows there's prior tension, so the neighbor's reaction might be heightened.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people might expect some level of community cooperation. Throwing away items, even if they're on your property, could be seen as harsh. The author's solution of throwing them away instead of returning them might be considered the wrong move because it directly affects the neighbors without giving them a chance to retrieve the items, despite prior warnings. So, maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if there's a legal vs. social aspect here. Legally, the owner can dispose of items on their property, but socially, it's seen as inconsiderate. Since AITA focuses on social wrongs, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
