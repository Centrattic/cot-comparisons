Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying issues, and the kids keep leaving items in the yard despite being told not to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, property owners have the right to control what's on their land. If someone leaves items on your property, you can dispose of them after giving a reasonable notice. The author did mention they had asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave things in their yard. So legally, they might be in the right.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Even if it's legal, it might be considered rude to throw away someone else's belongings, especially if they're kids' toys. The author tried leaving them there at first, then started putting them back, then moved to throwing them away. The neighbor's reaction was almost coming to blows, which shows the tension is high.\n\nThe key points here are that the author had communicated their request multiple times, the neighbors' kids continued to leave things despite the warnings, and the items were left in the yard (which the author doesn't consider their own space for the kids to use). The author's actions might be seen as enforcing their property rights, but the conflict with the neighbors complicates it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have found a more diplomatic way, like contacting the parents first or putting a sign. But given the history of issues, the author might feel justified in taking stronger action. The fact that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yard but the reverse happens could be a point in their favor.\n\nSo, considering both legal rights and the context of prior communication and conflict, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author's actions are within their rights as a property owner and they've made their boundaries clear.\n"
