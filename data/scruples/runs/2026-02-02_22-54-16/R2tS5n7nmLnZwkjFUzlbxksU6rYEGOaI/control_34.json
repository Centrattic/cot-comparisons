Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for throwing away the neighbors' toys that were left in their yard.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The neighbors don't get along with the author. Their kids have bullied the author's kids, and there was an incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear that the neighbors' kids shouldn't be in their yard or leave items there. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard or leave things there. But the neighbors' kids keep coming through the yard during games and leave items like a baseball glove, baseballs, footballs, etc. The author used to leave the items but now throws them away, which led to a conflict with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this. Let's break it down.\n\nProperty rights are a key factor here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If the neighbors left their items in the yard, the author isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's a social aspect too. Even if legally the author isn't in the wrong, socially, there might be expectations of returning lost items or at least trying to return them before disposing of them. \n\nThe author did try to return the items by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, but the neighbors didn't claim them. Then the author started throwing them away. The neighbor's dad got angry when the author threw away the glove. The author had already asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave things in their yard, so maybe they felt justified in taking this action after repeated issues.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author has made their stance clear, there might be an expectation that they would make a good-faith effort to return lost property, like placing it on the neighbor's doorstep or leaving a note. Throwing away items could be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable or if the neighbor genuinely lost them. The author might have a point in wanting to prevent the kids from using their yard again, but the method of disposal could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors have been problematic, with the kids bullying and the dog incident. The author has every right to protect their space and children. If the neighbors are not respecting the author's boundaries, the author might feel that their actions are a necessary response to enforce those boundaries.\n\nThere's a balance between property rights and community relations. Legally, the author is probably fine, but socially, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on the specific laws where they live, but since we don't have that information, we have to go with general principles.\n\nIn many places, if someone leaves items on your property, you can keep them or dispose of them after a reasonable time. However, the neighbor might argue that the items were lost, not abandoned, and thus should be returned. The author's actions could be seen as taking it too far if they immediately throw things away instead of trying to return them. But since the author had communicated their disapproval of the kids using their yard and the items were left there repeatedly without being claimed, the author might be justified in taking that final step.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they own the property and made their expectations clear. However, there's a social aspect where some might argue it's better to return items even if you're upset with the neighbors. But legally and in terms of property rights, the author is justified.\n"
