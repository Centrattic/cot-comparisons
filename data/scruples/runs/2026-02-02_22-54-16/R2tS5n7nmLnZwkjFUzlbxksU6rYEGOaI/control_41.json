Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA situation. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's been some issues with the neighbor kids bullying their kids, and a past incident where a dog scared their autistic son. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. Their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yards, though.\n\nThe neighbors' kids still walk through the author's yard to get to each other's houses, playing games and leaving items like a baseball glove, baseballs, footballs, etc. Initially, the author left the items there, but they stayed there forever without being claimed. So now, the author just throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when the baseball glove was thrown away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, the author owns their property, so they have the right to remove items from their yard. However, if those items belong to others, there are laws about property and abandonment. If the items are left unattended for a long time, they might be considered abandoned, but it's not clear if that's the case here. The author tried to return them before, but now they're just disposing of them.\n\nEthically, the author has communicated their boundaries clearly. The neighbors' kids are not respecting these boundaries by using the yard. The author is frustrated and trying to enforce their space. However, throwing away items someone else owns, even if left unattended, could be seen as harsh. There's a possible middle ground, like contacting the parents first or giving a notice before disposal.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows the tension. The author's actions might be justified in terms of property rights, but the manner could be seen as confrontational. The fact that the author tried returning items before suggests they wanted to be considerate but were ignored. Now, they're taking a more direct approach.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't just throw away someone else's property. You might need to notify the owner or leave it at a local authority. If the author hasn't done that, they could be in the wrong legally. But the question is more about moral wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author has valid reasons for wanting to keep their yard clear and safe for their autistic child. They've made their stance known. However, the act of discarding others' belongings without further communication might be seen as overstepping, even if they're in their rights. It's a gray area where legal rights meet social etiquette. The answer might hinge on whether the author can legally dispose of items or if they need to follow a specific process.\n"
