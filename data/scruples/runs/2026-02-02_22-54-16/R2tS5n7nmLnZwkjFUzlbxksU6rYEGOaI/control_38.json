Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbors don't get along with them, and there were some issues with the neighbor's kids bullying their kids. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard or leaving stuff there. Despite that, the neighbor's kids keep coming through the yard during games and leaving toys. The author used to leave the toys there but after they weren't claimed, started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor's dad got angry about a glove being thrown away.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they own their property and have the right to control what happens on it. They've communicated their boundaries clearly, so the neighbor's kids should know they're not supposed to leave stuff there. If the kids (and their parents) are ignoring those boundaries, the author has to enforce them somehow. Throwing away unclaimed items could be a way to enforce that, but it might be seen as harsh. However, since the author tried other methods first (leaving them there, then returning them), and the problem persisted, maybe they have a right to take that step. \n\nBut on the other hand, the neighbor's dad might feel that the author is being too aggressive, especially if the items are still the neighbors' property. The author is technically taking someone else's property without permission. Even if the items are left on the author's yard, the owners might not know they're there until they're gone. The author could have tried other methods like putting a notice or contacting the parents first. Also, the fact that the neighbor kids are using the yard to go between each other's houses might mean the author's yard is part of their common space, making it a bit more complicated. \n\nBut since the author has communicated their no-tolerance policy, and the neighbors are repeatedly violating those boundaries, maybe the author is justified. The key points are whether the author gave sufficient notice and if the neighbors are responsible for their kids' actions. If the parents are negligent in keeping their kids from violating the author's property, then the author's actions might be more understandable. However, the act of throwing away personal belongings could still be legally questionable, even if the author owns the property. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they've set clear boundaries and tried to handle it, but there's a legal side where taking someone else's property could be an issue. However, in many places, if you find items on your property and the owner doesn't claim them, you can dispose of them after a reasonable time. The author waited a while before throwing them away, but the neighbor parents might not have known. Still, the initial communication might have been enough. I think the consensus would lean towards the author being justified, so Answer B.\n"
