Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a history of tension between the neighbors. The writer's kids were bullied by the neighbor kids, and there was an incident with the neighbor's dog scaring the writer's autistic son. The writer made it clear they didn't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still go into the yard and leave items there. The writer initially tried putting the items back into the neighbors' yard, but now throws them away after multiple instances. The conflict escalated when the neighbor dad almost came to blows over a baseball glove being thrown away.\n\nNow, the key points here are ownership and boundaries. The writer owns their property and has a right to control who enters and what's on their land. They've communicated their boundaries multiple times. The neighbors' kids are not following those boundaries, leading to the accumulation of items. The writer's actions are a response to repeated violations of their property.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on another person's land, the landowner can dispose of it if it's abandoned. But there's also the social aspect. Even if legally allowed, the writer's actions might be seen as harsh, especially if the items aren't really abandoned but just misplaced. However, the writer's frustration is understandable given the prior issues. The neighbors' kids aren't respecting the boundaries, which could justify the writer's decision to take stronger measures.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. Throwing away items that belong to others, even if they're left in someone else's yard, can be seen as taking matters into one's own hands. The writer could have tried other methods first, like contacting the parents to ask for the items to be retrieved or putting a notice. However, the writer did mention trying to put the items back, which is a step, but it seems ineffective. The escalation to throwing them away might be seen as a reasonable step after repeated failures.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that the writer's actions are perceived as aggressive. However, considering the prior issues, the writer might feel justified. It's a balance between respecting property rights and maintaining neighborly relations. Since the neighbors aren't getting along anyway, the writer might prioritize their own boundaries over social niceties.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the writer isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their property and enforcing their wishes. The neighbors' kids are the ones repeatedly violating the boundaries. The writer's actions are a direct response to ongoing issues. However, some might argue that there's a better way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
