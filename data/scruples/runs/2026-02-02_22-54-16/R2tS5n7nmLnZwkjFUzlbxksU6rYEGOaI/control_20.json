Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left by their neighbors' kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with their kids bullying the writer's kids and a dog incident. The writer has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through, play games, and leave items. The writer initially left the items but now throws them away after multiple requests to not do that.\n\nSo, key points here. Property rights: the yard is the writer's property. Legally, they own that space. But the issue is with the items left there. When someone leaves property on your land, do they still own it? Probably, yes. So throwing away someone else's property without notification is a problem. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the neighbors' behavior. They've been told multiple times not to let their kids use the yard, but they do anyway. The writer is enforcing their boundaries by removing the items. However, throwing things away instead of returning them could be seen as going too far. \n\nThe writer tried to return items by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, which might have been a middle ground. But now they're just discarding them. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, indicating this is a sensitive issue. \n\nLegally, the writer might not be in the wrong because it's their property, but ethically, there's a question. If the items are valuable, throwing them away could be seen as destroying property. However, if they're just toys and the owner hasn't claimed them, maybe the writer's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the fact that they've been asked not to let the kids use the yard, yet the kids still do, complicates things. The writer's actions might be a reaction to the neighbors not respecting their boundaries. However, the proper approach might be to contact the parents first and ask for the items back, rather than discarding them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's their property and they're setting boundaries. But there's a gray area since they're disposing of others' belongings. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because the writer is asserting their ownership and trying to enforce their rules.\n"
