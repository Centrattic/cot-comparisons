Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The situation involves a long-standing conflict between the neighbors, with issues of the neighbor kids bullying their own and a past incident with a dog. The author has set boundaries, making it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the neighbors' kids keep coming over and leaving items. The author first tried to return items but eventually started throwing them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, property rights are a key factor here. The author owns the yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission, which is a trespassing issue. The author made their stance clear, but the neighbors didn't comply. The author's actions of removing the items could be seen as enforcing their property rights.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of neighborly relations. Even in conflict, there's an expectation of basic courtesy. The author's approach escalated from returning items to throwing them away, which might be seen as harsh. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) indicates the situation is tense. The author's justification is that they repeatedly asked the kids to stay out, so the items are considered abandoned. Legally, once property is abandoned, the owner can dispose of it. But socially, there's a nuance. The neighbor might feel slighted or not respected, especially if they didn't realize the items were left behind. \n\nThe author's actions might be defensible under property rights, but the method of disposal (throwing away without offering to return) could be seen as inconsiderate. The initial approach of returning items was more diplomatic, and moving to disposal after multiple incidents might be reasonable. However, the escalation led to conflict, which complicates the moral judgment. Balancing legal rights with social expectations is tricky here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation shows the importance of communication and finding middle ground to avoid escalation.\n"
