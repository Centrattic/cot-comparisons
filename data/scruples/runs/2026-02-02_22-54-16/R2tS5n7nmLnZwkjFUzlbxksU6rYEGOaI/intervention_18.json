Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbors' kids. The context is that the neighbors don't get along, there's been bullying, and the kids are using their yard without permission.\n\nFirst, property rights are a big factor here. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. If the neighbors' kids are entering without permission, that's a trespassing issue. The author isn't obligated to keep items left on their property, especially if they've been warned multiple times. Throwing the items away might be seen as reasonable since they're not using them and the owners aren't claiming them.\n\nBut there's also the neighbor's reaction. The dad almost came to blows over the glove. Even if the author has a right to dispose of items, the way it's handled could affect community relations. However, given the history of conflict and the lack of communication from the neighbors, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense for their space.\n\nSo, considering the repeated warnings and the neighbors' disregard, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
