Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away the toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along because they're different people. There were issues with the neighbors' kids bullying the author's kids and a previous incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving items there. The neighbors' kids still come through the yard, play games, and leave toys behind. The author used to leave the items there but eventually started throwing them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The author has communicated their boundaries\u2014no kids in the yard and no items left there. The neighbors didn't respect these boundaries. The author is taking action to enforce their property rights by removing the items. But is this action justified?\n\nLegally, property owners have the right to remove items left on their property without permission. However, there's also a social aspect. The neighbor's dad got angry, which suggests the action might have been seen as disrespectful. But the author had already asked multiple times, and the neighbors continued to ignore the requests. Throwing away items is a stronger step than returning them, which the author had done before. The escalation from returning to discarding might be where the conflict arises.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that after repeated failures to comply with their requests, they're protecting their property and their children's safety. The neighbor kids came through the yard even though it was off-limits. The author might feel justified in taking control of their space. However, throwing away items could be seen as a harsh response compared to other possible actions, like contacting the parents each time or giving a notice before disposal.\n\nBut the author did mention they tried returning the items first. The escalation to throwing them away might be a response to the neighbors' continued disregard for their boundaries. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) indicates that this action was a trigger, but the author's position is that they've been clear and the neighbors weren't listening. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't legally obligated to keep someone else's property if it's left on their land. However, the social expectation might be to return items rather than discard them. But given the hostile relationship and prior issues, the author's actions could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nI think the key here is the author's communication of boundaries and the neighbors' failure to respect them. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their property rights, especially after multiple attempts to communicate. The act of removing the items is within their rights, and the neighbors' reaction is part of the existing conflict. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
