Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for throwing away neighbor kids' toys left in their yard. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The neighbors don't get along because of personality differences. There's been bullying, and a dog incident involving the autistic son. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. The kids still come over and leave items. The author tried returning items but stopped after no response, now just throwing them away. The dad almost got into a fight because of this.\n\nNow, the main issue is ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone leaves items there without permission, does the owner have the right to dispose of them? Legally, if something is left on your property, you might have the right to discard it if the owner isn't claiming it. But there's also the social aspect. Even if legally they can do it, socially, it might be seen as harsh, especially after previous conflicts.\n\nThe author did warn them multiple times. They tried to return items but the neighbors didn't respond. So their actions could be seen as following through on their boundaries. However, throwing away someone else's property can be contentious. Maybe the author could have given more notice or tried to contact the neighbors again before discarding. The conflict with the dad suggests that the neighbors feel wronged, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing rights and relationships. The author might feel justified in protecting their space, but the action of throwing away items could be seen as a bit extreme, especially if there's a possibility of the items being wanted later. However, considering the prior issues and the lack of response to warnings, the author's actions might be understandable.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as reasonable self-defense of their property or as overstepping. Since they made their boundaries clear and tried to be accommodating first, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The neighbors' kids aren't respecting the property, so the author is acting within their rights. So answer B.\n"
