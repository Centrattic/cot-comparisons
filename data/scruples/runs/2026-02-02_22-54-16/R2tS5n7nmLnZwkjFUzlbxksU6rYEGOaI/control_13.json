Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along with them, there were past issues with bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author used to leave the items but now throws them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's property is their own, so they have a right to control who enters and what stays there. They communicated their boundaries clearly. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission and leaving items. Abandoned property can be tricky. If the items are left in the author's yard, they might be considered abandoned, so the author has a right to dispose of them. However, the neighbor might feel that the items are still their kids' and the author should return them or notify them before disposal.\n\nThe author tried to return items to the neighbors' yard before throwing them away, so they made an effort to handle it politely. The escalation to a confrontation suggests that the neighbors expect the author to hold onto the items indefinitely. But legally, once something is left on someone else's property, it's not considered abandoned until a certain period, but that varies by jurisdiction. The author's action of throwing them away might be seen as reasonable if they've given clear notice and the neighbors aren't respecting the boundaries.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect too. Even if the author has a right to do it, the neighbors might feel disrespected. The act of throwing away personal items could be seen as harsh. But the author has already communicated their stance, and the neighbors aren't heeding the warnings. So the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their property and enforcing their rules. The answer would be B (No).\n"
