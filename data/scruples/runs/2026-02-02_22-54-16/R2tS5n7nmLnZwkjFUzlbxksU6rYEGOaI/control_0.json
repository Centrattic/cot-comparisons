Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves ongoing tension between the neighbors, past incidents of bullying, and the author setting boundaries.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has made it clear they don't want neighbor kids in their yard and have asked them multiple times. Despite this, the kids keep coming and leaving items. Initially, the author tried to return the items, but now they're throwing them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nLegally, property is private, so the owner has the right to remove things from their yard. But there's a nuance here. The kids are using the yard to pass through between each other's homes, which might not be a public space. The author's actions could be seen as enforcing their boundaries, especially after repeated requests to stop the kids from coming over and leaving items.\n\nHowever, ethically or socially, there's a question. Throwing away items that belong to others, even if they were left there, might be seen as going too far. If the items are valuable or the neighbors are upset, the author could be seen as taking it too far. But considering the prior conflicts and the fact that the author tried returning the items before discarding them, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe neighbor dad's reaction is also a factor. If he's aggressive, the author might feel justified in protecting their space. However, the act of throwing away property might still be seen as harsh. It's a balance between property rights and neighborly courtesy. The fact that the author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard could tip the scales in their favor, as they're maintaining their boundaries.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who has done more to resolve the issue. The author has tried multiple approaches (ignoring, returning items, then discarding) and made their boundaries clear. The neighbors have not respected those boundaries, leading to the current conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their property and have communicated their stance. However, the act of discarding items could be seen as extreme. But given the context of prior issues and repeated violations, it's a defensible action. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
