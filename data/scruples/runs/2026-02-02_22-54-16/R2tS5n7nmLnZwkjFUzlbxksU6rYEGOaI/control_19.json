Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author, and there's been some issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has clearly told the neighbors that they don't want the kids hanging out in their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids keep going into the yard and leaving items. The author used to put the items back but now throws them away, which led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and responsibility. The author's yard is their private property. If the toys are left there without permission, does the author have the right to dispose of them? The author has communicated their boundaries, and the neighbors' kids are repeatedly ignoring those. \n\nBut wait, even if the author owns the yard, the toys belong to the neighbors. Throwing them away could be seen as destroying someone else's property. However, the neighbors' kids are trespassing by entering the yard, and the items left behind might be considered abandoned if the neighbors don't claim them quickly. \n\nThe author tried returning the items initially, but when that didn't work, they started discarding. The neighbor dad got angry, which complicates things. Legally, the author might have a right to remove trespassers' items, but ethically, it's a gray area. If the author didn't give the neighbors a final warning before throwing things away, that could be an issue. But the author did mention they had asked multiple times. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, leaving items on someone else's property might not be a crime, but the owner can ask for them to be removed. If the items are left unattended for a long time, the owner might have more leeway. However, throwing them away without giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them might be problematic. The author did try returning them before, but after the confrontation, maybe that's not an option anymore.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a tough spot. They're protecting their property from trespassing kids and dealing with a hostile neighbor. But throwing away the toys could still be seen as damaging others' property, even if it's in their yard. The answer might depend on local laws and the specific circumstances, but ethically, the author's actions are understandable given the context. However, legally, they might be on shaky ground because the toys are someone else's property. But since the neighbors' kids are trespassing and the author has made their boundaries clear, maybe it's justified. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their property from trespassing and has communicated their stance. They can't be expected to keep unclaimed items indefinitely, especially if the neighbors aren't respecting their space. The key is that the author tried to be reasonable but the neighbors didn't comply, so the author had to take action.\n"
