Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about neighbors not getting along, kids bullying, and the author throwing away toys left in their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The neighbors don't get along with the author because of differences and past issues. The kids from both sides were involved in bullying, and there was an incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids hanging out in their yard. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, but the neighbors' kids do come through and leave items. The author initially left the items but later started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor's dad over a baseball glove.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong for throwing away the items after repeated requests not to leave things in their yard. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, considering legal and social norms. Legally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might have a duty to return it. However, if there's a history of conflict and the items are left repeatedly despite being asked, the situation could be seen as different. Socially, people might view this as a personal boundary issue. The author has communicated their boundaries clearly and has taken steps to enforce them, especially after repeated infractions.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the author owns the property, they have control over it. The neighbors' kids are trespassing by entering the yard, so items left there might be considered abandoned. However, throwing away items without effort to return them could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the items have sentimental value. However, given the conflict history and prior warnings, some might argue the author is justified in protecting their property and safety.\n\nThe key factors are: clear communication of boundaries, repeated violations, and the author's actions to prevent further issues. The neighbor's dad's reaction and the potential for escalation also play a role. If the author tried to return items before throwing them away, that might show they tried to resolve the issue. Now, moving to just disposal might be a result of frustration.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are proportionate given the context. Since they've made their stance clear and the neighbors are not respecting it, the author is likely not in the wrong. But there's a counterargument about the proper handling of someone else's property. However, in a hostile situation with repeated disregard for boundaries, throwing away items might be seen as reasonable.\n"
