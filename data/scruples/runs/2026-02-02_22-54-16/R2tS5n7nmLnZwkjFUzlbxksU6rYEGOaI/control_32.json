Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying issues, and the author had a conflict with the neighbor's dog. The author made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The kids still come over and leave items, so the author first tried returning the items to the neighbor's yard but now throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo the main question is about property rights and responsibility. The author's property is being used by the neighbors' kids, and they're leaving items there. The author feels justified in removing the items since they don't want the kids on their property. But does that make them in the wrong?\n\nPossible angles: Legally, the author owns their property, so they can manage items on it as they see fit. However, morally, there's a consideration for the neighbors. The author has already asked multiple times to not leave items, which shows they tried communication. The neighbor kids are using the yard without permission, so the items are there without consent. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried contacting the parents again to reiterate the request before discarding the items. However, the neighbor dad already had an argument when the items were thrown away. The author might be within their rights, but maybe the conflict could have been avoided with a different approach. \n\nAnother point: The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so there's consistency. The author isn't doing anything their own kids would do. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and attempts to resolve. The author tried to return items initially, then escalated to throwing them away after repeated issues. The neighbor's response with threats or anger might influence the perception. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their property and have set boundaries. The neighbors' kids are trespassing in a sense, using the yard without permission. The items left behind are there without the author's consent, so removing them isn't inherently wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have given the items to the parents or a community place, but the author made their stance clear, and the neighbors didn't comply. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
