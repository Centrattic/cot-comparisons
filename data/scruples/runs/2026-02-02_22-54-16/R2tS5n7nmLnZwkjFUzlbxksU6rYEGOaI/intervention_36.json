Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away the neighbors' toys left in their yard. The situation involves a contentious relationship with the neighbors, with the author having made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids to be in their yard and to not leave things there. Despite this, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author initially left the items but eventually started throwing them away, leading to an argument with a neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has communicated boundaries: no kids in their yard and no items left there. The neighbors' kids are ignoring these boundaries, repeatedly. The author's actions are in response to this continued violation. The question is about whether throwing away the items is justified.\n\nLegally, if the author is the owner of the property, they have the right to control what's on their land. However, just because something is on their property doesn't automatically mean they can dispose of others' belongings. There might be a legal obligation to return lost property or notify the owner. But the author has made it clear they don't want the kids using the yard, so maybe there's a different perspective. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is frustrated with the neighbors' disregard for their property, but throwing away the items could be seen as harsh, especially if the neighbors are unaware of the items being discarded. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that this action is causing significant tension. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions are a reasonable response to the neighbors' repeated violations. Since the author has communicated their boundaries and the neighbors haven't respected them, the author might feel justified in taking stronger measures. However, returning the items to the neighbors' yard instead of throwing them away might be a better approach to enforce the boundary without escalating conflict. \n\nBut the author mentions that the items were left in their yard and not claimed, leading to the decision to discard. The neighbors might argue that the items were just misplaced and not lost, so the author shouldn't have thrown them away. On the other hand, the author's stance is about maintaining their property and not allowing the neighbors to use it without permission. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intention and the context. The author's intention was to enforce their boundaries and prevent the neighbors from using their property. However, the act of discarding items could be seen as going too far, especially if the neighbors didn't know the items were being disposed of. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be A or B. If the author has a right to their property and the neighbors are at fault for violating the boundaries, then B (not in the wrong) is the answer. But if the author should have returned the items or tried to communicate more, maybe A (in the wrong) is the case. \n\nGiven that the author made their boundaries clear and the neighbors continued to ignore them, the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to protect their property from being used without permission. However, the method of disposal might be the issue. Throwing away the items instead of returning them to the neighbors (even if it's just to the other yard) could be seen as not making an effort to return the items, which is a legal and ethical expectation. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author did try to return them by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, which is a way of returning. The problem arises when the author stops that and starts discarding them. The neighbor's anger suggests that this action is problematic. However, if the author is consistent in enforcing their boundaries and the items are left repeatedly, perhaps the author is justified. \n\nIn AITA circles, the community often sides with the person who's trying to maintain their boundaries, especially if the other party is not respecting them. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance in whether the author should have made more effort to return the items. Since they initially tried to return them by putting them back, and then escalated to discarding after the problem persisted, the answer could be B.\n"
