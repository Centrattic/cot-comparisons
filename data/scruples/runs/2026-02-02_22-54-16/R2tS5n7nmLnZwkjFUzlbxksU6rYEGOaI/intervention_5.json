Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor dispute where the author throws away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. The neighbors aren't on good terms, there was some bullying, and the author has already tried to set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author used to leave the items but now throws them away. There's an incident where this led to almost a confrontation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for discarding the toys after repeated requests.\n\nI should consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. However, the neighbor's kids might see the yard as a passageway between their houses, which complicates things. The author has communicated their boundaries, which is important. If the neighbors' kids are trespassing and leaving items, the author is within their rights to remove the items. But maybe the escalation (throwing away) is seen as harsh, especially if the items were accidentally left behind. However, since the author has already tried returning the items and it didn't work, they might feel justified in taking more direct action. The fact that the author's kids don't enter the neighbors' yard might show they're trying to be respectful, which balances the situation. The almost-confrontation suggests tension, but it's not entirely the author's fault if the neighbors react negatively. In many AITA scenarios, the person is often not in the wrong if they've set clear boundaries and the other party ignores them. So the answer is likely B, No.\n"
