Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author throws away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear that they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave items.\n\nFirst, property rights come into play here. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. The neighbors' kids are entering the yard without permission, which is a problem. If items are left on someone's property, the owner isn't obligated to hold onto them indefinitely. However, the author used to return the items by putting them back in the neighbor's yard, but now they just throw them away. \n\nThe key points are: The author has communicated their boundaries, the items are left on their property, and they are disposing of them. The question is whether this action is wrong. Legally, the owner can do with their property as they wish, but socially, there's a nuance. If the author had returned the items before, maybe the neighbor's frustration is because they expected the author to continue doing so. Now that the author is throwing them away, the neighbor's reaction is understandable, but the author's right to their property remains.\n\nHowever, there's a possible oversight. The author mentions that the kids are going through the yard to each other's houses. If the yard is being used as a pathway, maybe there's an implied expectation that items left there should be returned. But the author made it clear they don't want the kids there in the first place. So the author's actions are a response to the kids not respecting their boundaries. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author is standing by their decision to protect their space, especially considering past issues. However, the neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows that this is causing tension. The author might be justified in their actions, but they could have handled it differently, like contacting the parents to return the items instead of just throwing them away. \n\nStill, the author's right to their property is a strong point. They aren't obligated to keep the items, especially if the kids are trespassing and not following the set boundaries. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could have been better.\n"
