Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with kids bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming in and leaving stuff. The author used to put the items back but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor.\n\nFirst, property rights are a big factor here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission, which is a problem. The author tried to be polite by putting the items back, but when that didn't work, they moved to discarding them. \n\nBut wait, throwing away someone else's property could be an issue. Even if the items are left on the author's property, they might still belong to the neighbors. Legally, the author might need to make a reasonable effort to return the items before discarding them. The fact that the neighbors came back to ask about the glove suggests that returning them might have been the right approach. However, the author has already tried putting them back, which didn't solve the problem. \n\nEthically, the author is frustrated with the neighbors' kids not respecting their space. The author's actions are a response to ongoing issues. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, which complicates things. If the author had given more notice or tried to involve the parents first, maybe it would be different. But given the history, the author might feel justified in protecting their space and safety, especially considering the autistic son.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you might need to make a reasonable attempt to return it before getting rid of it. If the author tried returning them and the neighbors still kept coming, that might be a defense. However, the act of throwing away items could still be seen as damaging property, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might not be legally wrong because they own the property and have the right to control it. But ethically, it's a gray area. They might be justified in protecting their space, but discarding items could be seen as harsh. Since the user's question is about being in the wrong, and considering legal perspectives, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. However, the answer here needs to be A or B. Given the situation and the author's clear communication and the neighbors' continued disregard, it's more likely B.\n"
