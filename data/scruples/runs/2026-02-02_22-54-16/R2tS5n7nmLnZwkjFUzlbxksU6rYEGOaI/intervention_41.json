Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The context is that there's already tension with the neighbors. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, but the neighbors' kids often come into theirs, leaving items behind. The author tried leaving the items there first, but after multiple instances and previous confrontations, they now throw them away.\n\nHmm, so first, property rights. If the author made it clear that their yard is not for the neighbors' kids, then the kids are trespassing, maybe? But can you really prevent kids from accidentally leaving toys in someone's yard? The author has a duty to return lost property, right? Or maybe not, if they've been asked multiple times to not let the kids use their yard. \n\nThe neighbor dad almost came to blows over the baseball glove. That's a sign of significant irritation. But the author did ask them not to leave things there. If the items are left on the property, does the author have the right to dispose of them? Or should they make an effort to return them? \n\nAlso, the kids are probably not old enough to understand property boundaries. The parents are responsible here. The author could be seen as trying to enforce their space, but maybe they should still return the items to avoid conflict. However, the author mentions that the items stayed there forever without being claimed, so maybe the parents aren't taking responsibility. \n\nIn many places, if you find something on your property, you should make reasonable attempts to return it. But the author has been told multiple times and still the kids keep coming in. If the parents are aware and still don't supervise, maybe the author isn't obligated to keep returning the items. \n\nBut throwing them away immediately might be seen as harsh. Maybe the author should try a different approach, like putting a note on the item or contacting the parents to arrange a return. However, given the existing bad rapport, that might not be feasible. \n\nThe author's actions could be justified if the neighbors' kids are repeatedly trespassing and not respecting boundaries. The author is trying to set a clear line. On the other hand, the neighbor dad's reaction is extreme, but the author might not be in the wrong if they're standing up for their property after repeated issues.\n"
