Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors are not on good terms, there was bullying, and the author has set boundaries.\n\nFirst, property rights are a key point here. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. If items are left on their property, they have the right to dispose of them, especially if the owners don't claim them. The neighbors left items there multiple times, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it. Throwing them away might be seen as harsh, but the author tried other methods first, like leaving them and then moving them back. When that didn't work, they escalated. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, which might be their own issue. The author's actions could be seen as self-preservation, maintaining their space. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
