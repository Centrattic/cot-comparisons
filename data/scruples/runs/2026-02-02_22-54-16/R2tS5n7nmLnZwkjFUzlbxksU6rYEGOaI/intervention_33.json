Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer's neighbors don't get along with them. There have been issues with the neighbor kids bullying the writer's kids, and a past incident with a dog. The writer has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The writer's kids don't go into the neighbors' yards. Despite being asked, the neighbor kids keep coming into the yard and leaving items. The writer used to put the items back but now just throws them away, leading to a conflict with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the key points are: the writer owns their property, set boundaries, and the neighbors' kids are ignoring those boundaries. The writer is taking action by disposing of the items, which the neighbors don't like.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away without returning it, but if it's abandoned, maybe it's different. However, morally, the writer might feel justified because the neighbors weren't respecting their space. The writer tried to be polite by putting items back first. The fact that the items stayed there for a long time without being claimed might support the writer's decision.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle someone else's property. Even if it's on your property, taking it away without notice could be seen as harsh, especially if the items have sentimental value. The neighbor's reaction was almost a physical fight, which indicates deep-seated issues beyond just the toys.\n\nThe writer's actions might be seen as a stand-up for their property rights and boundaries, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like sending the items to the neighbors via mail or another method. However, the neighbors' kids were repeatedly ignoring the writer's requests, so the writer feels it's justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they've set boundaries and the neighbors aren't respecting them. The writer's actions are a response to ongoing issues and attempts to maintain their space. The fact that the items were left recklessly and not claimed supports the writer's position. The key is mutual respect for property, and the neighbors weren't respecting the writer's property, so the writer is taking reasonable steps to protect their own.\n"
