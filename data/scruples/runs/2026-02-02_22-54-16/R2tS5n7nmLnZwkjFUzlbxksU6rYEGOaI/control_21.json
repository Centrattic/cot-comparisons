Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying and a past incident with the dog. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The kids still go there and leave items. The author started throwing away the items after previous attempts to return them failed.\n\nSo the main issue is property rights and the author's right to control their own yard. Legally, if items are left on someone's property, the owner can dispose of them, especially after giving notice. The author did mention not wanting the kids in their yard, so they've set boundaries. However, the neighbor's reaction led to a confrontation. \n\nBut maybe the author should have given more warnings before throwing things away? Or perhaps tried to communicate better with the neighbors? However, the context says they don't speak and the author is ignoring them. The neighbor's kids aren't following the author's rules, so the author is enforcing their space. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the kids being young; maybe the author should consider that the kids might not realize they're taking items into the yard. But the author has already tried returning the items, and the neighbors didn't take responsibility. \n\nLegally, the author has the right to remove items from their property. However, socially, it might be seen as harsh, but given the conflict and prior warnings, it's a matter of self-responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their space after clear communication.\n"
