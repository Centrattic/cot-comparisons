Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves some history of bad relations between the neighbors, including incidents with kids bullying their children and a dog scaring the autistic son.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids are using the yard as a path and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items there but they just stayed, so they started returning them to the neighbors' yard. Now they throw them away. There was a confrontation when a glove was thrown away, leading to tension with the neighbor Dad.\n\nThe key points here are property ownership and boundaries. Legally, the author owns their yard, and objects left there without permission could be considered trespassing. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. The author has a right to their property, especially after setting boundaries. But the neighbors might feel entitled to retrieve these items, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as reasonable for maintaining their property, given the prior issues. But throwing away possessions without notice might be seen as harsh. However, the author did communicate their stance beforehand. The neighbor's frustration is understandable, but so is the author's desire to enforce their boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their space and property. The answer is B.\n"
