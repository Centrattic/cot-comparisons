Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's neighbors don't get along with them. There was bullying of their kids and an incident with a dog scaring the autistic son. The author made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving items there. However, the kids still come through the yard to each other's houses, playing games and leaving stuff. The author used to put items back but now just throws them away. One time, this led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for throwing away the items after having asked the neighbors not to leave things in their yard.\n\nI need to think about property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If items are left there, they can dispose of them. But there might be nuances. The author did warn the neighbors not to leave things, but the neighbors didn't comply. The author tried putting items back initially, which is a reasonable step. Then moving to throwing them away could be seen as their right since they've made it clear they don't want the items. However, the neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) complicates things. Maybe there's a communication issue. But legally, the author has the right to remove items from their property once they're there. The fact that the neighbors are not listening to the author's requests might make the author's actions justified. However, the author might have a responsibility to notify the neighbors before disposal, but if the items are left indefinitely and the author has already taken steps like putting them back, throwing them away after multiple attempts could be reasonable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
