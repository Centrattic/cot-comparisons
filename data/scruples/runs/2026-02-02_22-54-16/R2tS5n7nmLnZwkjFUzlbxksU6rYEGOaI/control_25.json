Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along with them, and there have been issues with their kids bullying the author's kids. The author's wife was upset when the neighbor's dog wasn't leashed, leading to more tension.\n\nThe author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbor's kids in their yard and not to leave things there. The kids still come through the yard during games and leave items like baseball gloves, balls, etc. The author used to leave the toys but now throws them away immediately. There was a confrontation with the neighbor Dad when he found out a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is at fault for discarding the toys after repeated requests. Property rights are a factor here. The author owns their yard and can control it. They've given explicit instructions, but the neighbors are ignoring them. The author is trying to enforce their boundaries. On the other hand, the neighbor's kids might not realize they're not supposed to leave the toys, especially if they're just playing. But the author has communicated their stance. The neighbor Dad's reaction was aggressive, but the author's action is about their own property. It's a conflict between property rights and neighborly obligations. The author isn't keeping the toys for themselves, just getting rid of them. So maybe they're justified. But some might argue that they should return the items instead of throwing them away. However, since the neighbor is being hostile and the kids keep coming in, the author might feel returning the items is futile. The answer likely leans towards B (No), as the author is protecting their property after setting clear boundaries.\n"
