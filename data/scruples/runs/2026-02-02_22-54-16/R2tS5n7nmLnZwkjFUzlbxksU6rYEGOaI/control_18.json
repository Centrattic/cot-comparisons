Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's been past issues like kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard. However, the neighbor kids keep using the yard for their games and leaving items behind. The author first left the items there, but when that didn't work, started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for discarding the toys. Legally, the author owns their property, so they have the right to refuse entry and remove items left on their land. However, morally, there's a nuance here. The author has communicated their boundaries, but the neighbors' kids are still using the yard, which could be seen as trespassing. The author's response is to discard the items, which might be seen as reasonable since the items are left on their property and the owner has the right to dispose of them if they're considered abandoned.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of neighborly relations. Even though there's a feud, some might argue that returning the items instead of throwing them away is more considerate, even if the neighbors are problematic. However, the author tried returning them but that didn't work. The neighbor kids kept leaving things, and the author felt it was necessary to take a firmer stance. The author's actions could be seen as a way to enforce their boundaries after multiple requests. \n\nAnother angle is the children's ownership of the items. If the toys are left on the property, technically, the author could argue that unclaimed items after a certain period can be disposed of. But the neighbor dad's reaction suggests that he might not agree, leading to potential conflict. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is within their legal rights. The moral aspect depends on whether you prioritize strict boundary enforcement over maintaining some level of neighborly courtesy, even with difficult neighbors. Since the author tried to communicate and the neighbors didn't comply, the author's response seems justified. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
