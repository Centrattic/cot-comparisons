Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The context is that there's a history of conflict with the neighbors, including kids bullying their children and a previous incident with a dog.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming over and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, so they moved them back, then started throwing them away. There was even a near-confrontation when they threw away a glove.\n\nNow, considering property rights, the author owns their yard. If items are left there without permission, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. But there's a social aspect too. Even though the author has the right to dispose of the items, the neighbors might feel it's inconsiderate, especially if the kids are young and the items are expensive. The author could be seen as being strict, but they've communicated their boundaries clearly.\n\nThe key points: Did the author respect their own property rights? Yes. Did they give the neighbors chances to retrieve items? Initially yes, by moving them back. Then, after repeated issues, they moved to disposal. The neighbors might not have respected the author's boundaries, so the author is within their rights to take action.\n\nHowever, the confrontation (almost coming to blows) adds a layer. While the author isn't in the wrong legally, maybe socially they could be seen as harsh. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer hinges on legal/property rights vs. social considerations. The author has the right to remove items from their property, so the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
