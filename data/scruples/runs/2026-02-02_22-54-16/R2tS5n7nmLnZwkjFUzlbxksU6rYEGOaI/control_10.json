Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's a history of the neighbor's kids bullying their own kids and some incidents with a dog. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbor's kids in their yard. The author's kids are respectful and don't go into the neighbors' yards. However, the neighbor's kids often pass through the author's yard to get to each other's houses, leaving items behind. Initially, the author left the items, but after they were neglected, the author started throwing them back, then eventually started throwing them away. This led to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their private property. If items are left there without permission, the author could be within their rights to dispose of them, especially after having communicated their boundaries. However, the neighbors might argue that the items belong to them, even if left on the author's property.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of community relations. The author has a tense relationship with the neighbors. While the author has a right to their property, the manner in which they handle the situation might affect their reputation. Throwing away items could be seen as harsh, especially if the items were valuable or had sentimental value. However, the author did attempt to return the items before discarding them, which shows some consideration.\n\nLegally, the author owns the property, so they can control what stays there. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions might be justified given the history of conflict and the lack of communication from the neighbors. However, escalating tensions by confronting the neighbor physically (almost coming to blows) complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for balance between legal rights and social etiquette. The author's actions are understandable given the circumstances, but the way they handled it (throwing away items without returning them) might be seen as overstepping, especially if the neighbors feel their property was mishandled without due process.\n\nBut considering the author made their boundaries clear and the neighbors' kids continued to leave items, the author's response is a form of self-preservation. It's a tough spot, but the author might not be in the wrong because they are protecting their space after setting clear expectations.\n"
