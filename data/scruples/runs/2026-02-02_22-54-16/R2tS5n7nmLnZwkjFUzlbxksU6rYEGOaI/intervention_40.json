Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has neighbors they don't get along with. The neighbors' kids were bullying their kids, and there was an incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. The author made it clear that they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids still come through the yard and leave items. The author used to return the items but now throws them away. One neighbor got angry when they found out about the glove being thrown away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but they want my take. \n\nLegal perspective: Property rights. If the items are left on the author's property, they might have the right to dispose of them if they're considered abandoned. However, in some places, there might be laws about abandoned property, requiring a certain period of time before you can claim or discard. But the story says the author used to leave them but after they weren't claimed, started throwing them away. So maybe they did wait, but after a while.\n\nEthical perspective: The author has communicated their boundaries clearly. The neighbors didn't respect those boundaries, so the author is taking action to enforce them. However, throwing away items could be seen as harsh. The alternative is to return the items, which the author tried but the problem continued. Now, they just discard them. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests the author's actions are offensive. \n\nThe author's intent was to protect their space and kids. They've made their position clear. The neighbors aren't respecting that, so the author is acting in self-defense of their property. But maybe the author could have given a longer grace period or tried to resolve it through another method. However, the story says they've asked multiple times. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, community often considers clear communication and proportional response. If the author communicated their wishes and the neighbors continued to ignore them, then the author's actions are a reasonable response. The act of throwing away items might be seen as justified, especially if the items are left unattended. So the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). \n\nBut there's a nuance: even if legally they can dispose of the items, ethically, maybe they should return them or leave them for a longer period. However, given the context of a hostile relationship and previous issues, the author's actions are about maintaining their own space. So the community might side with the author here."
