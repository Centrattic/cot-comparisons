Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The neighbors don't get along with the author, there's been some bullying issues with their kids, and a past incident with the dog. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. The kids still enter the yard and leave items. The author initially left the items but then started returning them to the neighbor's yard, and now throws them away. There was a heated moment when the neighbor dad found out about the thrown-away glove. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the main question is about property rights and boundaries. The author owns their yard and has the right to control who enters and what stays there. They gave clear instructions not to leave things in their yard. However, when the neighbors ignore these instructions, the author is trying to enforce their boundaries by removing the items. \n\nNow, legal perspective: In many places, if someone leaves items on your property, you can't just throw them away without trying to return them first. But the author did try returning them initially. Now, they're throwing them away. Legally, maybe there's a gray area. But from a community and neighborly standpoint, even if the neighbors are problematic, throwing away items might be seen as harsh. However, the author has a right to their property.\n\nEmotionally, the author might be frustrated due to past issues. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows that the action caused tension. But the author's action is a response to repeated violations of their property. \n\nIn AITA stories, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The author's intention was to protect their property and enforce boundaries after multiple requests. They didn't use the items, just disposed of them. The neighbor's kids didn't claim the items, so the author might feel justified. \n\nHowever, some might argue that throwing away items is a final action and could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the neighbors are difficult. There's a balance between standing up for one's property and being considerate in a community. But since the neighbors were already not getting along, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to communicate, and when ignored, took reasonable steps to protect their property. Therefore, answer B.\n"
