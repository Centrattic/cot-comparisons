Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who throws away their neighbor's toys is in the wrong. The context is that there's some tension between the families. The main points are:\n\nFirst, the neighbors don't get along due to personality differences and past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author tried returning the items but now just throws them away, leading to an argument with the neighbor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, property owners have the right to remove items left on their premises, especially if they've been asked not to have the items there. But there's also the social aspect. Even if it's legal, it's a neighborly issue. The author tried returning the items at first, which shows they tried to be considerate. The problem is the neighbors aren't respecting the property boundaries, which the author has a right to enforce.\n\nHowever, throwing things away without trying to return them directly might be seen as harsh. But the author mentions they've done it after multiple requests. The neighbor's dad got upset, but the author was upfront about it. The key here is that the author established boundaries and the neighbors didn't respect them. The author's actions are a reasonable response to protect their space, especially after prior attempts to handle it more kindly.\n\nSo, considering both legal rights and the social context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They took reasonable steps to maintain their property and respect their own boundaries after the neighbors didn't comply with requests.\n"
