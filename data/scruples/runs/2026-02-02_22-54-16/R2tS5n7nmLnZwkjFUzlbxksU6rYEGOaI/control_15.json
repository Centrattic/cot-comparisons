Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author, there's a history of the neighbor's kids bullying the author's kids, and a previous incident with a dog. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite this, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author used to put the items back but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, legally, property rights are a factor. If the items are left on the author's property, the author might have the right to dispose of them, especially if the owners are neglectful. However, there's a social aspect too. The author has communicated their boundaries, so the kids are choosing to ignore them. But the act of throwing things away might be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable or the neighbors want them back. The confrontation with the neighbor's dad complicates things. Even if the author has the legal right, the social etiquette might require returning the items rather than discarding them, unless there's a clear agreement that items left behind become the property of the landowner. Also, the author's kids don't leave items in the neighbors' yards, so there's a double standard if the author is strict about their own property but not reciprocating. However, given the history of issues, the author might feel justified in protecting their space. The key points are the communication of boundaries, the neighbors' continued disregard, and the author's response. The answer hinges on whether the author's action is seen as a reasonable response to the neighbors' repeated violations of their stated boundaries. If the neighbors kept the items in their own yard, maybe, but they're taking advantage of the author's yard. Still, the act of throwing things away could be seen as going too far, even if the author has the right. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, maybe not; socially, maybe. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might depend on the community norms. In some places, abandoned items on someone else's property can be disposed of, but others might expect you to return them. Since the author has already tried returning them and the neighbors ignored it, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the escalation to a confrontation suggests that the neighbors value the items, so maybe the author should have a different approach, like leaving a note or using a lost and found. But the author's action is a response to repeated offenses. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with a caveat that there might be a better way to handle it. However, given the situation and the author's clear communication, they might be justified.\n"
