Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for throwing away toys their neighbors left in their yard. The context is that there's a conflict with the neighbors, including past issues with their kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident. The author has set boundaries by telling the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. Despite that, the neighbors' kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author initially left the items but eventually started throwing them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: Property ownership. The author's yard is their property. If someone leaves items on your property without permission, you have the right to dispose of them after a reasonable notice. The author did give multiple warnings, so it's within their rights legally. \n\nThen, the moral side. The neighbors' kids are using the yard as a shortcut, which is disrespectful. The author tried to be polite by initially returning items but eventually had to enforce the rule. Throwing away items that are left behind, especially after clear communication, could be seen as reasonable self-defense of their space. However, throwing something away that might still have value to the other person could be seen as harsh. But given the prior conflicts and the fact that the items were left in the yard repeatedly, the author's actions are understandable.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows that there's existing tension. The author's actions might escalate the conflict, but if they've tried to communicate clearly and the neighbors aren't respecting the boundaries, the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting their property. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong. They've given prior notice and the neighbors aren't complying, so disposing of the items is justified.\n"
