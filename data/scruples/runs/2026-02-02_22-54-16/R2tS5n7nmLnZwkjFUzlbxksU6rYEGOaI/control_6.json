Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. The background is that the neighbors don't get along with them, and there's been some issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has clearly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. The kids keep going through the yard during games, leaving items behind. The author initially left the items but got tired of them staying forever, so they started throwing them back, and now just throw them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are property rights and communication. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens there. They've made their stance clear to the neighbors\u2014no kids in the yard, and if they leave items, those items will be dealt with. The neighbors' kids are not following this, which leads to the author taking action. However, the author is now disposing of the items, which the neighbors are finding out about and being upset.\n\nBut is throwing away the items a reasonable response? The author could argue that they've given multiple warnings and that the items are left indefinitely, implying that the owners aren't coming to claim them. However, the neighbors might see this as theft or destruction of their property. Even if the items are left behind, legally, someone else taking them could be considered theft. The author is on their own property, but taking another person's belongings could be problematic. \n\nThe neighbors might not have been properly notified in writing, so maybe there's a lack of clear communication. The author could be seen as acting unilaterally without giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve the items. Alternatively, the author might be justified in removing items that are left in their yard as trespassing. \n\nBut considering that the items belong to the neighbors, the author doesn't have the right to destroy or discard them without consent. Even if the items are considered abandoned, the legal line might be blurry. The author could be in the wrong because they are taking property that isn't theirs. However, if the neighbors left the items there with the knowledge that the author didn't want them, maybe the responsibility lies with the neighbors for not retrieving them. \n\nIn terms of social norms, the author might be seen as overstepping by throwing away items, especially if there's a history of conflict. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows that this is a sensitive issue. Maybe a better approach would be to put a note or a sign, or involve a mediator. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong because they are disposing of others' property without a clear legal justification, despite prior communication issues. So answer A.\n"
