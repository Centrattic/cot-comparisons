Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys their neighbor kids left in their yard. The background is that there's already tension between the families. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming through and leaving items.\n\nFirst, property rights are a big part of this. The author owns the yard, so anything left in it is technically on their property. The question is whether throwing away someone else's items is allowed. Legally, if you find property on your land, you might have a duty to return it, but if the owner hasn't claimed it after a reasonable time, you might be justified in disposing of it. But the author says they tried to return items before by putting them back, and when that didn't work, they started throwing them away.\n\nThe neighbor had a confrontational reaction, even considering violence, which escalates the situation. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the prior issues, might be seen as hostile. However, the neighbor's kids were repeatedly entering the yard despite the author's clear requests, which is a breach of property boundaries. \n\nThe author's main issue is the unauthorized use of their property and the continuous littering. The legal side could be murky because even if the items are on their property, there might be a process to follow before disposal. But given the context of prior bullying and the neighbor's aggressive reaction, the author might feel justified. \n\nOn the other hand, throwing away items could be seen as an act of retaliation, especially since the kids are minors. The author might be advised to contact the parents first, give a final notice, and then dispose if necessary. But in this case, the author did attempt to return items initially. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as reasonable given the prior conflicts and the neighbor's failure to respect the property boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation more formally, perhaps through legal channels like contacting the city or sending a formal notice before disposal.\n"
