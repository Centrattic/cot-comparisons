Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming over and leaving stuff. The author used to return the items but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens there. If someone leaves items on your property, you're allowed to take them away, right? But maybe there's a nuance. The author has communicated their wishes, so the kids ignoring that might be an issue. The author is taking action because the neighbors are not respecting their space. \n\nHowever, throwing away items might be seen as harsh. The parents might expect the items to be returned. The author's justification is that the neighbors kept ignoring their requests, so they decided to take a stronger action. The question is whether this action is reasonable. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away; you might need to hold onto it for a certain period. But the author tried returning them before, and since the neighbors didn't claim them, maybe they're within their rights now. \n\nThe fact that there's a history of conflict complicates things. The author is protecting their space, especially considering their autistic son was scared by the dog. The parents might not be handling their kids properly, leaving the items around. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on both legal rights and social norms. Legally, they might have a right to remove items after a certain period. Socially, throwing away items without notice might be seen as over the top, but given the prior issues, maybe it's understandable. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I tend to agree. The key points are the prior communication, the repeated disregard for the author's wishes, and the safety of their child. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
