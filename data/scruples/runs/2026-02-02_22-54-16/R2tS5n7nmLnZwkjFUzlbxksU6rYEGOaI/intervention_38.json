Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has told the neighbors not to have their kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming in and leaving items.\n\nThe author used to leave the items but now just throws them away. One incident escalated with the neighbor dad almost coming to blows. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, property rights. The author's yard is their property. They have the right to control what happens there. If people leave items on their property, legally they might own them, but in reality, those items are often considered abandoned if not claimed. So the author isn't necessarily doing anything illegal by disposing of them.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Even if it's legal, the neighbors might feel disrespected. The author has a history of conflict with the neighbors, so this action could be seen as a continuation of that tension. However, the author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. If the neighbors' kids are repeatedly violating that boundary, the author's response is a way to enforce those rules.\n\nThe problem arises when the neighbor confronts the author. The author's response of throwing things away without returning them might be seen as dismissive or confrontational. Throwing items back might have been a middle ground, but throwing them away entirely could be perceived as taking it too far, especially if the items have sentimental value.\n\nBut the author also mentions that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so they're enforcing a one-way boundary. The neighbors' kids keep entering, so the author is trying to maintain control over their space. The escalation with the neighbor dad suggests that communication isn't working, and the author's actions are causing further conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong in enforcing their property rights. However, the way they handle the situation could be more considerate. Maybe returning the items with a note next time instead of throwing them away, but since the neighbor Dad had a confrontation, the author might feel justified in protecting their space.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to their property and the boundaries they set, even if it strains relationships. The neighbors' kids are repeatedly violating those boundaries, so the author's actions are a response to ongoing issues.\n"
