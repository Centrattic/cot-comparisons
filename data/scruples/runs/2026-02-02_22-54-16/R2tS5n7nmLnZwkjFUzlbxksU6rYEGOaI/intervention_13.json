Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation is a bit tense because there's a history of conflict with the neighbors. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming in and leaving items. They tried returning the items but eventually started throwing them away, which led to an altercation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If items are left there, the owner can dispose of them after a reasonable amount of time, especially if the owners aren't claiming them. But there might be a legal aspect here too. In some places, you might need to give notice before disposing of someone else's property, even on your land. Did the author do that? They mentioned they asked multiple times, so maybe that's sufficient.\n\nThen there's the neighbor's perspective. The kids might not realize they're crossing into the author's yard, or maybe they do but don't care. The author tried to be polite by returning the items initially, but after repeated issues, they stopped. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate they didn't handle it well. However, the act of throwing away items that belong to others could be seen as overstepping, even if the items were left in the yard. The author could have documented the items or given a final notice before disposal.\n\nBut the key points are that the author made their boundaries clear, the items were left without permission, and the neighbor's kids kept violating the property. The author's actions are a reaction to ongoing issues. In terms of right or wrong, the author's property rights are on their side, but maybe there's a more diplomatic way to handle it. However, given the context of the bad relationship, it's understandable why the author would take that action. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
