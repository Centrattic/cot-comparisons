Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves neighbors' kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after previous warnings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission and leaving items behind. The author initially tried to return the items but when that didn't work, started throwing them away. \n\nThe key points here are the author's attempts to address the issue first. They set boundaries, communicated their request, and tried returning the items. When that didn't stop the problem, they escalated. But is throwing away someone else's property justified? Legally, if the items are left on the property, the owner might have the right to dispose of them after notice, but it's a gray area. \n\nSocially, it's about how others might perceive the action. The neighbor reacted angrily, leading to a confrontation. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to enforce their space, especially after repeated issues with the kids. However, some might argue that throwing away items could be harsh, even if the property is yours. \n\nAlso, the underlying tension with the neighbors plays a role. The author mentions prior conflicts, which might make their actions more understandable as self-protection. The act of throwing away the glove led to almost a physical altercation, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author tried to be polite and gave multiple warnings. If the neighbors didn't respect the boundaries, the author's frustration is valid. But the final action of disposal might be seen as cutting off the problem to protect their own space, which could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They protected their property after setting clear boundaries. The answer would be B (No).\n"
