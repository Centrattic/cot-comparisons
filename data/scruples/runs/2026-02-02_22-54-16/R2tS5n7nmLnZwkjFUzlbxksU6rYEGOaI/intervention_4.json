Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The context is that the neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author has set boundaries. The neighbors' kids keep leaving items in the yard despite being told not to. The author first tried returning the items but now throws them away.\n\nHmm. So, legally, the author's property is their own, and if someone leaves items there, they might be considered abandoned. So the author might have the right to dispose of them. But there's the interpersonal aspect. The neighbor dad almost came to blows with the author, which suggests that this is a sensitive issue. Even if legally the author is in the right, the social consequences could be worse. \n\nThe author did try to communicate their boundaries by returning the items first. Then after that didn't work, they started throwing things away. But the neighbors are upset because their kids lost items. Maybe the author could have tried another approach, like sending the items to the neighbor's house or contacting the parents first. But the author might feel that the neighbors aren't respecting their property, so they're justified in defending their space. \n\nOn the other hand, throwing away something someone else owns, even if it's in your yard, could be seen as rude or aggressive, especially if it leads to conflict. The author's actions might be seen as overreacting, even if they have a point about their property. The fact that there's a history of not getting along might mean that the author's actions are contributing to the tension rather than resolving it. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on perspective. Legally, maybe not in the wrong. Socially, maybe there's a better way to handle it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the answer options are A for yes and B for no. Considering all that, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their property after setting clear boundaries, even though the approach could be improved. The key is that the author communicated their wishes and the neighbors didn't comply, leading to the author's actions.\n"
