Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbors' kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after repeated requests to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. If the toys are left on the author's property, technically, they own the land, so they have the right to dispose of items left there. But there's a social aspect here. Throwing away someone else's belongings can be seen as harsh, especially if there's a chance the items might be found and claimed later.\n\nThe neighbors are hostile, and the kids have a history of bullying. The author tried to be polite by initially leaving the items and then tossing them back into the neighbors' yard. But after that didn't work, they started throwing them away. That led to a confrontation with the neighbor Dad. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, the author isn't obligated to keep someone else's lost items. However, in some places, there might be laws about lost property. If the items are considered lost rather than abandoned, the owner might have a claim. But if the items are left in the yard for a long time without the owner retrieving them, they might be considered abandoned. \n\nSocially, it's a gray area. The author has a right to their property, but the way they handle it could affect relationships. The fact that the neighbors are already not on good terms with the author complicates things. The author's actions might be justified given the prior issues, but the confrontational approach (throwing them away instead of returning) could be seen as the last straw. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, maybe not. Socially, it's a bit of a judgment call. The AITA community often looks at both legal and social norms. Since the author clearly communicated their boundaries and the neighbors ignored them, the author's actions could be seen as reasonable. However, the immediate disposal without a final warning might be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), especially considering the prior issues with the neighbors and the repeated disregard for the author's wishes. The key points are communication and the neighbors' lack of cooperation. The author took escalating steps after initial tolerance, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
