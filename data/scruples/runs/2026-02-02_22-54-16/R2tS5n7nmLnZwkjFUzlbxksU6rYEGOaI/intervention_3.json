Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves neighbors whose kids leave toys in their yard, and the author throws them away after multiple requests to not do so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The neighbors have a tense relationship, there was bullying, and the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The author's kids follow the rules, but the neighbors' kids don't. The author used to return the items but now throws them away, leading to an argument with the neighbor dad.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves items on your property, you can dispose of them after a reasonable time, especially if you've notified the other party. The author tried to return items but that didn't work, so escalating to throwing them away makes sense. However, the neighbor might feel disrespected by the author's actions, even if it's justified. \n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is understandable given the prior issues. They set boundaries, and the neighbors aren't respecting them. The author's actions are a reaction to ongoing problems. The neighbor's anger about the glove might be more about feeling disrespected than the item itself.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have given more warnings or tried to communicate better, even if they eventually threw things away. However, the story says they asked multiple times. So the author is enforcing their own property rules, which others aren't following. That's a gray area. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their space and have taken steps to communicate their boundaries. The neighbor's kids aren't respecting those, so the author's actions are a response to that disregard. So the answer is B.\n"
