Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away. The neighbors have a history of not getting along, with incidents of bullying and a dog incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author made it clear that they don't want the kids in their yard, and the kids are still coming in and leaving items. Legally, if the items are left on someone's property and not claimed, the owner has the right to dispose of them. But there might be a social expectation to return them, especially if the items are still usable and the owner didn't make an effort to return them.\n\nThe author mentions they used to leave the items but they stayed out there forever. So maybe they felt it was better to throw them away than to keep them. However, when they started throwing them away, it led to a conflict with the neighbor Dad. The key points here are the prior communication (the author asked the neighbors not to have their kids in the yard), the repeated nature of the issue, and the neighbor's reaction.\n\nIn the US, property owners can generally dispose of unclaimed items, but it's often advised to make an effort to return them, especially if they're from children. The author tried returning them by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, but now just throws them away. The neighbor's aggressive reaction might be due to feeling that their property was being trespassed upon again, but the author's yard is their own, so entering to return the items could be seen as trespassing too.\n\nHowever, the author's actions might be perceived as being spiteful or retaliatory, especially given the existing tensions. Even though the author communicated their wishes, the act of throwing away the items without further attempts to return them could be seen as going beyond reasonable disposal. The neighbor's kids are using the yard for their games, which the author has to tolerate, but the unclaimed items are a different issue.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author gave the neighbors sufficient opportunity to retrieve the items. If they were thrown back before and the neighbors didn't collect them, then throwing them away might be justified. But maybe the author should have tried to contact the neighbors again to inform them rather than just discarding the items. However, the author's boundary was to not have the neighbors' kids in their yard, and the items are a consequence of that. So the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. The answer is likely B (No), as the author has the right to control their property and the neighbor's kids were already violating the established boundary.\n"
