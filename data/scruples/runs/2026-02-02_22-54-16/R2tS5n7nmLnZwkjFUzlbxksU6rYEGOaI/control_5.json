Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. The situation involves ongoing tension between the families, with the neighbors not getting along. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming and leaving items behind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property ownership. The author's yard is their private property, so they have the right to control what happens there. If someone leaves items on your property, you can choose to return them or dispose of them. But there's a nuance here: the author has already tried to return the items by throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, and now they're just throwing them away. \n\nThe key point is communication. The author mentioned they've asked the neighbors multiple times to keep their kids out and not leave things. However, the neighbors might still have a claim that the toys are their children's property. Even if the items are left on the author's property, the parents could argue that they have ownership. But since the items were left behind, the author might not be obligated to keep them indefinitely. \n\nAnother angle is the confrontation with the neighbor's dad. That suggests that the neighbors are aware of the author's actions, which could imply the author isn't being discreet. However, if the author has given clear warnings and the neighbors continue to leave items, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable. \n\nLegally, in many places, if someone leaves personal property on your land, you can store it or dispose of it after a reasonable time. But the exact legal stance can vary. Since the author is in the US (given the context of AITA being a Reddit forum), the general rule might be that you can dispose of items after notifying the owner. However, the author hasn't notified the neighbors before throwing them away, just returned them once and then started discarding. \n\nEthically, the situation is more about social norms. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable given the past issues. However, throwing items away without giving the neighbors a chance might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents aren't the ones leaving the items. The kids might not realize they should retrieve their toys. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as justified because they've communicated their boundaries and the neighbors haven't respected them. On the other hand, the neighbor might feel the author is being overly strict, especially if the items are expensive or sentimental. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they own the property and have the right to manage it as they see fit, especially after setting clear boundaries. The neighbors' kids are the ones repeatedly violating those boundaries by entering and leaving items. The author's response, while firm, is a way to enforce their property rights. So the answer would be B, not at fault.\n"
