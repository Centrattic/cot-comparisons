Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbors don't get along with them. There's been some bullying by the neighbor's kids, and there's a past incident where the neighbor's dog scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving stuff there. The kids still come through, leave toys, and the author used to put them back but now just throws them away. There was an altercation when the neighbor dad found out.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: If someone leaves property on your yard, technically it's still their property. So the author might not have the right to dispose of it. Normally, you have a duty to protect someone else's property until they claim it. So throwing it away could be seen as interfering with their property. However, if they've repeatedly been told not to leave things there, maybe there's some legal argument about abandonment. But I'm not sure how that works. Maybe if the items are left there without permission, they could be considered abandoned after a certain time. But the author just starts throwing them away after a while. \n\nMoral perspective: The author's kids are kept out of the neighbors' yard, so there's some consistency. The author is trying to protect their space, especially due to past issues with the kids and the dog. The neighbor kids are using the yard as a path, which the author didn't agree to. The author might feel justified in protecting their property and ensuring their kids aren't harmed again. On the other hand, the neighbor dad might see the author as being overly harsh, especially if the kids are just playing and not intentionally leaving things. \n\nCommunication aspect: The author did make their boundaries clear, but maybe there's a lack of communication. If the neighbor kids keep coming through, maybe the author should have discussed it again or found another way to handle the items, like storing them temporarily and contacting the parents. Throwing away without notice might be seen as rude or aggressive, especially after a previous altercation. \n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might be in the wrong because they're disposing of property that's not theirs. Morally, there's some justification due to the history of issues, but the method of handling it could be seen as confrontational. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some places, people might prioritize property rights, while others might value community relations. Since the neighbor dad reacted strongly, maybe the author crossed a line. But the original boundary setting was clear, so the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to ongoing disrespect. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they made their boundaries known and the neighbors are not respecting them, but there's a legal angle. However, in the end, the author is within their rights to enforce their property, but maybe the method is questionable. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because the author is protecting their space after being asked to stay out.\n"
