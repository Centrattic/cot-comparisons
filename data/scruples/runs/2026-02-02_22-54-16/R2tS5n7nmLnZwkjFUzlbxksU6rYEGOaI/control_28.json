Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's a history of bullying and a previous incident with a dog. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The kids keep leaving items, and the author eventually started throwing them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens on it. However, the items left there might belong to the neighbors. Throwing away someone else's property could be an issue. But there's the context of prior communication: the author has asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave items in their yard. The neighbors' kids are ignoring these requests. The author tried returning items but now just throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away. \n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on another person's land, the landowner isn't obligated to keep it. However, sometimes there's an expectation that if you find someone else's lost item, you might return it or store it. But in this case, the author is not returning them after multiple instances. The neighbor's kids are actively leaving items, not just losing them. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable given the prior communication and the ongoing issue. However, the neighbor dad's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author's action of discarding items might still be seen as wrong because they belong to others. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author protecting their own space. They've made it clear they don't want the kids there. If the items are left in the yard despite warnings, and the author is trying to enforce their boundaries, that could be justified. However, legally, throwing away someone's belongings without their consent could be a problem. Maybe the better approach would be to keep the items temporarily and attempt to return them, but since the author tried that and the neighbors didn't pick them up, maybe the author is justified in discarding them after a reasonable time. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the yard, prior communication, the nature of the items (deliberately left vs. lost), and the neighbor's reaction. The author's actions might be seen as enforcing their property rights, especially given the neighbors' disregard for previous requests. However, there's a balance between protecting one's property and respecting others' belongings. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are considered reasonable in the context. Since the author has tried returning items and the neighbors didn't claim them, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
