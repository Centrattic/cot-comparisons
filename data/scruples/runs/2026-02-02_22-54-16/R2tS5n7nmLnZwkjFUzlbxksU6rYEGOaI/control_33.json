Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about neighbors whose kids leave toys in their yard, and the author throws them away. The neighbors are not on good terms, there was past bullying, and the author has tried to set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. But when it comes to others' belongings left there, there might be legal and ethical considerations. Legally, if someone else's property is on your land, you might not have the right to dispose of it without trying to return it first. The author did try to return items by putting them back in the yard, but now they just throw them away. \n\nThe author mentioned they asked the neighbors multiple times not to leave items in their yard. The neighbors, however, keep allowing their kids to use the yard for games, leading to items being left behind. The key point is whether the author is justified in throwing away items after repeated requests. \n\nEthically, there's a balance between respecting property and maintaining good neighbor relations. The author has a valid concern about safety and boundaries, especially given past issues like the dog incident. However, throwing away items without trying to contact the owners might come off as confrontational, even if the author feels justified. \n\nIn terms of conflict, the neighbor almost came to blows over the glove. That suggests the tension is high. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping because they're taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels, like contacting the neighbors first or perhaps involving a mediator. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has made their stance clear, and the neighbors haven't respected that. The author's kids don't trespass, so there's a double standard. The author might feel that since the neighbors aren't respecting their requests, the only way to enforce the boundary is to remove the items. \n\nLegally, even if the author owns the property, they don't own the items left there. The correct action would usually be to try to return the items or notify the owner. Throwing them away without attempting to contact the owner could be seen as legally problematic. However, in practice, if the owner can't be found, it's a gray area. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong from a property standpoint, but ethically, they might be overstepping by disposing of items without trying to return them properly. The answer could lean towards the author being in the right because they were respecting their own property and tried to communicate, but the act of throwing away might be on the edge. Alternatively, since they did try to return some items before throwing them away, maybe they are justified. But the conflict with the neighbor suggests that even if technically not wrong, the approach is causing more issues. \n\nHmm. The answer probably hinges on whether the author had a duty to make a reasonable effort to return the items. If they just left them out and the neighbors never collected, then throwing them away might be acceptable. But if the items can be returned directly to the owner (like contacting the neighbor), then throwing them away without that step might be wrong. The author did try to return them by placing them back in the yard, but maybe that's not sufficient. \n\nSo, in the end, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were protecting their property and had communicated their boundaries. However, there's an argument that they should have taken more steps to return the items, making them in the wrong. But given the context of the neighbors not respecting their space and past issues, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable.\n"
