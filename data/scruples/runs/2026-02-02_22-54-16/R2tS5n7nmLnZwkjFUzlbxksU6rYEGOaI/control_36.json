Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbors' kids are using the author's yard for their games and leaving stuff behind. The author has tried to make it clear that they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep doing it. The author initially left the items but then started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad got angry about the glove being thrown away.\n\nFirst, property rights: The author owns their yard. If someone leaves items on their property, the owner has the right to dispose of them if the items are considered abandoned. But the question is whether the items are actually abandoned. If the kids left them there by accident and didn't intend to abandon them, then maybe the author is wrong to throw them away. But if the items are left there repeatedly and not claimed, maybe it's reasonable to consider them as abandoned.\n\nThe author has communicated their boundaries, asking the neighbors' kids not to use the yard or leave items. The neighbors didn't respect that, so maybe the author is justified in taking action. However, throwing items away without checking if they're truly abandoned could lead to conflict. Throwing them back into the neighbor's yard might have been a better approach, but the author found that ineffective since the items stayed there indefinitely.\n\nAlso, the fact that there's a history of bullying and tension complicates things. The author's actions might be a reaction to the ongoing issues with the neighbors. But even with that, the legal and ethical standards usually require giving people a chance to claim lost items before disposing of them. The author might have a right to their property but could be expected to make a reasonable effort to return lost items, like placing them in a visible spot and informing the neighbors, rather than just throwing them away immediately.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong ethically because they didn't try to return the items properly after the initial attempts failed. Throwing them away without trying to locate the owners could be seen as taking it too far, even if the neighbors are difficult. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
