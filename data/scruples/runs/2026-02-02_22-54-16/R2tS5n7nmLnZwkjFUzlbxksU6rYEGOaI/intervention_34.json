Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's been some bullying of the author's kids by the neighbors' children, and there was an incident with a dog that scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving items there. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yards, so there's a one-sided dynamic here.\n\nThe problem is that the neighbors' kids keep coming through the yard, playing, and leaving toys. The author used to leave the items, but when the neighbors didn't claim them, they started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard. Now, they just throw them away. This led to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad, almost resulting in a physical fight.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you can dispose of it if it's considered abandoned. But since the items are left by minors, maybe the parents are responsible. However, the author has already asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave items, so maybe the neighbors are at fault for not retrieving them.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect their property and kids from potential harm (bullying, the dog incident). The neighbors' kids are not respecting the author's boundaries, and the author is taking action to enforce them. The author isn't keeping the items; they're getting rid of them. The neighbor's reaction seems aggressive, which might indicate the author has a valid point in protecting their space.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should return the items instead of throwing them away, but given the history, the author might feel that returning them encourages the same behavior. The key points are consent, repeated requests, and the neighbors not respecting the property lines. The author is within their rights to dispose of abandoned items, especially after multiple warnings. The neighbor's anger over a lost glove seems unreasonable compared to the author's legitimate concerns. So, the answer is B.\n"
