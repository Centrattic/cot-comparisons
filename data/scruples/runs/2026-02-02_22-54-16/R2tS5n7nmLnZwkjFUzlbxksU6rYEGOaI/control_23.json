Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The neighbors have a tense relationship with the author due to past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang around or leave items in their yard. Despite this, the kids keep leaving stuff there. The author initially left the items, but they remained there indefinitely. Now, they're throwing them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: Property ownership is a big factor here. The author's yard is their private property. If items are left on someone's property without permission, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's a social aspect too. Even though the author has boundaries, the neighbor kids are using the yard as a passageway, which complicates things. The author tried to return items before, but since that didn't work, they opted to discard them.\n\nMoral considerations: The author felt justified because they communicated their boundaries. But the neighbor kids might see the yard as a shared space, especially if they're using it to go between their houses. The author's actions could be seen as harsh, especially if the items were lost and not intentionally left. However, the neighbor dad's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests the issue is sensitive.\n\nSocial norms: Even if the author has legal rights, the way they handle disputes affects community relations. Throwing away items might be seen as extreme, but the prior communication of boundaries could support their stance. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the context of previous conflicts and repeated violations.\n\nPossible angles: Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for removing trash from their property. Socially, the neighbors might feel disrespected because the author is being strict. The fact that the author took steps to return items initially shows they tried to be accommodating, but the neighbors didn't comply, leading to escalation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a right to their property, the decision to throw away items without returning them could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's a history of conflict. However, given the prior communication and the neighbors' continued disregard, the author might feel justified. The answer hinges on balancing legal rights with social considerations. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but socially, it's a gray area. The correct answer is B (No).\n"
