Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with the kids bullying and a dog incident. The author has clearly communicated that they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving items there. The neighbors' kids still leave things in the yard, so the author starts throwing them away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, legally, property ownership matters. If the items are on the author's property, they might have the right to dispose of them, especially if they're considered abandoned. But sometimes, there are local laws about found items. However, the author has tried other steps first, like returning the items to the yard, but since the neighbors didn't claim them, moving to disposal might be justified.\n\nEmotionally, the author is protecting their space after previous conflicts. They want to avoid further issues. But the neighbors might feel disrespected or that their property is being tossed without notice. The author did mention they tried returning the items first, so they might not be acting out of spite without prior attempts to resolve it.\n\nEthically, while the author has a right to their property, the way they handle it matters. Throwing things away directly after a confrontation could be seen as harsh, but if the items were left unattended and not claimed, it's a bit of a gray area. The fact that they made their boundaries clear from the start is a point in their favor. However, the neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that the disposal caused tension.\n\nIn AITA situations, community usually looks at whether the person made reasonable efforts to resolve the issue. The author did try returning items, then escalated to disposal. The neighbors not respecting the boundary might contribute to the problem. But the act of throwing away personal items could be seen as extreme, even if the author is within their rights.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their boundaries and tried alternatives first. However, the neighbors' perspective isn't fully explained, so there's a balance here. The community might lean towards B (No), as the author had justification for their actions after prior attempts to address the issue.\n"
