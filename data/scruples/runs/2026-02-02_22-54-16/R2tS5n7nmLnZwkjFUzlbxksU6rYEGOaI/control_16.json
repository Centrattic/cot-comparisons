Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has tense relationships with both neighboring families. There's been past issues like bullying and a dog incident involving their autistic son. The author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. The neighbors' kids keep coming through the yard to each other's houses, playing games, and leaving items. The author initially tried returning the items but now just throws them away. This led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone else leaves items there without permission, technically, those items are considered abandoned. In many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land without your consent, you can dispose of it. However, there might be nuances. For example, if the items are still claimed by the owners, they might have a right to retrieve them. But if the items are left unattended for a long time, the owner might be deemed to have abandoned them.\n\nThe author has tried returning the items before, but the problem persists. The neighbors might not be aware that their kids are leaving things, or they might not care. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable because they've given clear warnings and the items are left unclaimed. However, there's a potential for conflict because the neighbor might feel the items are theirs, even if they were left on someone else's property.\n\nAnother angle is the legal perspective. In many places, property owners can remove items left on their land without permission. However, it's possible that the neighbor could claim ownership, leading to a legal dispute. But realistically, if the items are just left there and not retrieved, the owner might not be able to prove ownership after a certain period.\n\nEthically, the author might be justified in protecting their property and setting boundaries, especially after prior issues. However, the confrontational approach (throwing away items instead of returning) might be seen as harsh, but considering the history, it's a way to enforce boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to their property and have communicated their boundaries clearly. The neighbors, on the other hand, are using the yard without permission. The author's actions are a response to ongoing issues and attempts to maintain their property.\n"
