Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the context is that the neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. Despite this, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, so they started throwing them away. Now there's a conflict after a dad confronts them about the glove.\n\nI need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If someone leaves items there, the owner can dispose of them. However, the author did warn the neighbors not to leave things, so there's a history of communication. The problem is that the neighbors' kids are still violating this, leading to the author's actions.\n\nBut maybe the author could have done something else first, like giving the items to the neighbors' homes or local authorities. However, the author tried returning them once but the items stayed unclaimed. Throwing them away is a way to prevent accumulation. The dad's reaction might be understandable if he thinks the author is being too harsh, but the author's stance is about maintaining their property boundaries.\n\nLegally, the author is within their rights. Ethically, it's a bit more gray. The author's actions could be seen as justified if they've given prior warnings and the items are just lying around. However, the confrontation with the neighbor dad complicates things. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), as the author is protecting their property after clear communication.\n"
