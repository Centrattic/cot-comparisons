Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. The situation involves some history of tension between the families, including past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The main question is about the ownership and disposal of items left on someone's property.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Legally, if someone leaves items on your property, you might have the right to dispose of them if they don't claim them. But there are usually time limits before you can do that. However, the situation here isn't just about legal ownership; it's also about the interpersonal conflict. The writer has already asked the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, so maybe they feel justified in taking more drastic measures.\n\nThe writer mentions they used to just throw the items back but now throw them away. The neighbor's reaction was almost coming to blows, which indicates the action escalated tensions. Even if legally allowed, the social norm is to perhaps return lost items or notify the owner. Throwing away without notice could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the existing bad relations. The fact that the writer's kids don't enter the neighbors' yard but the neighbors' kids do enter theirs adds another layer. The writer might see it as a matter of boundaries, but the neighbors might feel disrespected or that their belongings were treated as trash without effort to return them.\n\nAlso, the mention of the autistic son being scared by the dog shows that the writer has valid concerns about their children's safety and well-being. But the way they're handling the toys might be seen as harsh. Maybe a middle ground, like returning the items but not letting the kids use the yard, would be better. However, the writer has already communicated their wishes, and the neighbors are not complying, which could justify their frustration.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the writer is trying to protect their property and children, but their actions might not be the most constructive. The neighbor's anger suggests that the writer's actions are perceived as disrespectful. There's a balance between standing up for one's space and escalating conflict. The answer might hinge on whether the writer's actions are seen as reasonable self-protection or as unnecessarily punitive.\n"
