Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's kids are bullying their kids, and there's some history of conflict, like the neighbor's dog scaring their autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids still come through the yard, play, and leave items. The author initially left the items but after they stayed forever, started throwing them back. Now they just throw them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight because the author threw away a baseball glove.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author's property is their own. If someone leaves items on your property, you're not obligated to keep them. However, there's a social aspect. The author tried to make it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming. The author's actions might be seen as reasonable because they're enforcing their boundaries. But maybe the neighbor dad's reaction is also a factor. Since the author warned them multiple times and the neighbors ignored it, throwing away the items is a way to enforce their wishes. On the other hand, some might argue that returning the items, even with a note, would be better to avoid confrontation. But given the history of conflict, maybe the author is justified in taking a firmer stance. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are within their rights and if they're reasonable considering the circumstances. Since they've communicated their boundaries and the neighbors haven't respected them, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
