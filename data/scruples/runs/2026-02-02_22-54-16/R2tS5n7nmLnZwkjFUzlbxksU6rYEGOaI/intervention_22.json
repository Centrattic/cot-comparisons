Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The writer has made it clear that they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. The writer tried leaving the items there first, but since they weren't claimed, they started throwing them away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The writer's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's there. If someone else's items are left on their property, the owner can decide what to do with them. However, there's also the aspect of being a good neighbor. Even if the neighbors are difficult, the writer's approach might be seen as harsh. Throwing away items, especially after someone has lost them, could be seen as not giving the neighbor a chance to retrieve them. \n\nThe writer did try to return items by putting them back in the yard, but that didn't work. The problem is that the items weren't claimed. But maybe the writer should have tried to contact the parents first, even if they don't get along. Throwing things away immediately might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the items are expensive or have sentimental value. \n\nThere's also the part about the kids not being allowed to go into their yard. The writer enforces that, which is reasonable. The fact that their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yard shows consistency. However, the method of dealing with the items might be the issue. Maybe there's a middle ground, like keeping the items for a set period before disposing of them, or leaving a note. \n\nThe confrontation with the neighbor dad suggests that the disposal of the glove was a point of contention. The writer's justification is that they asked the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, and since the items were left there without permission, they have the right to dispose of them. But the neighbor's reaction indicates that the writer's action was perceived as rude or aggressive. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Well, legally, they have a right to their property. But socially, there's a expectation to handle such matters politely. The writer's actions might be justified in terms of property rights, but the manner in which they handled it could be problematic. The key points are communication and proportionality. The writer did communicate their boundaries, but the response (throwing away items) might be too harsh, especially after a prior attempt to return the items by placing them in the neighbor's yard. \n\nHowever, given that the neighbors ignored previous requests and the items were left indefinitely, the writer might feel they have no other choice. The fact that they tried multiple methods (leaving in the yard, then disposing) shows they gave it a chance. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific community norms. In some places, it's acceptable to dispose of lost items after a reasonable time. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's actions are defensible in terms of property rights, the social aspect might make them seem inconsiderate. But given the context of the neighbors' behavior and the writer's attempts to address it, the answer might lean towards \"not in the wrong.\" But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the writer didn't give the neighbor enough time to claim the items? If the items were left for a long time without retrieval, then it's reasonable. The user says \"they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them,\" which implies a long time. So, in that case, the writer's action is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
