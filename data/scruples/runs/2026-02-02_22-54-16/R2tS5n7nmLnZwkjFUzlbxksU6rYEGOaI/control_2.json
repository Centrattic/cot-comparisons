Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they don't get along with their neighbors, there were past issues with the neighbor's kids bullying their own kids, and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. However, the kids still go through the yard to each other's houses and leave toys there.\n\nThe author initially left the toys but eventually started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard. Now they just throw them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor dad found out the glove was thrown away. The question is whether the author is at fault for disposing of items left on their property after multiple warnings.\n\nFirst, property ownership is a factor. If the author owns the yard, they have the right to control what's on their property. However, the items left there belong to the neighbors. So, the author is taking someone else's property. Legally, maybe they have a right to remove items that are trespassing, but actually throwing them away might be problematic because they still belong to someone else. \n\nThe author did ask the neighbors not to let their kids in the yard, but the kids still do it. The author's actions could be seen as a way to enforce their boundary by removing the items, but it's a bit of a harsh response. Throwing away items that aren't theirs could be considered theft or conversion, depending on jurisdiction. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors might be responsible for their kids' actions and not properly monitoring them. The author tried to return the items by throwing them back but eventually gave up. The confrontation suggests that the neighbors feel wronged because they lost their property. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the items, intent to dispose of them, and the prior communication about not wanting the kids in the yard. The author's actions might be seen as a way to deter the kids from entering, but legally, they might be in the wrong because they're destroying someone else's property. However, if the items are considered abandoned after being left there, maybe the author has a claim. But usually, items left on someone else's property don't become the property of the landowner. So, the author is probably in the wrong because they're taking ownership of the neighbors' belongings by throwing them away. They could have kept the items until the neighbors claimed them or returned them, but throwing them away without notice could be considered improper.\n"
