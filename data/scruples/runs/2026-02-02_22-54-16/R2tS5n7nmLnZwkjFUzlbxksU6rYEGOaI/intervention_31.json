Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbors' kids. The backstory mentions that the neighbors have a tense relationship, with issues like bullying and a dog incident. The user made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave items. The user tried leaving the items but they stayed there forever, so they started moving them back, and now just throw them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, property rights. Legally, if something is on your property, you can decide what to do with it. Even if it's someone else's property, if it's left unattended on your land, you might have the right to dispose of it, especially after giving notice. The user did warn them multiple times not to leave things in their yard, which is important. They also tried returning the items initially, which shows they made an effort to return the items, so there's a good faith attempt to return the items. \n\nBut then they escalated to throwing them away. The question is whether this is reasonable. The neighbor's kids were repeatedly leaving items despite the warnings. The user might feel that since the items were left in their yard, which they consider off-limits, they have the right to remove them. However, throwing them away might be seen as excessive if the items were left accidentally and the neighbors didn't know. But given the context of the strained relationship and prior incidents, the user's actions might be justified as self-preservation. \n\nAnother angle: the user's kids don't enter the neighbors' yards, so there's a consistent boundary. The neighbors' kids ignore the boundary, leading to the accumulation of items. The user's response is a direct reaction to the violation of their space. The neighbor dad's aggressive reaction when the glove was thrown away suggests that he might feel entitled to have his kids use the yard despite the user's warnings, which could indicate his fault. \n\nLegally, the user owns their property, so they can remove items from it. Ethically, it's a gray area. If the items were left unintentionally, throwing them away could be harsh, but given the history of conflict and lack of communication, the user might be protecting their own space. The key points are the prior warnings and the repeated violations. The user's actions are a form of self-enforcement of their property boundaries. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
