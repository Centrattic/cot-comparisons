Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There were past issues with their kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident involving the author's autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. Despite that, the neighbors' kids keep entering the yard and leaving items like baseball gloves, balls, etc.\n\nThe author used to leave the items but found they stayed there forever. Then they tried moving them back to the neighbors' yard, but now they just throw them away. A conflict escalated when the neighbor dad almost came to blows because his kid's glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control who is on their property. They've communicated their boundaries. The neighbors' kids are trespassing and leaving items, which are then discarded. The author isn't keeping the items for personal use but getting rid of them, which might be seen as a way to enforce boundaries. However, throwing away someone else's property without trying to return it could be problematic.\n\nIn many places, when someone leaves property on your land, you have a duty to return it if possible. The author tried returning items by moving them back, but now just throws them away. If the items are left on their property, technically they still belong to the neighbors. The author could be seen as disposing of another person's property, which might be illegal or morally wrong. However, given the ongoing issues and the failure of communication, the author might feel justified in protecting their space.\n\nThe answer depends on balancing property rights with responsibility towards others' belongings. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable for maintaining their space, but legally or morally, they might be in the wrong by not returning the items. The tension here is between personal boundaries and respecting others' property. The fact that there's a history of conflict might sway some to side with the author, but others might argue that they should still return the items through proper channels instead of discarding them.\n"
