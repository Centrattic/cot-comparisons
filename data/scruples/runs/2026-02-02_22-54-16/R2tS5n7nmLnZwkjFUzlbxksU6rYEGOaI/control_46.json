Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The user has neighbors they don't get along with. There were past issues with the neighbor kids bullying their kids and a dog incident involving their autistic son. The user made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard or leaving things there. The kids still come through the yard, play, and leave items. The user used to leave the items but now throws them away. One incident led to almost a fight when the neighbor dad found out a glove was thrown away.\n\nNow, the key points. The user owns their property and has the right to control access. They've communicated their boundaries, but the neighbors aren't respecting them. The user is removing items from their property, which is their legal right. However, throwing them away might be seen as extreme, especially if the items were left there by accident or not intentionally. The neighbor's reaction suggests that the items had value or emotional significance, so the user's action might have been insensitive. But since the user set boundaries and the neighbors kept ignoring them, maybe the user is justified. It's a balance between property rights and community relations. Legally, the user is in the right to remove items from their property. But socially, maybe there's room for improvement. The answer likely depends on whether the user's action is proportionate. Since they've already tried returning items but that didn't work, throwing away could be seen as reasonable. So, answer B.\n"
