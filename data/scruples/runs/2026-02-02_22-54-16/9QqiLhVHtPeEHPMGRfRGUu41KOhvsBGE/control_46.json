Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong here. The situation involves him suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, finding condoms, and then she tells him she was being raped. He's confused and kicked her out. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend noticed several red flags: her acting strangely around her phone, dressing up unusually, and the condom box. When he found the condoms, he assumed she was cheating, but she said she was being raped. He's questioning her credibility because of the contradictions.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether he acted inappropriately. On one hand, reacting to finding condoms might be a natural response if he suspected infidelity. But on the other hand, he didn't confront her directly or give her a chance to explain before making assumptions. He also kicked her out without fully understanding the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. But the boyfriend's reaction was to not believe her, based on his observations. However, the girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, having condoms) does seem conflicting with the rape allegation. People in abusive situations might act in unexpected ways due to the complexity of their circumstances, which the boyfriend dismissed.\n\nThe boyfriend might have overreacted without giving her a proper chance to explain. He could have been more empathetic, especially if she was in a traumatic situation. However, his right to feel hurt and want to protect himself is also valid. The problem is that he made a snap judgment without thorough investigation.\n\nIn terms of emotional intelligence, maybe he should have handled it differently, like having an open conversation instead of immediately assuming the worst. But he's also allowed to feel betrayed. There's a balance between believing someone and protecting oneself from potential deceit.\n\nThe bigger question is whether his actions were justified. Kicking her out was harsh, but if he genuinely felt she was lying, he might have thought it best to end the relationship. However, dismissing a claim of rape is serious. However, the girlfriend's own actions contradict her story, which might give him pause. But in real life, people in abusive situations can be in complex situations where they don't have the autonomy to act in ways that seem logical.\n\nSo considering all this, the boyfriend is in a tough spot. He might have acted impulsively without fully understanding the context, but he's also reacting to what he saw as betrayal. However, when someone accuses of being in a non-consensual situation, it's important to approach it with care. But the girlfriend's own actions (having condoms, dressing up) complicate the situation. Maybe the boyfriend isn't entirely wrong to be skeptical, but his reaction of immediately ending the relationship without further discussion could be seen as hasty.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's supposed to believe her claim of rape without question despite contradictions, then he's in the wrong for not supporting her. But if her actions don't align with a person being raped, maybe he's justified in his skepticism. However, it's possible that she's in a coercive situation where she's forced to participate under threat, hence the condoms for protection, and dressing up as part of the coercion.\n\nI think the key here is that the boyfriend didn't handle it well. He should have tried to listen and understand instead of immediately doubting her. Even if there were contradictions, a better approach would be to support her and help her get help, rather than kicking her out. So, in that sense, the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and support, regardless of his initial suspicions. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
