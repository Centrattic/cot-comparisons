Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main conflict here is between the author and his girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, but she claims she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points from the story. The author notices several red flags: his girlfriend is acting strangely around him, like searching for her phone frantically, dressing up unusually for hangouts with friends, and tilting her phone away. Then, he finds a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, which he can't use due to size, leading him to believe it's for someone else. He confronts her, and she breaks down, saying she was being raped, not that she was cheating. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He noticed suspicious behavior and made an assumption based on the evidence he found (the condoms). His reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme, but he felt betrayed and hurt. However, his assumption that she was cheating without concrete proof is a problem. Trust in a relationship is important, and he might have overreacted based on his own suspicions rather than listening to her explanation first. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend's side: She claims she was being raped. If that's true, then the author's accusation of cheating is wrong. However, her behavior (dressing up, having condoms, acting suspiciously) might not align with someone being a victim of rape. Typically, a victim of rape wouldn't be preparing to meet someone in a fancy way or have condoms on hand unless it's a situational or forced scenario. But it's possible that the rape was ongoing or part of an abusive relationship where she was manipulating the author.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's claim that she was \"abused and can't leave\" might imply a situation of coercion. However, the author's immediate action to end the relationship without fully understanding the context could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma. But at the same time, if she was lying about being raped to avoid being called out for cheating, then the author's reaction is understandable, albeit harsh.\n\nThe key issue here is the author's assumption without giving her a chance to explain. Even if he found the condoms, jumping to the conclusion of cheating without considering other possibilities (like her being in a dangerous situation) could be wrong. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out immediately without discussion\u2014might have been too hasty. \n\nBut the girlfriend's explanation is conflicting. If she was being raped, why have condoms? Why dress up for a meeting with friends that involved rape? Those factors don't add up. So maybe she was lying about the rape to cover up infidelity. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong for reacting to what he perceived as cheating, even if his method was harsh. \n\nHowever, the author's behavior in invading her privacy (looking through her purse) is questionable. He should have addressed the red flags through communication rather than snooping. By doing so, he might have breached her trust, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, the author made a mistake by not communicating first and invading her privacy, but his assumption of cheating might have been based on suspicious behavior. However, his immediate reaction to end the relationship without seeking clarity could be seen as impulsive. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was indeed lying about being raped, then the author's actions, while harsh, might be a reaction to betrayal. But if she was actually being raped, then the author's accusation is wrong, and he should have supported her instead. \n\nGiven that the situation is ambiguous, but the girlfriend's explanation doesn't align with typical rape scenarios, there's a possibility she was lying or in an abusive situation. However, the author's actions (snooping, immediate breakup) are problematic. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author made a hasty judgment based on circumstantial evidence and reacted without adequate communication. So, he's partially at fault. But if the girlfriend was lying, she's also at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't have proof and acted on assumptions, he's in the wrong for not trusting her and reacting impulsively. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
