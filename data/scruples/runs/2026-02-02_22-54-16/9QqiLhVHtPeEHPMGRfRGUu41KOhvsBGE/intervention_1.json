Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in their girlfriend's purse, which they thought were for her to use with someone else, leading them to accuse her of cheating. However, the girlfriend said she was being raped, which the author didn't believe. The author then kicked her out, and now they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: the girlfriend was acting secretive, dressing up unusually, and hiding her phone. Then finding the condoms, which were Magnum size, not his, made him think she was cheating. His reaction was to confront her and then break up, which seems harsh, but he felt wronged. \n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she claims she was being raped. If that's true, then the author's assumption of cheating would be incorrect. However, the girlfriend's behavior could also be explained by other things. For example, maybe she's in a situation where she can't refuse, hence the need for condoms to prevent pregnancy, or she's trying to make herself look nice under duress. But the author didn't consider these possibilities and instead dismissed her explanation as a possible excuse for cheating. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. If the girlfriend was actually being coerced, then the author's disbelief could be harmful. However, the author had reasons to suspect cheating, given the red flags. The problem is that he didn't give her a chance to explain further, just assumed the worst and kicked her out. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author should have tried to understand her explanation before making such a drastic decision. Even if he was hurt, reacting impulsively without seeking clarity might not be fair. On the other hand, if she was actually being raped, his response was dismissive and could have endangered her. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he acted on his suspicions without verifying the truth, especially when she provided a serious explanation (rape), that's a problem. Believing a partner's claim of being raped is crucial. However, if the girlfriend's behavior was inconsistent with being a victim (like dressing up and having condoms), maybe the author had some valid doubts. \n\nBut in reality, the author's immediate reaction was to dismiss her claim and break up, which is a harsh response. Even if he suspected cheating, the girlfriend's accusation of being raped should have elicited support rather than immediate rejection. The author didn't handle it well, not because he had evidence of cheating, but because he didn't seek to understand and support her, which is necessary in such a sensitive situation. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't handle the situation with the care it required, especially given the serious nature of the accusation. However, the girlfriend might have also not been truthful. But the question is about the author's actions. Since he dismissed her explanation and reacted harshly without seeking more info, that's on him. So, A.\n"
