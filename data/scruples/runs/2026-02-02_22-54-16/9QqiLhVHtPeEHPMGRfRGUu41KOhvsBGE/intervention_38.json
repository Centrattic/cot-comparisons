Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend having red flags, finding a box of condoms in her purse, and then she claims she was being raped. The author is conflicted because the situation doesn't add up\u2014like why she's dressed up and has condoms if it's non-consensual.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend's behavior changed: she was acting suspicious, spending more time on her phone, dressing up. Then the author finds the condoms, which he knows he can't use because it's Magnum brand. She then says she's being raped, which seems contradictory to the other behaviors. The author kicks her out because he doesn't believe her explanation.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, if the girlfriend was actually being raped, that's a serious issue. But the author is questioning her story because the facts don't align. The key here is whether the author is at fault for not believing her. However, there's a difference between not believing a claim due to inconsistency and being in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (dressing up, having condoms) don't support the rape claim. If she was truly being raped, she wouldn't be preparing for it with fancy clothes and condoms. That seems like a contradiction, so the author's doubt might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have a different explanation that the author hasn't considered. But given the information provided, the author made a decision based on the inconsistencies. The question is whether he was wrong to act on that. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to see if that holds.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's initial reaction was to cry and say the author didn't care. The author was upset and felt lied to, which is a valid emotional response. He kicked her out, which is a strong action, but given the confusion and possible lies, maybe it's understandable. However, if she was genuinely in danger, the author might have a responsibility to support her. But if her story is fabricated, then the author is protecting himself.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author acted on his instincts when things didn't add up. If the girlfriend was lying about being raped, then the author's reaction is justified. But if she was telling the truth, then the author is at fault. However, based on the provided information, there's no evidence that the girlfriend was telling the truth. The author's actions were in response to what he perceived as lies and inconsistencies.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he acted on his judgment when faced with conflicting information. The key point is that the girlfriend's behavior didn't align with her claim, leading the author to question her story.\n"
