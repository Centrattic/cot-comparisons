Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, which leads to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The author then dumps her, feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author lists several red flags: her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up which is not like her, tilting the phone away, and finding condoms in her bag. When confronted, she says she's being raped. The author is confused because the scenario doesn't fit typical patterns of non-consensual rape, like the fact that she's getting dressed up and has condoms, which implies some level of willingness. He breaks up with her, and she claims he's not supportive.\n\nNow, should the author be in the wrong? Well, let's consider. The author's actions are based on suspicion and finding evidence (condoms) that he interprets as cheating. However, when confronted, she provides a serious claim of being raped. The author's reaction was to kick her out without fully listening or trying to understand her situation. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, people who are being abused might not act in ways that others expect. They might stay in the situation for various reasons: fear, financial dependence, emotional attachment, or trauma. The author's skepticism might stem from not understanding these dynamics. His immediate reaction to break up could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma, even if he had valid concerns about her behavior.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author did confront her in a way that might have been invasive (going through her purse) and then reacted emotionally. His distrust could have been handled better. However, if the girlfriend's story is a lie, then the author's actions were justified. The problem is that without knowing the full truth, it's hard to say. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the given information.\n\nThe key point here is the author's reaction to her rape claim. If someone claims to be a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to believe them and support them, not to question their story based on your own assumptions. The author's immediate dismissal and breakup might be considered harmful, especially if her story is true. However, if she fabricated the rape story to cover up cheating, then the author's actions are justified. But since the user is asking for an ethical assessment, we have to consider the principles of belief in victims versus the other's perspective.\n\nIn many societies, there's a growing emphasis on believing victims of sexual assault, as many survivors face disbelief and retaliation. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her experience, regardless of the truth. Even if he suspected cheating, his response was to immediately reject her without seeking to understand her situation, which might be inconsiderate and harmful. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for not supporting her and making assumptions without considering the complexities of her situation.\n"
