Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was talking to this guy Rick. The author notices some red flags\u2014like her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up a lot more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he finds condoms in her purse, which leads him to think she's cheating. But when he confronts her, she says she's being raped. The author is confused because if she's being raped, why would she have condoms, dress up, and act in a way that seems consensual? He kicks her out, and she's upset, saying he didn't care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He found the condoms and assumed cheating, but when confronted, he didn't believe her claim of rape. The key issue here is the credibility of her statement. If she was indeed being raped, that's a serious situation. However, the author is skeptical because of the context around the condoms and her behavior. \n\nBut wait, in cases of sexual assault, especially if the perpetrator is someone the victim knows, the situation might not fit the stereotype. Sometimes victims might not act in ways that align with expectations. For example, they might dress a certain way because that's what the perpetrator wants, or the presence of condoms could be a red herring. However, the author's skepticism is based on the inconsistency between her story and the evidence he observed. \n\nThe problem is that the author reacted by kicking her out without fully understanding the situation. But if his GF was indeed being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive or not taking her seriously. On the other hand, if she lied about being raped to cover up cheating, then the author is justified in ending the relationship. \n\nThe tricky part is determining who is telling the truth. The author has no evidence of rape, only the statement from his GF. However, he does have evidence of suspicious behavior. In real-life situations, it's possible that someone in an abusive or coercive relationship might not act in ways that others expect. For example, they might comply in certain ways due to fear or manipulation. \n\nBut the author's immediate assumption was cheating, and when confronted, he didn't believe the rape claim. That's a problem because if the GF was indeed a victim, he didn't support her. However, the situation is complex. The author's actions might be seen as not taking her seriously if she was truthful. But if she lied, then the author is justified in ending the relationship. \n\nIt's also important to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Believing someone who says they're being raped is crucial, but the author's confusion stems from the conflicting evidence. The key is whether he had a duty to believe her without proof. In many cases, it's advised to take such reports seriously, but the author's personal observation of her behavior and the condoms led him to doubt her. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he acted on his observations and the inconsistency in her story. However, dismissing the possibility of rape without further investigation could be problematic. But since the question is about whether he is in the wrong, considering the information he had at the time, his reaction might be seen as a decision based on his observations, even if it's a flawed one. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a tough call. However, if the GF was truthful, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive, but the story doesn't provide evidence to confirm her claim. So based on the information given, the answer is B.\n"
