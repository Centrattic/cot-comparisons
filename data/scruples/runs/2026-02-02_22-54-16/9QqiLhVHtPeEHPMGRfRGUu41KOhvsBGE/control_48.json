Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend, her behavior changes, finding condoms, and her claiming she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: girlfriend acting distracted, dressing up unusually, hiding her phone, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions: they went through her purse without asking, found the condoms, and reacted strongly. Then, when the girlfriend tried to explain, he didn't believe her and kicked her out. The girlfriend claims she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. But the author is questioning the credibility because of the context\u2014dressing up, having condoms, and her behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, trusting someone when they say they're being raped is important. However, the author might have had reasons to be suspicious due to the behaviors. But dismissing her claim outright without any investigation might be the problem. The girlfriend's explanation about being in an abusive situation where she can't leave\u2014maybe that's possible? If she's being forced, maybe she's dressing up because the abuser wants it, or the condoms could be for protection, but that's confusing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions of going through her purse without permission and then reacting angrily could be seen as invasive and not trusting her. Even if there were red flags, the way he handled it might have been harsh. The girlfriend might have been in a vulnerable position, and he didn't support her but instead cut her off.\n\nBut then again, the author is questioning if the rape claim is a lie. If someone is cheating, they might make up a story. However, accusing someone of lying about being raped is serious. The author might have wrongfully accused her of faking it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether he should have believed her. In real life, if someone says they're being raped, the appropriate response is to support them, not question their credibility. So, by not believing her and cutting her off, he might be in the wrong. Even if he had suspicions, he should have approached it with more empathy and possibly encouraged her to seek help rather than breaking up.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the girlfriend's behavior. If she was acting suspicious, maybe there's a different explanation. However, the author's assumption that she was cheating and not considering her claim seriously could be the issue. The girlfriend might have been in an abusive situation, and his reaction could have made her feel unsupported, which is harmful.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering the importance of believing survivors of assault, the author's dismissal of her claim is problematic. Even if there were red flags, the way he handled it without proper support or investigation makes him at fault. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
