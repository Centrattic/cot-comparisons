Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who claims she was being raped, but the author had several red flags and found a box of condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed his girlfriend acting suspiciously\u2014like looking for her phone frantically, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which he recognized as Magnum, implying they weren't for him. When confronted, she said she was being raped, but the author found her explanation inconsistent because she was dressed up and had condoms. He kicked her out, and she claims he didn't care.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nOn one hand, the author was concerned and noticed multiple warning signs. Finding the condoms would naturally raise red flags. If she was indeed being raped, having condoms might be part of a situation where she's being forced but uses protection. However, the act of dressing up and the other behaviors could be coincidences or part of a different context. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which might be seen as harsh if she's telling the truth about being a victim. \n\nBut on the other hand, if she was lying about being raped to cover up infidelity, the author is justified in ending the relationship. However, accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter. The author's initial reaction was anger and not giving her a chance to explain further, which might be a problem if she was genuinely in distress.\n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing her claim. If she was actually being raped, the author's response could be seen as dismissive and harmful. But if she was lying, then the author is justified. The problem is that the author made a judgment based on circumstantial evidence without fully understanding her side. \n\nIn such cases, the appropriate response would be to support the victim and encourage her to seek help, rather than immediately breaking up. Even if there are suspicious signs, trust is a big part of relationships. The author didn't handle the situation well by not seeking more information and instead making assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not giving her the benefit of the doubt and for reacting impulsively without considering the possibility that she was in a real crisis.\n"
