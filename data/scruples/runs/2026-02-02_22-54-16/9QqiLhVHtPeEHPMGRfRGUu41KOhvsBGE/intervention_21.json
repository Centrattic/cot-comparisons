Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms in her purse, noticed suspicious behavior like avoiding his phone, and other red flags. Then, when confronted, she says she's being raped. The author breaks up with her, thinking she's lying.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's actions: he found a box of condoms that he couldn't fit, which led him to believe she was cheating. He mentions red flags like her acting distracted when she was on her phone, getting dressed up unusually, and tilting her phone away. When he confronts her, she says she's being raped, and he reacts by kicking her out. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a position where he suspects infidelity but then the girlfriend claims it's non-consensual. The author's reaction might be seen as harsh\u2014immediately breaking up without seeking more evidence or considering her side. But on the other hand, the girlfriend's story doesn't add up: if she's being raped, why have the condoms and dress up? That seems contradictory. However, in cases of non-consensual acts, survivors might not act in ways that align with stereotypes. Maybe the \"dressing up\" was coerced, or the condoms were for protection against STIs in an abusive situation. The author didn't give her a chance to explain further, which could be an issue.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess. The author's assumption that she's lying might be based on incomplete information. He didn't verify her claims, perhaps jumped to conclusions. However, the red flags were there, and his discovery of condoms led him to a logical but harsh conclusion. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014crying and saying he doesn't care\u2014might indicate she felt misunderstood, but her initial claim of rape without providing a solid explanation could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author acted without giving her a chance to explain properly, he might be in the wrong. However, if she was indeed lying about being raped to cover up cheating, he's justified. The problem is we don't know the truth. The key here is whether the author's actions\u2014immediately breaking up and not seeking more information\u2014were wrong. In real life, this scenario would require more evidence, but in the context of AITA, the story is presented as the author's perspective, so the community usually looks at whether his actions were reasonable given the information he had.\n\nThe author's immediate reaction might be too quick. He should have maybe listened more before reacting. But given the red flags and the discovery, his suspicion is understandable. However, accusing her of lying about rape is a serious matter. If she was telling the truth, he's wrong to break up. If she's lying, he's justified. Since we don't know, the question is whether his actions were in the wrong. In AITA terms, the community often considers whether the person overreacted. Here, he might be seen as overreacting by not giving her a chance to explain further. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle it with more care. Alternatively, B if he was justified given the red flags. But I think the mistake is in not verifying her claims before breaking up.\n"
