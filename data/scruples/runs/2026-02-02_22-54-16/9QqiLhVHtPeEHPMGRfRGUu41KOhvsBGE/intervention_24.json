Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend who he believes is cheating, but she claims she's being raped.\n\nFirst, the author noticed several red flags: her acting strangely when her phone was involved, dressing up unusually, avoiding looking at her phone, and finding condoms in her purse. When confronted, she says she's being raped, but the author can't reconcile that with her behavior. He kicks her out, and she accuses him of not caring. The author is conflicted about whether he's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author's actions were based on suspicion and evidence he found. However, he didn't give her a chance to explain further, which could be problematic. If she was actually being raped, his immediate reaction might have been harsh and not supportive. On the other hand, the behavior she's exhibiting (like using condoms, dressing up) seems contradictory to her claim of rape, which is a serious accusation. \n\nBut wait, in cases of sexual abuse, victims might not act in ways that are expected. Some people might dress up for a date thinking it's a normal situation, only to be coerced later. Also, the presence of condoms could be misleading; maybe she was trying to protect herself, or it's not the same situation as cheating. The author's assumption that the condoms were for her own use might be incorrect. She could have had them for a partner, or maybe the situation is more complex.\n\nThe author's decision to kick her out without fully understanding the situation could be seen as not supporting her. If she was genuinely in an abusive situation, his reaction might have made things worse. However, his suspicion is based on observed behavior, and he might not have had all the facts. \n\nBut the key point is his belief that she was cheating versus her claim of being raped. The author's question is whether he's wrong for thinking she wasn't actually being raped. From an outsider's perspective, the situation is confusing. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, the author's immediate dismissal of her rape claim, based on his own assumptions, could be problematic. He might not have considered that her actions don't align with typical expectations of a rape scenario. \n\nIn terms of accountability, if the girlfriend was indeed lying about being raped to cover up cheating, then the author's intuition was correct. However, if she was truthful, then the author's reaction was inappropriate. The answer hinges on the truth of her claim, which isn't clear. Since the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer has to be A or B, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nBut in general, reacting to a person who claims to be a victim of rape by not supporting them could be seen as wrong, especially if there's a possibility that the claim is legitimate. The author might have acted out of anger and hurt, but his approach might not have been supportive. However, his suspicion was based on evidence he found. It's a tricky situation. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author might not be in the wrong for questioning the situation, but his immediate reaction could be seen as harsh. However, the main issue is whether he should have believed her claim. Since he asked if he's in the wrong for thinking she wasn't actually being raped, the answer depends on whether his skepticism is justified. Without more information, it's hard to say, but given that rape claims shouldn't be dismissed out of hand, maybe the author is in the wrong for not giving her more credit. But I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
