Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend having a box of condoms, acting suspiciously, and then claiming she was being raped. The author ended the relationship but is now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed several red flags: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up out of character, tilting her phone away, and then found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she said she was being raped, and he reacted by ending the relationship. Now he's conflicted about whether he was right to do so or if he's the asshole (ITA).\n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author's actions: he didn't confront her directly about the suspicious behavior before finding the condoms. Instead, he went through her purse without asking, which is a violation of privacy. That's a big issue. Even if he had suspicions, invading her privacy by searching her belongings isn't acceptable. Then, when he found the condoms, he made assumptions and reacted impulsively without giving her a chance to explain, which might have been unfair.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She claims she was being raped. If that's true, then the author's suspicion of cheating is misplaced. However, her behavior (dressing up, having condoms) might have led him to that conclusion. But if she was indeed in an abusive situation, her actions might be part of the trauma\u2014like being forced into situations she's not comfortable with. The fact that she broke down crying and said \"she didn't cheat\" suggests she might be in a complicated situation. However, without more context, it's hard to say if her claim is genuine.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions were justified. By invading her privacy and then ending the relationship without a proper conversation, he might have acted too hastily. Even if he had reasons to be suspicious, the method of confrontation was flawed. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious; accusing her of cheating without evidence and then cutting her off immediately might be unjust, especially if her situation is real. However, if she was lying about the rape to avoid consequences, then the author's reaction could be seen as a protective measure.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain her side. He jumped to conclusions based on his assumptions. The fact that the condoms were Magnum brand and he couldn't fit them led to his conclusion, but that's a personal assumption without concrete evidence. The girlfriend's claim of being raped needs to be taken seriously, as false accusations are rare, but without more info, it's hard to say. However, the author's approach was to end the relationship and not listen further, which is problematic.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoings: The author violated her privacy by searching her purse. That's a breach of trust. Even if he had suspicions, that's not the right way to handle it. The girlfriend's behavior might be explained by other factors, and her claim of rape is a serious accusation. The author's reaction was to kick her out and cut ties without attempting to understand or verify her story. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author made a mistake in how he handled the situation. He should have communicated better, not invaded her privacy, and perhaps given her a chance to explain before making accusations and ending the relationship. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong. But the girlfriend's part is also questionable if she was being non-consensual but had condoms, which is confusing. However, without more context, it's hard to say if she's lying. But the author's actions are definitely problematic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he violated her privacy and acted without giving her a chance to explain, leading to a hasty and potentially unjust decision.\n"
