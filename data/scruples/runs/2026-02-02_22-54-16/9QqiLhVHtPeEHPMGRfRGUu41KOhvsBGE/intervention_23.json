Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend, who they suspect of cheating. The key points are that the author found condoms in her purse, noticed her being secretive with her phone, and she claimed she was being raped. The author then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions red flags and behavior that made him suspicious. Finding condoms, especially Magnum size, which he can't use, seems like a big red flag. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014freezing and then crying\u2014could be a sign of guilt. But she says she's being raped. \n\nNow, the author is conflicted. He doesn't believe her claim about being raped because of the contradictions: getting dolled up and having condoms. But she says it's like those abused people who can't leave. The author kicked her out, and she's upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a logical standpoint, the author acted on his suspicions and found evidence (the condoms) that made him believe she was cheating. However, her claim of being raped is serious. If she's actually being raped, then he might have misjudged her. But if she's lying, then he's justified.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author's actions (kicking her out) might be harsh, but if he found evidence of infidelity, he's within his rights to end the relationship. However, the problem is that she's making a serious accusation of rape, which is not something to dismiss lightly. But the author is also not in a position to validate her claim without evidence. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is contradictory. If she's being raped, why would she have condoms? That doesn't align. On the other hand, maybe the rape is ongoing and she's trying to protect herself. But that's a stretch. The author's reaction is understandable given the evidence he found, but he might have acted before fully understanding the situation.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's possible that he overreacted without giving her a chance to explain, but he also found what he believed to be evidence of cheating. The girlfriend's story doesn't add up, which supports the author's doubts. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he acted on the evidence he had, even if he might have misjudged her. However, if the rape claim is true, then he's wrong. But without further evidence, it's hard to say. The author isn't in the wrong for breaking up, but the situation is complex.\n"
