Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is the asshole in this situation. The situation involves their girlfriend, who they suspect is cheating, but she claims she's being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: the girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then the author found condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author then broke up with her, and she's upset because she felt she had to reveal something damaging.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to be suspicious? Did he overreact? And was the girlfriend actually being raped or was she cheating? The author's actions led to the breakup. The girlfriend's explanation seems conflicting\u2014how can someone be raped and also have condoms, be dressed up, and then act in a way that seems secretive? But the author didn't give her a chance to explain further, just took it as a lie.\n\nLegally and ethically, accusing someone of lying about rape is a big deal. Rape is a serious crime, and if the girlfriend had a legitimate situation, the author's reaction might have been hurtful and dismissive. However, the author's behavior leading up to the breakup\u2014confronting her by taking the condoms without discussing, then immediately breaking up\u2014might be seen as hasty. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly, which could have been a better approach. \n\nBut the girlfriend's story doesn't add up. If she was being raped, why would she have condoms? Why dress up? It's possible she's lying, but maybe there's another explanation. The author might be jumping to conclusions. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014publicly calling her out, using the condoms as evidence without a discussion\u2014could be seen as invalidating her if she were actually in a real situation.\n\nOn the flip side, if she was lying, then the author's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to betrayal. But the problem is the author didn't fully process the situation. He assumed she was lying when she said she was being raped, which is a serious accusation to dismiss. \n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not believing her and breaking up without giving her a chance to explain? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for lying? The community often looks at these situations to see if the person who broke up is the asshole, especially if they acted without considering the other person's side. However, if the other person is lying about something serious, the person who left might not be the asshole. \n\nBut in this case, the author didn't give her a chance to explain beyond her initial statement. He just took it as a lie. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't listen to her explanation and acted out of anger. Alternatively, if she was indeed lying, he's not the asshole. But we don't know the truth. The key here is that the author's actions\u2014breaking up immediately without a discussion\u2014might be hasty and not considering her perspective. \n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, the subreddit often considers intent and actions. If someone is wronged, they might not be the asshole. But if their reaction is overly harsh without considering the other person's side, they might be. Here, the author didn't give her a chance to explain further, so he might be the asshole for not listening. However, the girlfriend's story is inconsistent, so maybe she's lying. The answer might be that the author is not the asshole because he had reasons to be suspicious, but his handling was poor. But the subreddit often takes a side. \n\nIn many similar cases, if someone accuses their partner of cheating but the partner says it's a different situation (like being raped), the person who accused might be seen as the asshole if they don't believe their partner and break up. However, if the partner's story doesn't make sense, it's a grey area. But since the author didn't give her a chance to explain properly, he might be the asshole for not being open to hearing her side. So, probably answer A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong)? \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Because, while his handling could have been better, the girlfriend's story is inconsistent, and he had reasons to be suspicious. But the subreddit often leans towards the person who acts without considering the other's side. Hmm. Alternatively, if he publicly labeled her as an asshole, maybe. But the question is whether he's the asshole. Given the conflicting info, he might not be. So answer B.\n"
