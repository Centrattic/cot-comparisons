Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given scenario. The story is about a guy who found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she told him she was being raped. He confronted her, kicked her out, and is now questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy noticed some red flags: her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up differently, tilting her phone away, and then finding the condoms. When he confronted her, she said she was being raped. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he have a right to be suspicious? Did she have a valid reason for the red flags? Was he wrong to not believe her claim of being raped?\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the guy had reasons to be concerned. Red flags like strange behavior and the presence of condoms could lead someone to suspect infidelity. On the other hand, if the girl was actually being raped, he should support her, not dismiss her.\n\nBut there are contradictions. If she was being raped, why would she be dressed up fancy, have condoms, and act in a way that seems to be preparing for a consensual encounter? The guy's skepticism is understandable because those actions don't align with a non-consensual situation. Also, the girl's behavior after being confronted (freezing, crying, then breaking down) might indicate she's lying or at least not being truthful.\n\nHowever, the issue here is that the guy didn't give her a chance to explain the situation properly. He immediately assumed the worst and kicked her out without hearing her out. If she was genuinely being raped, he should be supportive. If she lied, then maybe his reaction was justified. But since he didn't get the full story, is he at fault for not believing her?\n\nBut wait, the girl's explanation was that it's a side effect of being abused and she can't leave. That doesn't quite make sense. Why would she have the condoms and dress up if she's being forced? The guy's confusion is valid. The situation is very complex.\n\nThe question is whether the guy was wrong to not believe her. In cases of sexual assault, it's crucial to believe the victim. However, if the evidence doesn't align with a non-consensual situation, maybe the girl is lying. The guy might not be in the wrong for being skeptical given the contradictions, but he could have handled it better by listening first instead of immediately ending the relationship. \n\nBut the problem is that the user's initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the guy's actions were justified. If he had valid reasons to doubt her story, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he dismissed her claims without proper investigation, he might be. But in real life, it's very complicated. The answer might hinge on the balance between taking her claims seriously and his right to question suspicious behavior.\n\nI think the key here is that the guy didn't have enough evidence to conclude she was lying. He acted on his suspicions without fully understanding her situation. While his behavior (kicking her out) was harsh, his doubt might be understandable given the inconsistencies. However, the correct approach would have been to listen to her explanation first before making a judgment. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that he was in a situation where he might not be in a position to judge the validity of her claim (as rape can be complex and not always evident from the victim's actions), there's a possibility he was wrong to not believe her. However, the red flags he noticed could also indicate deceit. This is a tough call.\n\nIn the end, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the situation presented inconsistencies that made his doubt reasonable, but he should have handled it differently. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it. So if the girl was actually being raped, he was wrong. If she was lying, he wasn't. Since we don't have all the facts, but the scenario is presented from his perspective, perhaps the answer is B (No).\n"
