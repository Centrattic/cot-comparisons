Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not believing their girlfriend when she said she was being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: the girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone when the author was present, dressing up more than usual, and there were condoms found in her purse. When confronted, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author was wrong to not believe her. On one hand, the girlfriend made a serious accusation of rape. That's a traumatic experience, and it's important to take such claims seriously. However, the author points out inconsistencies: why would someone getting raped be dressed up and have condoms? Those details make the situation confusing. But the author might be missing context here. Maybe the girlfriend was in a situation where she felt forced, even if she appeared to be dressing up for other reasons. \n\nBut then again, the author's actions\u2014kicking her out without hearing more\u2014could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend did cry and say the author didn't care. The problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. The girlfriend's explanation about it being a side effect of abuse (like being trapped) might be valid, but the author didn't engage with that. \n\nHowever, the author also had valid reasons to feel betrayed. Finding condoms intended for someone else is a big deal. But the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation. The author's reaction might be too harsh if the girlfriend was telling the truth. But if the girlfriend was lying, then the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nThe challenge is balancing belief in someone's trauma versus the suspicious circumstances. In many cases, people who are abused or coerced into situations might not act in ways that seem obvious. However, the presence of condoms and the dressing up could be red flags. The author's immediate reaction\u2014shattering their relationship without further discussion\u2014might be hasty. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, we're taught to believe victims of sexual violence. But the author's skepticism could stem from the inconsistencies they observed. Still, a better approach might have been to support the girlfriend and seek help, rather than breaking up. But if the author felt manipulated or lied to, their actions might make sense. \n\nThe answer is tricky. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the author's reaction is wrong. If she was lying, the author is right to end things. Since we don't have the full truth, but based on the information given, the author's decision to end things based on suspicion without further investigation could be seen as not being in the wrong. However, the way they handled it\u2014without giving her a chance to explain\u2014might be harsh. But considering the context, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. The answer might be B (No), because the author had reasons to doubt, even if it's a sensitive situation.\n"
