Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's claim of being raped. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author noticed several red flags\u2014his girlfriend acting oddly around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and then finding a box of Magnum condoms. When confronted, she says she was being raped. He kicks her out, feeling cheated, but is confused because her behavior doesn't align with his understanding of a rape scenario.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had reasons to be suspicious based on her behavior and the presence of condoms. On the other hand, rape is a serious accusation, and even if the girlfriend's story didn't make sense, he should approach the situation with sensitivity. \n\nBut the key here is that he didn't give her a chance to explain further. The girlfriend could have a legitimate reason that wasn't obvious to him. However, his immediate reaction was to kick her out, which might be harsh. But given the red flags he observed, his skepticism isn't entirely unfounded. However, handling it by confrontation and not seeking a calm discussion could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's explanation about \"being abused and not being able to leave\" is vague. The author's anger and not wanting to hear more might indicate he's not open to her explanation, which is a serious issue. But in terms of being in the wrong, the main point is whether he was justified in his actions. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on the context. If the girlfriend was indeed lying, then the author might be right to be skeptical, but if she was truthful, then his reaction was wrong. Since we don't know the truth, but he had valid reasons to doubt, the answer is complicated. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he didn't have proof and reacted emotionally, it's possible he's in the wrong for not giving her a proper chance to explain. However, the presence of the condoms and her behavior might support his skepticism. \n\nConsidering the situation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had legitimate concerns and found evidence that conflicted with her claim. But I'm a bit torn because he didn't handle it with care. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for thinking she wasn't getting raped. His thought process, based on observed behaviors, isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
