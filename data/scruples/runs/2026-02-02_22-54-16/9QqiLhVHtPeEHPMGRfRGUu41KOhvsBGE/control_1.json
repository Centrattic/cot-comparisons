Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she claimed she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The guy noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms, which he assumed were for him, but realized they were Magnum size, which he can't use. This led him to accuse her of cheating. She responds by saying she's being raped, which he finds hard to believe, especially given the other behaviors like dressing up and having the condoms. He ends the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the guy had reasons to suspect something was off due to her changed behavior. However, his response was to confront her in a way that might have been invasive (checking her purse) and then he didn't really listen to her explanation. She claims she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. Even if he thought she was lying, he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. \n\nBut then, her behavior and the presence of condoms that don't fit him do seem conflicting if she's being raped. However, the fact that she was crying and felt \"damaged\" might indicate some truth to her claim, even if it's not the full story. Maybe she was in an abusive relationship and the condoms were for protection, or maybe she was trying to set up some kind of defense? \n\nBut the problem here is that the guy immediately dismissed her explanation. If someone says they're being raped, even if their actions seem contradictory, the appropriate response might be to support them rather than accuse them of lying. However, the guy's actions\u2014like going through her purse, which is a privacy issue\u2014could be seen as wrong too.\n\nWait, but in the U.S., it's generally illegal to rape someone, so if she was being raped, that's a legal issue. However, the guy's initial assumption that she was cheating and then not believing her when she said she was being raped might be a problem. The red flags he noticed might be explained by other factors, but he jumped to conclusions without fully understanding the context.\n\nAlso, the way he reacted\u2014grabbing the condoms and going to the bathroom, then getting angry\u2014could be seen as not handling a sensitive situation properly. If she was indeed being raped, she might be in distress and need support, not confrontation. However, if she's lying about being raped, that's a serious issue too.\n\nThere's a balance here between respecting her privacy and his right to know if he's being cheated on. But the key point is that he didn't give her a chance to explain her side properly. He just reacted emotionally. Also, the fact that she was in tears and felt \"damaged\" suggests that his response was hurtful regardless of the truth.\n\nBut then again, if she was actually being raped, maybe she was in a situation where she couldn't confront the person or needed to protect herself, but that doesn't explain the fancy dressing. It's a confusing mix of signals.\n\nIn terms of the question of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But generally, when someone claims to be a victim of a serious crime like rape, even if there are red flags, the appropriate response is to support them and help them get help, not to immediately dismiss their claim and end the relationship. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not believing her and not handling it with more empathy. But then again, he had reasons to be suspicious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he had legitimate concerns and the situation didn't add up. If she was lying about being raped to cover up cheating, then his reaction is justified. But how can he know that without more information?\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain. He just reacted based on his assumptions. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not listening and for invading her privacy. Also, the fact that he found the condoms and made an immediate assumption without talking to her first might be his mistake. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with the necessary care and support, especially when his girlfriend made a serious accusation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if his actions were based on his own suspicions and the situation seemed contradictory. But given that the person said she was being raped, which is a serious claim, the author's response of not believing her and ending the relationship without understanding could be seen as wrong.\n"
