Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after confronting his girlfriend about her interactions with Rick and a box of condoms. The girlfriend claims she was being raped. The author is questioning her explanation because of inconsistencies like her being dressed up, using Magnum condoms (which he can't use), and her behavior when he found the box.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he found the condoms in her purse, which he didn't use, leading him to suspect infidelity. He confronted her, and she said she was being raped. The key issue here is whether his disbelief and subsequent actions (kicking her out) were justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, believing a partner when she says she's a victim of rape is crucial. Rape is a serious crime, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. The author's initial reaction was based on suspicion, which might be a red flag. However, his girlfriend's behavior did raise red flags (like acting suspiciously, hiding her phone, getting fancy for outings). The author felt hurt and betrayed, leading him to act impulsively.\n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. Even if there were inconsistencies, the author should have approached the situation with more empathy and sought to understand rather than accuse. His reaction of not believing her and cutting off all contact might be seen as not supporting her, especially if she was indeed in a vulnerable situation.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's explanation that it's like people who can't leave an abusive situation might not be a valid defense. If she was in an abusive situation, why was she using condoms? That seems contradictory unless she's lying. The author's skepticism isn't entirely unfounded, but his response was harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was actually being raped, the author shouldn't have dismissed her. But if she was lying, then the author's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to betrayal. The problem is the lack of clear evidence on either side. The author's actions (not believing her) could be seen as not supporting her if she was truthful, but his suspicions might be valid if she was lying.\n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the community often values empathy and communication. The author's immediate judgment and cutting off the relationship without giving her a chance to explain properly (though he did confront her) might be seen as harsh. However, his suspicion based on her behavior is understandable. The key is whether his disbelief was reasonable. Given the inconsistencies (condom brand, her behavior), maybe his doubt isn't unreasonable, but his response was not supportive.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? If he didn't believe her and she was telling the truth, then he is. If she was lying, then maybe not. But the situation is ambiguous. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the person's actions and how they handled the situation. The author didn't give her a fair chance to explain, and instead of seeking more information, he reacted emotionally. That could make him the asshole. However, if her explanation was clearly not credible, maybe not. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he had reasons to be suspicious, but his handling was poor. However, AITA usually expects more consideration of the other person's claims. This is a tough one. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he had valid reasons to be concerned, but his response was harsh. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because he didn't support his partner's claim of being raped.\n"
