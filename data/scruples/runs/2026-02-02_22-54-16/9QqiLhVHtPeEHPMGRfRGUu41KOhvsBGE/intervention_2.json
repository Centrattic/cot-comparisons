Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who the author suspects of cheating. He found condoms and she claimed she was being raped. The author then kicked her out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: her being secretive with her phone, acting distracted, dressing up unusually, and the presence of condoms. When he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she responded with a claim of being raped. The author's reaction was to end the relationship, feeling betrayed and lied to.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the girlfriend's explanation. The author's trust was broken, and he felt the need to protect himself. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation. If she was indeed being raped, then the author's immediate reaction might be seen as dismissive of her trauma. But if her story is a lie, then the author had a valid reason for his actions.\n\nBut how do we assess the truth here? The girlfriend's behavior and the context (condoms, her reaction) might be consistent with her being a victim. If she was being forced into situations, maybe the condoms are for protection from STIs, and the dressing up could be part of a coercive dynamic. The author's assumption that she was cheating could be a misunderstanding. However, without more information, it's hard to know. \n\nThe author's initial suspicion might be based on jealousy or insecurity, but he did notice changes in her behavior. The problem is that he didn't give her a chance to explain before reacting. When she did explain (albeit possibly incompletely), he was dismissive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are understandable if he felt betrayed, but the girlfriend's claim of rape is a red flag. If she was truly a victim, the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her experience. However, if her claim is a lie to justify cheating, then the author was right to end the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since we don't have all the facts, but the girlfriend's explanation is not fully clear, the author's reaction might be a mix of justified self-protection and possible misjudgment. However, the way he handled it\u2014immediately kicking her out without a full explanation\u2014could be problematic if she was genuinely in a situation of abuse. But if he's right that she was lying, then he's right to leave. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the credibility of her rape claim. Since the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and the girlfriend's explanation is vague, there's a possibility of her lying. But in real-life situations, assuming someone is lying about rape is a serious accusation. The author might have acted impulsively based on incomplete information. \n\nGiven the conflicting possibilities, but leaning on the idea that the author acted on his best judgment with the info he had, maybe the answer is B. However, the author's immediate dismissal of a potential rape situation could be seen as wrong. But again, without knowing the truth, it's hard. The AITA format often leans towards the person who acted on their suspicions if the other party's behavior is questionable. Since the girlfriend's behavior was out of character and the condoms were found in her purse, the author's suspicion might be valid. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his actions were based on observed red flags and his trust being broken, and the girlfriend's explanation is ambiguous at best.\n"
