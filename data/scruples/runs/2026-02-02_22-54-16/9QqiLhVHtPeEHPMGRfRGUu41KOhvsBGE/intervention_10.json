Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the details first.\n\nThe author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, has been acting strangely. She's been searching for her phone frantically, not engaging in conversations, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. Then, the author finds a box of condoms in her purse. The GF then claims she's being raped, but the author is skeptical because of the context\u2014like the fancy dressing and having condoms. The author ends the relationship, and now he's unsure if he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions and the GF's claims. The author is questioning if he's an asshole (AITA) for not believing her rape claim. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nIn the US, there's a legal aspect where false rape accusations are rare but possible, though it's important to handle such cases with care. However, the author isn't reporting to police, just reacting to his suspicions. The GF says she's being raped but doesn't provide evidence. The author's response is to end the relationship, which he has the right to do, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for doubting her claim.\n\nThe GF's behavior is inconsistent with her claim. If she's being raped, why the fancy clothes and condoms? Also, she didn't report it earlier, and this is out of character. However, trusting a partner's claim of being a victim of a crime is complex. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissive, but he's also acting on his observations.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations: The author's immediate reaction is based on his observations and the context. While it's important to believe victims, the situation here is within a personal relationship, not a legal one. The author isn't accusing her of a crime in a public context but is questioning her truthfulness in their relationship. Ending the relationship is a personal choice, and he has the right to set boundaries. However, doubting a rape claim can be sensitive. \n\nBut the GF's story doesn't hold up under scrutiny. The author's suspicion is based on inconsistencies. The GF's reaction (crying, claiming he doesn't care) could indicate guilt or genuine distress. However, the author's actions (finding the condoms, the frozen reaction) might have justified his doubts. \n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing her. In a personal context, the author isn't obligated to believe her without evidence. He's reacting to what he perceives as betrayal. However, the term \"rape\" is a heavy accusation, and the GF's claim could have been a manipulation tactic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reaction is harsh, it's within his right to end the relationship if he suspects deceit. The GF's behavior is inconsistent with her claim, and the author isn't in the wrong for questioning it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
