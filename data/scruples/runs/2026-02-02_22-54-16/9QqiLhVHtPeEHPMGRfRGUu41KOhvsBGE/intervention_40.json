Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting their girlfriend of cheating, finding condoms, and then the girlfriend claiming she was being raped. The author is conflicted because they can't reconcile the girlfriend's actions (dressing up, using specific condoms) with the rape claim. They ended the relationship and are now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they noticed behavioral changes, found condoms, and then the girlfriend's reaction. The girlfriend's side is that she was being raped. But the author is confused because the behavior doesn't align with their understanding of a rape scenario. The key issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified given the information they had at the time.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, they had red flags and acted on them. They didn't accuse her of cheating outright but were suspicious. When confronted, the girlfriend's explanation (being raped) seems contradictory to her actions. The author felt hurt and decided to end the relationship, which might be seen as a self-protective measure.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of the author being quick to judge without fully understanding the context. Rape can happen in various situations, and the victim's actions might not align with the perpetrator's expectations. The girlfriend might have been in a coercive or manipulative situation that makes her behavior confusing from an external perspective. The author might be dismissing her trauma without considering complexities like trauma responses or manipulation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is in a position where trust is a cornerstone of the relationship. If they have serious doubts and the person they trusted is giving conflicting explanations, their decision to end the relationship could be seen as self-preservation. They might not have the tools or knowledge to assess the validity of the rape claim beyond surface-level observations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The answer hinges on whether the author acted unreasonably. The author didn't confront her with accusations but found evidence that led them to a conclusion. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation that should be taken seriously. The author might be dismissing a potential trauma without adequate evidence, which could be seen as problematic if the girlfriend's story is true.\n\nBut in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend was being raped, she might not have felt safe to fully explain. Conversely, if she lied about the rape to cover cheating, the author's actions were justified. The problem is the lack of clear evidence either way. The author made a decision based on their perception, but without more context, it's hard to say who is right. However, the author is not in the wrong for acting on their feelings and the evidence they had, even if it turns out the girlfriend's claim was genuine. They can't be expected to know the full story without more information. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here that they might not have handled the situation with enough empathy. But given the options, the answer is B.\n"
