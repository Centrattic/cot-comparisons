Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in their girlfriend's purse, and she told him she was being raped. He reacted by kicking her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend was acting strangely: looking for her phone frantically, dressing up fancy when she usually doesn't, tilting her phone away. Then there's the condoms. The author found them when looking for Advil, which might have been a trigger. She responded by saying she was being raped, which the author found implausible. \n\nThe key question is whether the author was in the wrong for not believing her. Trust is a big part of relationships. If someone accuses you of cheating, you might feel hurt and defensive. But if someone says they were raped, that's a serious accusation. However, the author is confused because the behavior doesn't align with what he expects from a rape situation. The girlfriend didn't seek help or report it immediately, which might raise questions. \n\nBut is the author justified in doubting her? Well, rape is a trauma, and people's reactions can vary. Some might not seek help right away. However, the presence of condoms in her possession during a supposed rape is a red flag. Condoms are typically used with consent. If she was being forced, why would she have them? That seems contradictory. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be harsh, but he's in a state of shock and anger. But he's questioning his actions. The girlfriend's explanation about \"people who can't leave\" (like in abusive situations) doesn't fully explain the use of condoms. If she was in an abusive relationship where she feels trapped, she might still use protection if she's being coerced, but that's a stretch. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a big assumption. Maybe she had a legitimate reason for the condoms, but the rape accusation was a way to explain away his discovery. Or maybe she was in an abusive situation and didn't know how to ask for help. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt. Rape is a serious issue, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. But if there's a lack of supporting evidence (like no prior signs of abuse, no immediate action to seek help), maybe the author's doubt is justified. \n\nHowever, when someone makes a claim like that, it's important to take it seriously. Even if it's a lie, responding with anger and breaking up might be the wrong approach. The author could have asked for more details or encouraged her to seek help. \n\nSo the author is in a tough spot. On one hand, he found evidence that doesn't align with her story. On the other, making assumptions about her character without confirming the truth could be the real issue. The answer might depend on cultural context and how society views such claims. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for being suspicious, but his reaction was harsh. However, if he had evidence pointing to her lying more directly, he might be in the right. But since the situation is ambiguous, it's possible he was wrong to not believe her without proper investigation.\n"
