Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The situation involves the author finding condoms in his girlfriend's purse after observing some suspicious behaviors. She then says she was getting raped, which leads to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts from both sides. The author had reasons to be suspicious: her phone-searching behavior, fancying up for friends, and the condoms. When confronted, she claims she was being raped. The author finds her explanation conflicting\u2014he's questioning how she could be getting \"dolled up\" and have condoms if it's non-consensual. The girlfriend reacts with shock and claims he's not caring for her.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the accusation of disbelief in a rape claim. Rape is a serious crime, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. However, the author had some red flags that made him suspicious. The problem is that he didn't take her claim seriously and instead reacted with anger and disbelief. \n\nBut wait, the story is from the author's perspective. He says he felt the situation didn't add up, but when she said she was being raped, he still reacted negatively. The key point here is that believing survivors is important, but the author's reaction was to accuse her of lying, which is problematic. The girlfriend's behavior could be explained by other factors (like abuse that she can't leave), but the author didn't consider that she might be in a manipulative situation. However, his immediate reaction was to doubt her, which is a big issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of condoms and the behavior might have given him pause. But even so, how he handled it\u2014immediately not believing her and ending the relationship\u2014could be seen as not supporting her. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his disbelief is justified. Since rape is a serious accusation and the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt, that's problematic. However, the girlfriend's explanation about being abused but not leaving might add context. But the author's reaction was to kick her out and not engage further, which is dismissive.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often emphasizes empathy and support. Dismissing someone's claim of rape, especially without evidence to the contrary, is typically seen as wrong. The author's reaction was to accuse her of lying, which is a big no-no. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the key is that the author didn't support her when she claimed to be a victim. Even if he had suspicions, he should have sought to understand or offer support before making assumptions. Hence, answer A.\n"
