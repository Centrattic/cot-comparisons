Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on this situation. The question is whether the author is at fault for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend, who was in a relationship, was seen talking to another guy, Rick. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: she was frantically looking for her phone, acting distracted, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was getting raped, so he broke up with her, feeling she was lying. Now he's asking if he's the asshole for not believing her.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and evidence. The author didn't have direct proof of cheating but found condoms and her behavior raised red flags. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious allegation. The author's reaction was to question her, but there's a nuance here. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. On the other hand, the author is reacting to what he perceives as contradictions in her behavior and words.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone says they were raped, even if their actions seem conflicting, it's not up to the partner to judge the validity. The author's assumptions might be based on his own understanding, but rape can be complex. Survivors might act in unexpected ways due to trauma. The author's immediate reaction to \"kicking her out\" and not allowing an explanation might have been too harsh without fully understanding her situation.\n\nAlso, the author admits he felt embarrassed and angry, which led to the confrontation. He might have jumped to conclusions without considering other possibilities. The fact that she \"froze\" and then cried when he found the condoms could indicate fear or guilt, but it's not clear. The author's response was to end the relationship without giving her a chance to explain, even though she was crying and trying to explain.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if he didn't have concrete proof of cheating, but only circumstantial evidence and her claim of rape, then his reaction of not believing her could be problematic. It's important to take such allegations seriously and support the survivor, even if the situation seems confusing. The author's immediate judgment and breaking up might be seen as invalidating her experience, which is a serious issue.\n\nSo, the answer here is that the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her rape claim based on his assumptions and didn't support her, even though there's no clear evidence. It's a complex situation, but the key takeaway is that rape accusations should be taken seriously regardless of the circumstances.\n"
