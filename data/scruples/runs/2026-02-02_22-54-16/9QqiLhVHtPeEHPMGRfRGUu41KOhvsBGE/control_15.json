Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse while she was about to go out with friends. He thought she was cheating, but she claimed she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's second-guessing if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of the story. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing fancy out of character, tilting her phone away. Then finding the condoms made him think she was cheating. She responded by saying she was being raped, which he found hard to believe because of the other behaviors\u2014like dressing up and having condoms, which seems odd if someone is being forced.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and the author's reaction. If she was actually being raped, then the presence of condoms might not make sense. However, there's a possibility that she might be in a coercive situation where she's forced into sexual acts, and having condoms could be a precaution, even if she's not comfortable. But the fact that she was getting dressed up and being secretive could indeed conflict with the idea of a forced situation. People in abusive situations often don't have the luxury of choosing their attire or circumstances, so that's a red flag.\n\nThe author's immediate reaction was anger and not believing her. He didn't give her a chance to explain further and kicked her out. His skepticism is understandable given the inconsistencies he noticed, but accusing someone of lying about rape is serious. Rape is a traumatic experience, and the author dismissed her claim without proper evidence. However, the story also shows that he felt lied to and hurt, which is a valid emotion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, it's important to note that if someone is being raped, the perpetrator is the one who is in the wrong, not the survivor. However, the author's situation is about whether he was justified in his reaction. If he had no proof and just assumed she was lying, that could be problematic. On the other hand, if there were signs that conflicted with her story, he might have had some reasonable doubts.\n\nBut the main issue is that he didn't give her the benefit of the doubt. Instead of listening and trying to understand, he reacted with anger and disbelief. Survivors of sexual violence often face disbelief and blame, which is a societal issue. The author's response, while hurtful, might stem from his own confusion and pain, but dismissing her claim without evidence could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn summary, the author's skepticism is based on observed inconsistencies, but his reaction of not giving her a chance to explain fully and immediately assuming she lied is problematic. The correct approach would have been to support her, report the situation to authorities if she made a claim, and seek help. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not believing her and cutting her off without proper consideration.\n"
