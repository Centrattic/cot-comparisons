Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. But when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author kicked her out, but now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend's behavior did change: she was acting suspicious, searching for her phone frantically, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then there's the condoms. The author found them while looking for Advil. The girlfriend's explanation was that she was being raped, but she also mentioned that it could be a side effect similar to abuse victims not being able to leave. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and the author's actions. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, that's a serious criminal issue. But the author's reaction was based on his own assumptions. He didn't take her claim seriously, which could be a problem. However, her behavior and the presence of condoms seem to contradict her statement. People who are in consensual relationships usually don't keep condoms for others, right? Unless they're in an open relationship, which wasn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014kicking her out after finding the condoms\u2014might be seen as harsh, but he was reacting to what he perceived as betrayal. However, if his girlfriend was actually being raped, he should have supported her instead of doubting her. But the problem is, her behavior doesn't align with someone in a non-consensual situation. Rape victims can't just decide to go out dressed up and have condoms for other people; that's more consistent with consensual sex.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have evidence beyond his assumptions. He found the condoms, but that alone doesn't prove cheating. Maybe she was carrying them for friends or for protection. But the girlfriend's immediate reaction\u2014freezing and crying\u2014might indicate guilt or fear. However, if she was truly being raped, she might not have the same reaction.\n\nThe bigger issue is that the author didn't take her claim seriously. If someone says they're being raped, that's a serious allegation. But the context here is conflicting. The author is in a tough spot, but he should have perhaps tried to get more information or support her instead of immediately doubting her. However, given the evidence he found, his doubt isn't entirely unfounded. \n\nSo, considering both sides: if the girlfriend was lying about being raped to cover up cheating, the author was right to be suspicious. If she was actually being raped, then the author should have believed her and supported her. But the problem is the girlfriend's behavior doesn't align with being a victim. Therefore, the author's reaction, while harsh, was based on the evidence he had. But he might have been dismissive of her claim without giving her a proper chance to explain. However, the way she handled it\u2014immediately breaking down and giving a vague explanation\u2014might not be how a true victim would react. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be the asshole because his actions were based on the evidence he found, but he should have handled the situation more carefully. However, given the contradictions in her story, his doubt is somewhat justified. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
