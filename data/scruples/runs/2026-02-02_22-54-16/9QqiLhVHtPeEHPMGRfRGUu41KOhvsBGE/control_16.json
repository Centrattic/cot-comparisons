Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy whose girlfriend is accused of cheating, and he found condoms in her purse. She claims she was being raped. The guy kicks her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy noticed some red flags: her acting strangely when searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, and the condom box. When he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she said she was being raped. He didn't believe her and broke up with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. When someone claims they were raped, it's a serious accusation. The guy immediately dismissed her explanation without giving her a chance to elaborate. Rape is a traumatic experience, and victims often go through a lot of fear and anxiety. The fact that she was dressed up and had condoms might make the situation seem contradictory, but that doesn't necessarily mean her claim is false. People's reactions in such situations can be complex. For example, she might be in a coercive relationship where she's being forced despite appearing to consent, or there could be other dynamics at play that aren't immediately obvious.\n\nHowever, the guy's behavior also has issues. He went through her purse without her consent, which is a violation of trust. Even though he was acting out of suspicion, that action itself is problematic in a relationship. Additionally, instead of listening to her explanation, he immediately assumed she was lying and kicked her out. That's a harsh reaction without gathering more information.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is suspicious. The red flags he noticed could indicate something else, but they're not definitive proof of cheating or rape. It's possible she was in an abusive situation, but her reaction upon being confronted (freezing and crying) could be genuine fear or guilt. The fact that she hadn't done anything like this before, as he mentions, might suggest a sudden change in behavior, but that could be due to new circumstances.\n\nThe key here is that the guy didn't handle the situation with care. He should have approached the situation more sensitively, perhaps by expressing his concerns and seeking to understand her side before jumping to conclusions. Dismissing her claim of rape without any investigation or empathy is a major issue. Rape is a serious crime, and the appropriate response would be to support the victim, not to accuse them of lying. However, the girlfriend's actions also don't align perfectly with her story, which complicates things.\n\nIn most cases, when someone accuses a partner of cheating, the immediate assumption is that the accusation is true. But when the accused claims they were raped, the situation becomes legally and emotionally complex. The guy might feel betrayed, but he's in a position where he needs to consider the seriousness of her claim. If she was indeed a victim of rape, then the real issue is the perpetrator, not her. However, if her story is fabricated, then the guy was right to leave.\n\nThe problem is that we don't have all the facts. The girlfriend's explanation about it being a \"side effect like those people who are abused and can't leave\" might refer to situations where abuse victims can't leave due to fear, threats, or trauma. However, rape is a different scenario. If she was being forced, the presence of condoms and her dressing up is confusing. It's possible she's in an abusive relationship where she's being coerced into situations that appear consensual. Alternatively, she might be lying about the rape to cover up infidelity.\n\nIn terms of the guy's actions, he violated her privacy by going through her purse. That's a breach of trust. Confronting her in the bathroom with the condoms found in her purse could have been done in a more respectful manner. Instead, he reacted with anger and disbelief, which is understandable given the situation but not the healthiest approach.\n\nThe AITA aspect usually looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The guy's actions\u2014going through her belongings, not believing her rape claim, and ending the relationship\u2014might be seen as harsh. If he had a reasonable suspicion and then dismissed her without evidence, he might be in the wrong. However, if he had no reason to believe her story was fabricated, then he's within his right to question it.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy made several mistakes: invading her privacy, not giving her a proper chance to explain, and immediately doubting her rape claim. Rape is a serious accusation, and while it's important to take it seriously, the guy's reaction was based on his immediate suspicion without thorough investigation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more carefully and respecting her autonomy.\n"
