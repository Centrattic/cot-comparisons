Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who the author suspects of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms, noticed her acting suspiciously, and then kicked her out after confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's actions: he found the condoms, got upset, confronted her, and she said she was being raped. He then kicked her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe main factors here are trust and how he handled the situation. He had suspicions based on her behavior, but he didn't confront her calmly first. Instead, he found the condoms, got angry, and reacted impulsively. His reaction of kicking her out and cutting contact might be seen as harsh, especially if she was genuinely in a situation like being forced into something. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's claim of being raped raises serious concerns. If true, his reaction could be dismissive or traumatic for her. However, his suspicion might be valid if she was in an abusive situation where she felt compelled to have sex, hence the condoms. But the way he reacted\u2014without giving her a chance to explain fully\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe user might be considering the balance between trust in a relationship and the right to self-defense or protection. If the girlfriend was indeed in a coercive situation, the author's immediate dismissal might not be supportive. On the other hand, his trust was broken, and he might have felt betrayed.\n\nBut the key issue here is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain the situation properly. He reacted based on his assumptions without considering her perspective. If she was being raped, his reaction could prevent her from getting help. However, if she was lying, his action might be justified. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the fact that he didn't listen to her explanation and acted on his own judgment without seeking the truth first is a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. His immediate reaction to kick her out without a proper discussion could be seen as the wrong approach. He might have been in the right to be concerned, but his handling of the situation was flawed. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A) because he didn't handle it with the necessary care and consideration for her potential trauma."
