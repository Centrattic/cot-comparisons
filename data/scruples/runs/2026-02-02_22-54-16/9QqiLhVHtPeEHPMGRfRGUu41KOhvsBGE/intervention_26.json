Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author of the post is a boyfriend who suspects his girlfriend of cheating. He noticed several red flags: she was acting strangely when searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. Then, he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, which led him to confront her. She responded by saying she was being raped, which he found inconsistent with the other behaviors like dressing up and having condoms. He kicked her out, and now he's unsure if he made the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is reacting to what he perceives as cheating. But when confronted, the girlfriend claims she's being raped. The author is confused because the behaviors he observed don't align with that claim. On one hand, he might be overreacting based on assumptions. On the other hand, he found evidence (condoms) that he believes indicate cheating.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. If she's saying she's being raped, that's a very different situation. However, the author is questioning the validity of her claim because of the other behaviors. The problem here is whether the author is justified in doubting her claim of rape, especially since she hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's possible explanations, she mentions that sometimes abuse victims can't leave. That's a known fact in domestic abuse cases where victims might feel trapped. However, the author is confused because the presence of condoms and her dressing up seems contradictory. But in a rape scenario, the victim might not have a choice in the matter, and the presence of condoms could be for other reasons, maybe to prevent pregnancy, or perhaps the perpetrator is pressuring her into using them.\n\nHowever, the author's approach to confronting her was abrupt and invasive. He found the condoms in her purse, which could be seen as a privacy violation. Even though he's a boyfriend, going through her things without consent might not be the best approach. But he mentions he found the box while looking for Advil, which might be a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. He's in a position where he's hurting and trying to make sense of the situation. But when she claims she's being raped, he should take that seriously. However, his immediate reaction was to kick her out, possibly without giving her a chance to explain further. That raises questions about his handling of the situation.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's behavior, if she is actually being raped, she might be in a very vulnerable state. However, if her actions don't align with that claim (dressing up, having condoms), there might be inconsistencies. But it's also possible that she's being manipulated or coerced into situations that don't fit typical expectations.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be how he handled the confrontation. Instead of immediately doubting her claim of rape and kicking her out, he might have needed to seek professional help or support to verify the situation. His actions could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma, but on the other hand, he's reacting to evidence he finds suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult position. He's confused and hurt, and his reaction might stem from feelings of betrayal. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious matter that should not be dismissed lightly. The author's approach could be seen as harsh, but his doubts are based on observed behaviors. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. However, the author's immediate reaction of ending the relationship without fully understanding the context might not be the best course of action. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the validity of her claim and his approach. Since the situation is unclear, and given that the girlfriend's claim of rape is a severe accusation, the author's reaction could be seen as not in the wrong because he was acting on the evidence he had, even if his method was flawed.\n"
