Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend having a secret stash of condoms, acting suspiciously, and then claiming she's being raped when confronted.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He found the condoms, got upset, and kicked her out. He felt betrayed and didn't believe her explanation. The girlfriend claims she was being raped but that doesn't add up with her behavior (e.g., dressing up, having condoms). \n\nNow, considering consent. If she's being raped, that's a serious accusation. But if she's in a situation where she can't leave and is forced, maybe she's in an abusive relationship. However, the author's immediate reaction was distrust and ending the relationship without really hearing her out. \n\nThe author's mistake was not trusting her and assuming the worst without giving her a chance to explain. The girlfriend's behavior might be a red flag, but jumping to conclusions and not allowing her to explain her side could be his fault. Also, the way he confronted her (taking the box, walking into the bathroom) might have been harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were definitely suspicious. The author had reasons to be concerned. However, the way he handled the confrontation and his immediate dismissal of her claim (especially the rape accusation) could be problematic. He might have invalidated her feelings or not taken the situation seriously enough, or maybe he did but reacted in a way that's not healthy.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's claim of rape being unconvincing because of her actions (using fancy dress, condoms) might be a cover-up for cheating. However, the author didn't verify the facts. He just assumed she was cheating and dismissed her serious accusation without understanding. \n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's possible guilt, if she's lying about rape to cover cheating, that's worse. But the author's actions in the situation: not giving her a chance to explain, being confrontational, and ending the relationship immediately. That's his fault. So he might be the asshole in how he handled it, even if she was lying. Because he didn't handle it with care or allow for her side to be heard.\n\nBut some might say that the girlfriend's behavior was manipulative, and the author was justified in walking away. However, the way he handled it and not taking her rape claim seriously (even if it's a lie) could be seen as a problem. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't approach the situation with empathy or give her a proper explanation. He made assumptions and reacted impulsively.\n"
