Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, finding a box of condoms, and then she claims she was being raped. The author is conflicted about whether to believe her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author noticed some suspicious behavior: her acting strangely while looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she says she was being raped. The author's reaction is to kick her out, feeling hurt and betrayed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the girlfriend's explanation is that she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. If that's true, then the author's immediate reaction of not believing her could be problematic. However, the author points out inconsistencies: her dressing up and having condoms doesn't align with a rape scenario. Also, her behavior before the confrontation was odd, which the author found suspicious.\n\nBut wait, rape victims often don't dress a certain way on purpose. The situation is complex because the girlfriend claims the rape was ongoing and she couldn't leave. The author might not understand the dynamics of such a situation. On the other hand, the author's actions, like searching her purse and finding the condoms, might be seen as invasive, even if done out of concern.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out after being told about the rape. That could be seen as dismissing her trauma. However, if the author had no reason to doubt her story beyond the situation's inconsistency, maybe not. But the author had prior red flags, which complicates things. The key here is whether the author had a right to be suspicious given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's claim of rape is very serious. If the author didn't believe her, that could be an issue, especially if she was genuinely a victim. However, the author's observations of her behavior before the incident might make his skepticism understandable. The problem is that without evidence, it's hard to say. The author might have acted out of jealousy but also had valid concerns about inconsistencies.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified. If he had a reasonable suspicion based on her actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he dismissed her valid trauma without giving her the benefit of the doubt, he could be. However, the girlfriend's explanation being about being abused and unable to leave adds another layer. The author might not have the full context, leading to a conflict between trust and suspicion. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The author's actions were based on his perceptions, but his response was to end the relationship without fully processing her claim. That might be seen as harsh, but if he believed she was lying, perhaps it's justified. The situation is tricky because both sides have valid points. However, the girlfriend made a serious accusation, and the author's failure to believe her without more information could be seen as a problem.\n"
