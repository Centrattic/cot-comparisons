Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong after he kicked his girlfriend out when he found condoms in her purse.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend noticed some red flags: she was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms, which led him to believe she was cheating. But she claimed she was being raped. He kicked her out, and she's upset about being dismissed without hearing her explanation.\n\nNow, the key issue here is the assumption he made. He found the condoms and immediately assumed she was cheating. However, she said she was a victim of rape. The problem is, he didn't give her a chance to explain further before reacting. While his actions (finding her phone behavior, etc.) might have been justified in making him suspicious, his response could be problematic. \n\nHe didn't verify her story. If she truly was a victim of rape, that's a serious accusation, and he should have sought to understand more before making a judgment. His reaction might have been too harsh without hearing her side. Also, the fact that she claimed to have been raped but had the condoms (which could be used for protection in a non-consensual situation, though that's not typical) adds complexity. However, his immediate disbelief and decision to end the relationship without further discussion could be seen as dismissive of her possible trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, he had reasons to be suspicious, especially with the red flags he mentioned. But reacting by kicking her out based on his own assumptions without giving her a chance to explain might be where he went wrong. The situation is complicated, but his lack of communication and immediate judgment could make him the asshole. So, maybe answer A (he's in the wrong).\n"
