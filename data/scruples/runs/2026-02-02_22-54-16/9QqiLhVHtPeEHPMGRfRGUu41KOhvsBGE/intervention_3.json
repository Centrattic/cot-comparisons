Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The author is conflicted, thinking she might be lying but also feeling hurt and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The key points here are the red flags the author noticed: his girlfriend acting strangely when using her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting the phone away, and finding a box of condoms. When confronted, she breaks down and says she's being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, feeling that her explanation doesn't make sense because of the contradictions (dressing up, having condoms, etc.).\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so they want to see if that's accurate.\n\nI should consider the ethical and social aspects. Accusing someone of rape without clear evidence can be extremely serious. The author didn't have proof but had suspicions based on behavior. However, when the girlfriend provided an explanation of being raped, the author's reaction was harsh\u2014kicking her out and ending the relationship. The girlfriend might feel that the author dismissed her trauma and didn't support her, which could be a significant issue. On the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt and confused, especially if the behavior was out of character and led to a confrontation where the girlfriend's explanation seemed inconsistent.\n\nBut here's the thing: the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. The author's immediate reaction of anger and disbelief could be problematic. Even if he suspected cheating, he should have approached the situation with more empathy and support, especially when she's emotionally distressed. The fact that he reacted with anger and didn't take the time to listen or verify could mean he's in the wrong, as he might have invalidated her experience or made her feel unsupported. However, if her story didn't add up, maybe he's justified in being skeptical. But without concrete evidence, his response could be seen as dismissive of her trauma.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, having condoms) doesn't necessarily contradict her being a rape survivor. Rape is a traumatic event and doesn't depend on the victim's behavior or attire. The author's assumption that her actions indicate consent or lying is a common misunderstanding and could be seen as blaming the victim. The correct approach would be to support her regardless of inconsistencies in her story, as trauma can affect how someone behaves.\n\nSo, the author's immediate reaction of not believing her and ending the relationship might be the asshole part. Even if he had suspicions, the way he handled the confrontation was harsh, and he should have considered that her claim of being raped could be genuine, despite the confusing circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't support his girlfriend in a situation where she might be vulnerable and instead reacted with anger and disbelief, which is harmful regardless of the truth.\n"
