Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for thinking their girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The backstory involves the girlfriend talking to a guy named Rick, and the author notices some red flags like her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, and hiding her phone. Then, he finds a box of Magnum condoms in her purse and confronts her, leading to her claiming she was being raped.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is his assumption that the girlfriend is cheating based on the red flags he observed. However, when confronted, she claims she was being raped. The author then kicks her out, feeling betrayed and angry. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. The author's initial suspicion is based on his observations, which might be reasonable for him, but it's important to note that people can misinterpret behavior. However, when the girlfriend makes a serious accusation of rape, the appropriate response would typically be to support her, not immediately assume she's lying. Rape is a severe allegation, and the immediate reaction of the author was to doubt her, leading to a breakup without fully understanding her side.\n\nThe girlfriend's explanation about being abused and not able to leave might be a red flag for the author, but he doesn't give her a chance to elaborate. Instead, he reacts with anger and disbelief. This could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma. However, the author is also a victim of betrayal if she was indeed cheating. But the key point here is whether he was wrong to not believe her claim of being raped. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses being a victim of sexual assault, the first reaction should be to offer support and believe them unless there's clear evidence of deception. The author's reaction\u2014immediately doubting her and using the condoms as proof\u2014might be seen as invalidating her experience. The fact that he didn't seek more information or consider that she might be in an abusive situation is problematic. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the circumstances (dressing up, hiding the phone, Magnum condoms) seemed inconsistent with being a victim of rape. But without knowing the full context, it's possible she was in a coercive situation where she felt forced to engage in sexual activity, maybe with someone who had power over her. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior after the accusation\u2014crying and saying he doesn't care\u2014suggests that she felt hurt by his reaction. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified if he felt betrayed, but his initial response of disbelief when she claimed rape is a significant issue. It's possible that the author's lack of support could be seen as not taking her trauma seriously.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, it's crucial to believe and support victims of sexual assault. The author's immediate reaction of disbelief and anger might be considered wrong, especially if the girlfriend was telling the truth. However, without more context about their relationship and the girlfriend's potential deceit, it's hard to say definitively. \n\nBut given that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the key point is the response to the rape accusation, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't support her and instead reacted with anger and disbelief, possibly invalidating her trauma. However, there's also a nuance here because the author had reasons to suspect infidelity, which complicates things. But when someone makes a serious accusation like rape, the immediate reaction should be to believe them, not to confront them with evidence that could be misinterpreted (like the condoms). \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't support his girlfriend when she claimed to be a victim of rape, instead choosing to believe she was lying based on his own suspicions without giving her a chance to explain further. His reaction was dismissive of her potential trauma, which is a significant issue.\n"
