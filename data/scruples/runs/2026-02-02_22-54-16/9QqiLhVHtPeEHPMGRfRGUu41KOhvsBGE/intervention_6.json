Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves him finding a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse, getting upset, and then she explains she was being raped. He responded by kicking her out and cutting contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The red flags he noticed: her acting strangely around the phone, dressing up unusually, and the condom discovery. When he confronted her, she said she was being raped, which he found hard to believe because of the context. He's conflicted between wanting to hear her out and feeling like it's a lie.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. In a relationship, when someone finds something that seems suspicious, their reaction can be influenced by their emotions and past experiences. But the girlfriend's explanation of being raped is a serious accusation. The author's immediate reaction was anger and disbelief, which might come off as dismissive. However, the behavior he described (dressing up, having condoms, avoiding phone contact) doesn't align with a typical scenario of rape. Usually, a person being raped wouldn't be in a situation where they have consensual condom use while dressed up to go out with friends. That seems contradictory. \n\nBut the problem is that he didn't give her a chance to fully explain. He reacted impulsively, taking the action of kicking her out. Even if he's right about her lying, his approach could be seen as invalidating her potential trauma. However, the situation also seems a bit off. The girlfriend's behavior doesn't fit the narrative of being a victim of rape. Maybe it's a misunderstanding or a lie, but either way, the author's response might have been too harsh. \n\nOn one hand, he has a right to be concerned about possible infidelity and to set boundaries. On the other hand, his immediate assumption that she was cheating without considering other possibilities (or maybe not giving her a chance to explain) might be the issue. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a severe statement, and even if he was suspicious, the appropriate response would be to listen and support her rather than accuse her of lying. \n\nBut there's a part of me that thinks the situation as described might not involve actual rape. The behavior doesn't add up. However, the author's reaction to her explanation is what's in question here. He might have acted in the wrong by not being open to her explanation, even if he didn't believe it. Breaking up without understanding the full context could be seen as dismissive, especially if she was in a real situation. \n\nSo, considering the information given, the author might not be in the wrong because the behaviors he observed don't align with a typical rape scenario, and his feelings are justified. But from a relationship standpoint, his handling of the situation could be problematic. The answer would depend on whether his reaction was based on reasonable suspicion or if he was quick to jump to conclusions without giving her a fair chance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's explanation is contradictory to her actions and he had reasons to be concerned, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he dismissed her without proper support, then he might be. The post says he asked if she thought he was \"fucking stupid\" and kicked her out. That suggests he didn't believe her and acted harshly. However, the situation's details are conflicting. \n\nSo, if the answer is A (yes, he's wrong) it's because he didn't give her a chance to explain or support her, but if B (he's not in the wrong) because her behavior didn't add up. I'm leaning towards B because the situation as described has inconsistencies that he's pointing out, and his reaction was based on those observations. However, the way he handled the confrontation might be an issue. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are binary. Given the information, I think the author is not in the wrong because the behaviors he noticed don't align with the rape claim. So the answer is B.\n"
