Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend had some suspicious behavior, like acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, and the discovery of a box of condoms. Then the author confronted her, and she claimed she was being raped. The author is questioning if he's the asshole for not believing her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's actions: he noticed red flags and found condoms, which led him to confront her. He was hurt and kicked her out. She responded with the rape claim, which is a serious accusation. He's now unsure if he was right to not believe her.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a severe allegation. If true, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or invalidating. However, there are some red flags mentioned that make the rape claim suspicious. The behavior like dressing up, having the specific type of condom (Magnum), and her delayed reaction might not align with a typical scenario of rape. Also, the author didn't immediately accuse her of cheating but was trying to understand the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's explanation that she couldn't leave because of abuse is a common trauma response, but the author might not have known that. However, he found the condoms, which are typically used for consensual sex, making the rape claim less likely. The author's emotional reaction is understandable given the context, but he did kick her out after she made the accusation, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nIn terms of trust and communication, the author's actions in searching her purse without consent could be a violation of privacy. But the situation is complicated. The girlfriend's accusation of rape is a serious one, and the author might have overreacted, but given the evidence (condoms) and her behavior, he might have had some justification for his skepticism.\n\nThe key points here are the credibility of the rape claim versus the evidence of possible infidelity, the author's right to feel betrayed, and the appropriateness of his response. The girlfriend's claim being \"non-consensual\" but having the means (condoms) and dressing up could suggest otherwise. The author's anger and needing an explanation are valid, but his reaction of kicking her out and not allowing her to explain further might be too abrupt.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong given the conflicting information and his need to protect himself, but there's a balance between trust and the evidence he found. However, the girlfriend's serious accusation complicates things. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he acted on the evidence he had, even if he might not have handled it perfectly.\n"
