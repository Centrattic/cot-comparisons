Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in their girlfriend's purse and immediately assumed she was cheating. Then, when confronted, she said she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. Accusing someone of cheating without solid evidence can be a big deal. Condoms being present doesn't necessarily mean cheating. Maybe she was planning to protect herself in case of an unwanted encounter. But the author jumps to conclusions, which could be a sign of distrust or jealousy.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's claim of being raped. Even if the author doesn't believe her, it's a serious accusation. If she was actually being raped, kicking her out could be very harmful. But if she lied about it, then the author might have been right to cut ties. However, the situation is complex because the girlfriend's behavior (like fancy dresses, hiding her phone) could be signs of something else, like abuse.\n\nThe key point is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain properly before reacting. They took the box as proof of cheating, but that's not conclusive. Also, accusing someone of lying about rape is extremely serious. Even if the author felt betrayed, the appropriate response might have been to support her, seek help, or consult a professional. Instead, he immediately broke up with her, which might have been too hasty.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's behavior. If she was being abused, she might not have felt comfortable explaining at first. Maybe she was in denial or embarrassed. The author's reaction could have made her feel unsupported, which is a problem. But if she was indeed lying, then the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nHowever, the presence of Magnum condoms doesn't automatically mean cheating. It's a personal choice in contraceptive method. The author's assumption here shows a lack of trust. Also, reacting by taking the box and going to the bathroom might have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's \"freezing\" could indicate shock, fear, or guilt, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe author's decision to kick her out without a proper discussion might be the issue. They didn't validate her feelings or offer support. If she was genuinely being raped, cutting her off would be inconsiderate. If she's lying, then the author is protecting themselves from a deceitful relationship. But without more evidence, it's hard to determine the truth.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author's actions here might stem from insecurity or jealousy, leading to a breakdown in communication. They didn't approach the situation with empathy, which is a problem. Even if the girlfriend was lying, the way the author handled it could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was telling the truth, the author's response was dismissive and harmful.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's immediate assumption of cheating and the girlfriend's claim of rape create a conflict. The author's actions might stem from their own insecurities and lack of communication. They didn't take the time to understand the situation fully. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend the benefit of the doubt and for making a snap judgment based on circumstantial evidence. They should have approached the situation with more empathy and a willingness to listen before taking such drastic action.\n"
