Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The author then dumps her, and now he's unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend acting distracted around him, dressing up unusually, and hiding her phone. Then he found condoms in her purse, leading to an argument where she claims she's being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's conflicted.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, he had reasons to be suspicious based on her changed behavior and the discovery of condoms. Finding condoms in a relationship where you're the partner can be a red flag, especially if it's not for you. His reaction\u2014feeling hurt and angry\u2014is understandable in that context.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious. The author didn't wait for an explanation, reacted emotionally, and ended the relationship. However, the girlfriend's \"explanation\" (that she's being raped while dressed up and with condoms) raises questions. If she was indeed being raped, why would she have condoms? Why the secrecy? This inconsistency might make the author's doubt valid.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author didn't give her a proper chance to explain. He took her explanation at face value without seeking more information. If she was being raped, that's a traumatic situation, and his immediate reaction might not have been supportive. However, the girlfriend's behavior and the context (condoms, dressing up) don't align with a typical rape scenario where the victim is coerced. That might make the author's skepticism somewhat reasonable, but he didn't handle it well.\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" aspect, the author is conflicted. He's torn between wanting to believe her but doubting her explanation. The key is that he didn't address the situation calmly. Instead of confronting her about the red flags and seeking clarification, he reacted impulsively by ending the relationship upon finding the condoms. That's where he might be in the wrong. Even if he had suspicions, a more mature approach would be to talk it out, ask for explanations, and not make assumptions without evidence.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior of acting secretive and hiding the condoms could suggest infidelity rather than rape. But if she was actually being raped, that's a serious issue. However, the author's initial judgment is based on his observations, and he might have been wrong to dismiss her claim without a proper investigation. But at the same time, the inconsistency in her story (dressing up, having condoms for a non-consensual act) might make her claim less credible.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's immediate reaction to end the relationship without seeking a thorough explanation could be seen as hasty. He had valid suspicions, but his handling of the situation\u2014without giving her a chance to provide more context\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's claim of rape was a lie, then the author's decision to leave might be justified. The problem is the lack of evidence on both sides. Given that the author didn't give her a proper opportunity to explain, he could be in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) for not handling it with more care and seeking understanding before reacting."
