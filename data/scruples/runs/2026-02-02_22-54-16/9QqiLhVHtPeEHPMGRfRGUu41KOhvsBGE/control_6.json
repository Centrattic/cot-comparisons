Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author suspects his girlfriend of cheating and then she claims she's being raped. He kicks her out, but later questions her story because of the condoms and the way she was acting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors, like her acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and the condoms found in her purse. When confronted, she says she's being raped, which is a serious accusation. The author feels betrayed and kicks her out but later questions her story because the scenario doesn't quite make sense to him\u2014like why would someone being raped have condoms and dress up for it?\n\nNow, legally, if someone is being raped, that's a criminal matter. The author didn't report it to the authorities immediately. Instead, he chose to handle it by ending the relationship. If the girlfriend's claim was genuine, then the author didn't support her and might be violating any duty to report a crime or offer support. However, if the claim was a cover for cheating, then the author's actions make sense. The problem is that the author is doubting her claim based on inconsistencies he observes, but he doesn't have proof either way.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, if her claim was true, then he dismissed her without proper support. On the other, if she was lying, he might have acted correctly by ending a deceptive relationship. But the key here is that the girlfriend made a serious accusation of rape. In many places, making a false rape accusation is a serious offense, but assuming someone is lying about such a thing without evidence could be problematic. The author didn't seek to verify her story through proper channels\u2014like the police or a counselor\u2014before dismissing it.\n\nAlso, the act of finding condoms and her reaction might not align with a genuine rape situation. Condoms could be for other reasons, but the author's immediate assumption is that she's cheating. However, the girlfriend's explanation is that she's being raped, which is a non-consensual act. The author is in a dilemma here. Without more information, it's hard to say. But the main issue is that he didn't take the accusation seriously enough to pursue it further. If she was actually being raped, he didn't help her. If she was lying, then he acted on suspicion. But the problem is that he's questioning her claim based on his own logic without proper investigation.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author's actions might be seen as not supporting a partner who claims a serious crime is happening. However, he also had reason to be suspicious given her behavior. The answer might depend on cultural or societal expectations, but generally, if someone makes a claim of rape, the appropriate response is to support them and encourage them to seek help, not to question their story and kick them out. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her and for doubting her claim without a proper investigation.\n"
