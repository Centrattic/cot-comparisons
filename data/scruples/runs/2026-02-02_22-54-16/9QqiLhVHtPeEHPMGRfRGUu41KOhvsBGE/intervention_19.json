Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend discovering condoms in his girlfriend's purse and reacting by kicking her out, as she claimed she was being raped. The boyfriend is now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The boyfriend noticed several red flags: her secretive behavior, sudden change in appearance, and the presence of condoms. When he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she responded with a claim of being raped. He then ended the relationship.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, the girlfriend's accusation of rape seems questionable. If she was being raped, why would she be making plans with the person, getting dressed up, and having condoms? These actions don't align with a non-consensual situation. However, the boyfriend's approach in confronting her by taking the condoms without her consent could be seen as invasive. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend mentions he doesn't snoop, so maybe he felt justified in looking for Advil. The key point is the girlfriend's claim of rape. If that's a lie, then the boyfriend's reaction might be understandable. However, if she was genuinely in distress and the rape is real, then his reaction could be harsh. But the context given doesn't support the rape claim; her behavior contradicts it. \n\nThe boyfriend's immediate reaction was anger and disbelief, which is human, but the girlfriend's accusation could be a manipulation tactic. The boyfriend's right to feel betrayed is valid if she lied. However, the way he found out might not have been the best approach. But the core issue is her claim of rape being a lie, which is a serious accusation. \n\nIn terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? The boyfriend acted based on suspicion and found something that made him confront her. Her lying about rape is a major issue. The boyfriend isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship given the lie and the red flags. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
