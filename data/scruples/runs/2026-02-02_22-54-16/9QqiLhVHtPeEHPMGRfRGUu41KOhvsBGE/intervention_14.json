Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in their girlfriend's purse when she was about to leave to meet her friends, and this led to a confrontation where the girlfriend claimed she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed some red flags: the girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up in fancy clothes which was out of character, tilting her phone away. Then, when he found the condoms, she broke down crying and said she was being raped. The author is conflicted because on one hand, they want an explanation, but on the other, they suspect lies.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not, but wants my opinion. Let's consider the possible angles. The author's actions include looking through the girlfriend's purse without her permission, which is a privacy invasion. That's a point against them. However, the girlfriend's behavior was suspicious and out of character, leading to the author's concern. \n\nThe author's assumption that she was cheating led to the confrontation. But the girlfriend's claim of being raped while having condoms raises skepticism. The author's reaction (kicking her out, refusing to communicate) might be harsh if the claim is true, but if it's a lie, then the author is justified in ending the relationship. \n\nIn terms of the law, if the girlfriend was actually being raped, the author could be blamed for not believing her and ending the relationship. However, the scenario is more about trust and the girlfriend's credibility. The author's initial actions were based on suspicion from red flags, which he might have interpreted as infidelity. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of \"getting raped\" seems like an overreaction to being confronted about the condoms. The author's refusal to accept that explanation and their decision to end the relationship might be seen as wrong if she was indeed being harmed. But if she's lying, then the author's actions are a defense of their own dignity and the relationship's integrity. \n\nHowever, the author's approach of confronting without open dialogue and invading privacy is problematic. The right thing would be to have a conversation first, listen to her, and assess the situation. Kicking her out and not allowing her to explain could be unwise if the situation is serious. \n\nSo balancing both sides: the author's suspicion led to an action that could be seen as harsh, but the girlfriend's out-of-character behavior and the inconsistent statement (carrying condoms while claiming rape) might support the author's doubt. However, the author should have handled it differently, like discussing the red flags first rather than confronting with the condom discovery. \n\nIn terms of the question, the answer is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author acted on his suspicion without perhaps a more open discussion, but the girlfriend's claim seems contradictory, it's a tough call. However, the initial act of invading privacy (checking the purse) and the immediate decision to end the relationship without further communication might be where the author is in the wrong. But the girlfriend's explanation is questionable. \n\nI think the key here is that the girlfriend's claim of rape while having condoms in her possession is inconsistent. If she was actually being raped, she wouldn't have the condoms, which are typically used for consensual sex. So the author's doubt is rational. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014invading privacy, not giving her a chance to explain properly\u2014could be seen as wrong. But the post is about the author's belief that she wasn't actually being raped. The question is if he's in the wrong for thinking she wasn't. \n\nThe woman's claim of being raped while under these circumstances is a big issue. If she was lying about being raped, then the author's suspicion is valid. But even if she was lying, the act of not believing her could be problematic. However, the author's red flags and the inconsistency of her statement are there. \n\nIn a real situation, it's important to approach such allegations with care and not make assumptions. The author should have first listened to her, perhaps sought to understand her story, and not acted so quickly. But the post is about the author thinking she wasn't actually being raped based on the situation. \n\nGiven that, the author's thought process isn't necessarily wrong in questioning the scenario, but his actions in response (kicking her out, not allowing her to explain) are. The main question is if the author is in the wrong for thinking she wasn't being raped. So the answer would be B (No) because the author's skepticism is based on observable inconsistencies, but the handling of the situation is where he's at fault. However, the initial part of the question is whether he's in the wrong for his thinking, not the actions. The answer depends on whether the author's belief is justified. \n\nIf the girlfriend's claim is inconsistent (carrying condoms and dressing up for friends), the author isn't wrong to question it. So the answer would be B (No). But if the author's actions (like invading privacy) are wrong, that's a separate issue. The question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong for thinking the girlfriend wasn't being raped. So the answer is B (No), but the way he handled it is problematic.\n"
