Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a guy who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse, which made him think she was cheating, but she claimed she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author noticed some red flags: his girlfriend was acting weird when looking for her phone, dressing up with fancy clothes and makeup, tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which he thought were for cheating. But she says she's being raped and that it's a side effect, like in abuse cases where the victim can't leave. He broke up with her, thinking she might be lying.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. From the story, he's making assumptions based on his observations. However, his reaction led to a breakup without fully understanding her side. The problem is that he didn't communicate effectively. Instead of confronting her with his concerns and asking for an explanation, he reacted emotionally and kicked her out. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's behavior is suspicious. She's been dressing up and hiding her phone, and now there are condoms. She's giving an excuse about being raped but hasn't had a history of such issues. The author is in a dilemma: he could be wrong to accuse her of lying about a serious matter like rape, which is a huge deal. On the other hand, her explanations might not hold up, like why she's getting dressed up and has condoms if it's non-consensual.\n\nRape is a serious accusation, and the girlfriend's claim needs to be taken seriously. If she was indeed being raped, the author's response could be seen as dismissive and not supportive. However, the girlfriend might be using an emotional appeal to justify her actions. The author's reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling betrayed and not knowing how to handle the situation. \n\nBut the main issue here is the author's approach. He didn't try to have a calm conversation to understand her situation. Instead, he felt hurt and angry and ended things abruptly. That's where the problem lies. Even if he had suspicions, breaking up without a proper discussion might be hasty. Also, the girlfriend might have felt the need to explain in a way that's not entirely truthful, but the author's role isn't to accuse her of rape, but to address the trust issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with the necessary care and communication. He should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and perhaps sought a conversation to understand her explanation before making a decision. However, the girlfriend's behavior is also questionable. But the question is about the author's actions. Since he didn't allow her to explain and reacted impulsively, that's a flaw. So the answer is A.\n"
