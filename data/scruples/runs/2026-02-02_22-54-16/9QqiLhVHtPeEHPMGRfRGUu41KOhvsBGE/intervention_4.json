Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in their girlfriend's purse when she was going to meet her friends. The girlfriend then claimed she was being raped, but the author didn't believe her and broke up with her. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) or not (not the asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some red flags: her girlfriend was acting strangely, searching for her phone, dressing up in a way that's unusual for her, tilting her phone away. Then when the author found the condoms, the girlfriend explained it was because she was being raped. The author found this hard to believe given the other behaviors (like dressing up and having condoms) and decided to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication. In a relationship, if there's a lack of trust, that can be problematic. The author might have felt suspicious, but they didn't confront the girlfriend directly before finding the condoms. Instead, they acted on their suspicions, which led to a confrontation. \n\nThe girlfriend's explanation was that she was being raped but was dressed up and had condoms. The author found that contradictory. However, there are cases where someone might have to take precautions if they are in a situation where they fear being forced, even if that's not the case. But the girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, using condoms) might not align with the claim of non-consensual activity. \n\nBut then again, the author's assumption might be wrong. Maybe the girlfriend was in a situation where she was being pressured or manipulated, and the condoms were for protection. However, the author immediately dismissed her explanation without giving her the benefit of the doubt, leading to breaking up the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was justified. If the author had no prior reason to distrust the girlfriend and acted on circumstantial evidence without a direct conversation, they might be at fault. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's behavior was indeed suspicious and the explanation didn't add up, the author might be justified in ending the relationship to protect themselves from potential lies or deceit.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's claim of being raped. If that's true, it's a serious issue, and the author should support her. But the author is reacting to a situation where the girlfriend's actions don't align with the claim, which could be a red flag. However, the author's approach of breaking up immediately without a proper discussion could be seen as harsh, especially if the girlfriend was genuinely in distress.\n\nIn some cases, people might not explain their situations clearly, especially if they're in shock or trauma. The author might have misjudged the situation. But the girlfriend's behavior (like pretending to be raped to get out of something) could be a sign of manipulation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong if they felt that the girlfriend's explanation was inconsistent with her actions and decided to end the relationship. However, the way they handled it (immediately breaking up without a full discussion) could be seen as hasty. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's story doesn't add up and the author has a right to be concerned about potential deceit, then the author might be justified. However, if the girlfriend was actually being raped, the author's reaction of not supporting her could be wrong. But since the girlfriend's story is conflicting, the author might be right to be skeptical.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether the author acted unreasonably. Since the author found a box of condoms and the girlfriend's story doesn't align with her actions, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is B (No).\n"
