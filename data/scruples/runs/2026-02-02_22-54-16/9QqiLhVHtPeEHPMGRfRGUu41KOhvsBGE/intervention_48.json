Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she told him she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed some red flags: her acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which he realized weren't for him because they were Magnum size. She then claims she's being raped. He doesn't believe her and ends the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. Well, from an ethical standpoint, there's a lot here. The author made assumptions based on circumstantial evidence. Finding condoms in her purse doesn't necessarily mean cheating or that she's being raped. She claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. If that's true, then the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her trauma. On the other hand, if she was lying, then the author might have been justified in ending the relationship due to lack of trust.\n\nBut here's the catch: false accusations of rape are extremely rare, but when they do happen, they can be devastating. However, the author didn't have proof of cheating. The girlfriend's explanation was that she couldn't leave the situation, which is a known dynamic in abuse. The author's immediate reaction was to not believe her and kick her out, which could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nAlso, the author's own behavior\u2014like looking through her purse to find Advil and then discovering the condoms\u2014might be questionable. Privacy is a big issue here. Even if he was looking for Advil, taking the box of condoms and reacting that way could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which might contribute to the breakdown of trust.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's behavior was inconsistent with her claim. If she was being raped, dressing up fancy and having condoms might not align. However, trauma responses can be complex, and someone in an abusive situation might act unpredictably. The author might not be in the wrong for not trusting her, but he also might be in the wrong for not giving her the benefit of the doubt given the seriousness of her claim.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction was immediate and severe. He kicked her out without giving her a chance to explain further. If she was being raped, he could have supported her instead of ending the relationship. But if it was a lie, then his reaction was justified.\n\nSo where does that leave us? The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing her. In many cases, it's advised to listen and support someone who discloses abuse, even if the story doesn't make sense. But the author had his own red flags. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or societal perspectives on trust and abuse.\n\nIn the end, the author made a judgment based on his observations and his instincts. While his method of handling it (finding the condoms, invading privacy) could be criticized, the core issue is whether he was wrong to question her claim. Given that she made a serious accusation without providing concrete evidence, and the author felt betrayed, he might not be in the wrong. However, there's a risk that by not believing her, he might have dismissed a genuine situation. But given the information he had, his reaction might be seen as a self-preservation step. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
