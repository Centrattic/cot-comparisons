Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse when he was looking for Advil. He immediately assumed she was cheating, but she said she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The guy noticed some red flags: her acting strangely around the phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away. Then finding the condoms led him to his conclusion. The girlfriend's explanation was that she was being raped, but the guy didn't believe her. \n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. But there are some inconsistencies. If she was being raped, why would she dress up and have condoms? That seems contradictory. Condoms are typically used for consensual sex, so if she was being raped, she wouldn't need them. Plus, the fact that she was going out with friends and acting in a way that's out of character could support the idea that she was meeting someone for a consensual encounter. \n\nBut on the other hand, the guy didn't give her a chance to explain properly. He reacted immediately with anger and kicked her out. The girlfriend said she was being raped, which is a serious matter, and he dismissed it without considering her perspective. Even if his suspicion was based on the circumstances, he didn't handle it well. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend was actually being raped, then his reaction was harsh and unjust. But if she was lying, then he was right to be suspicious. However, the problem is that he didn't seek any evidence or talk to her calmly first. He assumed the worst and took extreme action. \n\nIn terms of the \"Asshole Index\" (AITA) questions, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The guy's red flags might be valid, but his handling of the situation was impulsive. He should have had a conversation instead of immediately accusing her and breaking up. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior was inconsistent with being a victim of rape. Victims of rape typically don't dress up or carry condoms for their attackers. So maybe the guy's suspicion was right, but his approach was wrong. \n\nHowever, the main issue is that he didn't give her a chance to explain. The girlfriend might have had a legitimate reason, but he didn't listen. So the question is whether he's in the wrong for not believing her when she said she was being raped. But the way he handled it (immediately kicking her out, calling her a cheater) is problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy might have had some valid suspicions, but his response was hasty and he didn't handle it properly. The girlfriend's accusation of rape is serious, and he should have approached it with more sensitivity and a willingness to listen, even if he was skeptical. So, maybe he's not completely in the wrong, but he did make a mistake in how he reacted. However, if the girlfriend was lying, then he's justified. But since we don't have all the facts, the community might see his reaction as harsh.\n"
