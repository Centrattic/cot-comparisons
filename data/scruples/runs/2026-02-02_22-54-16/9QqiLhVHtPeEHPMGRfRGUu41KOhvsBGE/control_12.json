Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (AITA) found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse when he was looking for Advil. He immediately assumed she was cheating, took the box into the bathroom, confronted her, and she claimed she was being raped. He then kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some red flags before the confrontation, like her being secretive with her phone, acting distracted when looking for it, and suddenly dressing up fancy. He also mentions that he found the condoms, which led him to assume infidelity. However, when confronted, the girlfriend said she was being raped. The author then reacted by kicking her out without fully understanding her side.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author was wrong to act this way. On one hand, he had suspicions based on her behavior. On the other hand, he jumped to conclusions and accused her of cheating without giving her a chance to explain. The girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. However, her explanation seems a bit conflicting\u2014how can someone be dressed up and have condoms if they are being raped? That part is confusing. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't wait for her explanation. He immediately reacted with anger and humiliation, taking the box into the bathroom and then kicking her out. Even if he believed she was lying, he could have given her a chance to explain before ending the relationship. His actions might have been impulsive and not considering her possible distress if she was indeed being raped. Also, by not seeking any proof or understanding, he might have acted on his own assumptions without verifying the situation. \n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's behavior of acting out of character might have been due to being in an abusive situation where she felt she couldn't leave. The author's immediate accusation of cheating and then ending the relationship without a proper discussion could be seen as not supporting her if she was in distress. Even if he later doubts her story, the way he handled the situation might be the issue here. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's possible he is, because he didn't give her a chance to explain her side. The act of grabbing the condom box and reacting so strongly without dialogue could be seen as an overreaction. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious matter that might require more empathy and a willingness to listen before making accusations. So, maybe the author is at fault for not handling the situation more carefully.\n"
