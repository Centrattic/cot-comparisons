Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating after finding condoms in her purse, leading her to claim she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone when talking to Rick, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms and confronted her. She responded by saying she was being raped, which he didn't believe, leading to a breakup. Now he's conflicted about whether he was right to not believe her.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to not accept her claim of being raped. From a moral standpoint, accusing someone of being a liar when they claim they're a victim of a serious crime like rape is a heavy charge. However, the author has listed several red flags that might make someone question the situation. But rape is a non-consensual act, and if she was being forced, she wouldn't be choosing to dress up or have condoms. However, there's also the aspect of trust in a relationship. If the author didn't communicate his concerns earlier and instead acted on his own by checking her purse, that could be seen as violating trust.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone says they're being raped, it's generally not appropriate to immediately accuse them of lying, especially without evidence. The author's reaction might stem from jealousy and suspicion rather than a genuine belief that she's in danger. However, the girlfriend's explanation could be a lie to cover up infidelity. But how can the author be sure?\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further or seek help instead of breaking up. His approach was confrontational and led to the immediate end of the relationship. In situations involving potential abuse, the appropriate response would be to support the person, encourage them to seek help, and not immediately assume guilt. The author's immediate reaction of anger and not believing her might make him the asshole, as he dismissed a serious claim without proper investigation or support.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the girlfriend's behavior. If she was truly being raped, why would she be dressing up, having condoms, and acting suspiciously? That could be a sign that the situation isn't as it seems. But that's speculative. Without more information, it's hard to say. The key point is that the author didn't handle the situation with care; he accused her of lying without giving her a chance to explain properly, leading to the breakup based on his own assumptions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's disbelief and harsh reaction could be seen as wrong because he didn't validate her claim or offer support. However, his actions were based on his observations, which he might have genuinely believed indicated infidelity. But when someone makes a claim of rape, it's a serious matter that should be taken seriously and not dismissed outright. So, the author's response could be considered wrong for not believing her, especially if she was telling the truth. On the other hand, if she was lying, then his actions might be justified, but he should have approached it with more care and not immediately assumed the worst without evidence.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author should have believed her claim of rape despite his suspicions. Given societal context, it's important to believe victims and not immediately accuse them of lying. Therefore, the author's reaction might be seen as wrong because he didn't support her and instead broke up without giving her a chance. But there's also the aspect of his right to be upset about potential cheating. However, the immediate dismissal of her rape claim is problematic. So the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation appropriately and didn't take her claim seriously.\n"
