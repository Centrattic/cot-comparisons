Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, but she says she's being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author noticed some suspicious behavior\u2014like her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more, hiding her phone, and finding condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claims she's being raped, not cheating. The author broke up with her, feeling betrayed and skeptical of her explanation.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether the author was wrong to not believe her. The girlfriend's explanation is that she's a victim of rape, which is a serious accusation. But according to the author, she was dressed up and had condoms. That seems contradictory if it's non-consensual. But why would a victim be dressed up and have condoms? Maybe she's being forced into these situations repeatedly, and the dressing up is a requirement, or the condoms are there to prevent pregnancy, which is a possibility in some cases of abuse. \n\nHowever, the author's actions\u2014finding the condoms and confronting her\u2014could be seen as invasive. He went through her purse without permission, which is a privacy issue. Even if he had suspicions, invading her privacy like that might have been a mistake. But then again, if he had legitimate concerns about her well-being (if she was actually being raped), he might feel compelled to act.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was to cry and say he didn't care, implying that sharing her trauma was supposed to be met with sympathy. But the author was angry because the details didn't add up. The problem is that the author didn't take the time to listen to her explanation before reacting. He kicked her out immediately, which could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma.\n\nBut here's the thing: if she was actually being raped, accusing her of cheating and breaking up with her could be hurtful and invalidating. However, if she lied about being raped to cover up cheating, the author might have been right to be suspicious. The situation is complicated because both sides have points.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not giving her a chance to explain further. Jumping to conclusions and breaking up without seeking more information could be seen as hasty. On the other hand, if he believed she was lying about a serious crime, he might feel justified in ending the relationship. \n\nBut legally and ethically, if someone discloses being raped, even if the circumstances seem odd, the right response is usually to support them and encourage them to seek help, not to accuse them of lying. The author's reaction of anger and immediately ending the relationship might be inconsiderate, especially if she was genuinely in distress. However, he did confront her, and she did say she was being raped. His actions could be seen as not taking her trauma seriously if she was telling the truth.\n\nBut given the contradictions she presented (dressing up, having condoms for non-consensual acts), the author might have had reason to be skeptical. Still, the proper approach would be to support her, not to accuse her of cheating and kick her out. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't support her when she claimed to be a victim of rape, even if he had doubts.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was lying about rape to cover cheating, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if she was actually telling the truth, then he is. However, we don't know the truth. The question is about whether he's an asshole based on his actions. The problem is the immediate judgment without seeking more information. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly, instead of reacting with anger and breaking up. That's where he's in the wrong, because a better approach would be to listen and support her if she truly was a victim. Even if he suspected otherwise, his reaction was harsh and not supportive. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't support her when she disclosed being a victim of rape and instead reacted with anger and accusations without allowing her to fully explain.\n"
