Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating, but she claims she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong to think she wasn't actually getting raped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms and confronted her, leading her to say she was being raped. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about his assumptions. He took the presence of condoms as proof of cheating, but she claims they were for a rape situation. The question is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nBut wait, if someone is being raped, having condoms doesn't make sense because rape is non-consensual. The fact that she was dressing up and using the condoms might contradict her story. However, the author's immediate judgment to kick her out without giving her a chance to explain further could be problematic. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was unusual and there were red flags. The author might have had reasons to be suspicious, but assuming the worst without evidence could be his mistake. However, if she was indeed being raped, his not believing her would be wrong. But the situation is complicated because her actions don't align with a typical rape scenario. \n\nAnother angle: the author found the condoms in a context where his girlfriend had other suspicious behaviors. Magnum condoms are usually for personal use or for someone else. If she was being raped, why would she have them? That seems contradictory. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and not being able to leave might not be a valid excuse here either because she was actively engaging with Rick, which could indicate some level of interaction.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to immediately kick her out without trying to understand her side. But he did ask for an explanation and she provided the rape claim, which he found implausible. The problem is in how he handled the confrontation. Maybe he should have approached it with more empathy or sought evidence instead of making snap judgments. \n\nBut considering the girlfriend's claim of rape could be a serious accusation. If she was telling the truth, then the author's disbelief would be harmful. But the situation is ambiguous. The girlfriend's behavior doesn't fit the typical signs of someone being in an abusive situation. She was dressing up and using her phone to arrange meetings, which might indicate consensual activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted on his suspicion based on the red flags and found evidence (the condoms) which he interpreted as cheating. His girlfriend's explanation seems inconsistent. However, without more information, it's hard to say. The author's mistake might be not believing her possible truth, but considering the contradictions in her story, his reaction might be understandable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had reasons to be suspicious and the girlfriend's claim doesn't hold up under scrutiny.\n"
