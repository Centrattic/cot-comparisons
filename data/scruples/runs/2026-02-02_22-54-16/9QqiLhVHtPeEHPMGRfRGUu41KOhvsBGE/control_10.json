Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was cheating, maybe? But she said she was being raped. He's confused and angry, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend was acting suspicious: looking for her phone frantically, acting distracted, dressing up unusually, hiding her phone, and then there's the condom box. He took this as evidence of cheating, but she claims it's because she's being raped. \n\nWait, how does that add up? If she's being raped, why would she have condoms? That doesn't make sense. Unless maybe she's using them for protection if she's forced, but that's not typical. Also, dressing up fancy for a rapist seems odd. Rapists usually don't ask for dates. But maybe she's in some manipulative situation where the person is coercing her. But the author is skeptical because the signs don't align with a typical non-consensual scenario. \n\nThe girlfriend's explanation is that she's a victim of abuse and can't leave. That could be true, but the situation is complicated. The author's reaction is to kick her out and cut contact. But if she's actually being raped, that's a serious issue. However, the evidence he has (condoms, dressing up) might suggest something else. \n\nNow, the question is, is he wrong for not believing her? If she is telling the truth about being raped, then his reaction is inappropriate. But if she's lying, then he's justified. The problem is we don't know the truth. \n\nBut in situations like this, it's important to consider that false accusations are rare. However, the behavior she's exhibiting doesn't align with a typical rape scenario. Rape is about power and control, not about the victim's attire or having condoms. So maybe she's in an abusive relationship where she's being coerced, but the way she's acting (dressing up, hiding interactions) might be part of that coercion. \n\nThe author's assumption that she's cheating is a big leap. He found condoms but assumed they were for someone else. However, if she's being raped, maybe the condoms are for protection, but that's not usual. Alternatively, maybe she's in a situation where she's being forced into sex and the condoms are for her own safety. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain properly. He reacted strongly, kicked her out, and is now conflicted. If she's in danger, he should have supported her or helped her get help. But if she's lying, then his reaction is justified. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't have any concrete proof of cheating and she claimed a serious issue (rape), dismissing her could be harmful. However, his behavior (checking her phone, invading privacy) is questionable. \n\nWait, he found the condoms in her purse when he was looking for Advil. That's a privacy invasion. That's a problem. Even if he's suspicious, going through her belongings without asking is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, his actions in invading her privacy might have led him to the condoms, which he interpreted as cheating. But his initial behavior (checking her phone movements, suspicion without evidence) is controlling. \n\nSo, if he's acting controlling and then reacts harshly when she explains a serious issue, he's partly at fault. However, if she's lying about rape to avoid consequences, that's a separate issue. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is making assumptions without evidence. He's taking her actions (which could have innocent explanations) as signs of cheating. Then, when confronted, she says she's being raped. He doesn't believe her and kicks her out. \n\nIf she's telling the truth, then he's wrong for not believing her. But if she's lying, he's right. However, the way he approached the situation (privacy invasion, not allowing her to explain calmly) is problematic. \n\nIn terms of the question, is he in the wrong? If the scenario is that he's making accusations without evidence and invading her privacy, then yes, he's in the wrong. But the fact that she claims a rape complicates it. However, if the rape claim is a fabrication, then he's right. \n\nBut from an outsider perspective, it's hard to say. However, in relationships, if someone accuses their partner of cheating and then the partner claims a serious issue like rape, the appropriate response would be to support and verify, not to immediately end the relationship. \n\nSo, the author's actions (invading privacy, not giving her a chance to explain, assuming the worst) are wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
