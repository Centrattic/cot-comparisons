Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about his girlfriend's behavior leading him to suspect she's being raped, but he found condoms and other suspicious actions. He confronted her, she said she was being raped, he kicked her out. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a relationship and noticed red flags: her acting strangely around her phone, dressing up unusually, and finding condoms. These behaviors could be concerning. But when he confronted her, she claimed she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, feeling betrayed, but later questions if he was wrong to not believe her.\n\nOn one hand, believing someone who says they're being raped is important. It's a serious accusation, and false accusations are rare. But on the other hand, the author had reasons to be suspicious based on her actions. However, he didn't give her a chance to fully explain before reacting. He grabbed the box, went to the bathroom, and then kicked her out. Maybe he didn't handle the situation carefully enough.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's explanation was that she was being raped, which is a severe claim. The author's initial reaction was anger and not believing her, which could be a problem. The fact that she was crying and felt he didn't care might indicate that his response was harsh. Even if he had doubts, he should have listened more before making a decision to end the relationship. \n\nAlso, the presence of condoms doesn't necessarily mean cheating or consent. It could be for protection in a non-consensual situation, but that's complicated. The author's assumption that it was for mutual use without asking her properly might be hasty. He didn't give her the benefit of the doubt, which is necessary in such sensitive issues.\n\nIn terms of trust and communication, the author might have breached trust by looking through her purse. However, he mentioned he never looked in her phone or was nosy, but finding the condoms in her purse might be considered a privacy issue. Still, the way he handled the confrontation was confrontational.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a duty to believe her claim of rape. If she genuinely was being raped, not believing her could be wrong. But if she was lying, then he might be justified. However, without more evidence, it's hard to say. The author's judgment is clouded by his suspicion of infidelity, leading him to dismiss her serious claim without thorough consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's immediate reaction to kick her out without a proper discussion might be the issue. He should have tried to understand her side better before making a decision. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with empathy and openness.\n"
