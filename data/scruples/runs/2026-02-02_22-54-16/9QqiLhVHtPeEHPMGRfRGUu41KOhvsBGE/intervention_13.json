Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was talking to someone named Rick. The author noticed some behaviors that made him suspicious\u2014like her acting strangely when looking for her phone, getting dressed up fancy even though she usually isn't, and tilting her phone away. Then he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse (which he can't fit, so implies they're for someone else). When confronted, she said she was being raped, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe author is conflicted because on one hand, he wants an explanation, but on the other, he's worried it's just more lies. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the answer. They need a response of A or B.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the red flags the author noticed and how he handled the confrontation. The author's actions based on those red flags\u2014like finding the condoms\u2014led him to suspect cheating. However, when GF claims she was being raped, he reacts with anger and disbelief, which is problematic. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, if someone discloses being a victim of rape, the immediate reaction should be support, not accusations. Even if there are suspicions, the way he responded\u2014accusing her of lying, not believing her\u2014could be seen as invalidating her trauma. That's a big issue. But the user is saying he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the GF's story is conflicting. She's getting dressed up and has condoms, which is odd if she's being raped. That inconsistency might make the author's doubt reasonable. However, the author's response was to kick her out instead of discussing it. So, it's a mix of both: the author might have had valid concerns, but his reaction was unkind and unsupportive if she was indeed being raped. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit usually looks at whether the person is being unreasonable, especially in how they handle the situation. The author didn't go to the police or support her, which is the standard response when someone is a victim. Instead, he immediately assumed she was lying and ended the relationship. That's a problem. But the GF's story also doesn't add up, so maybe the author's doubt is justified? \n\nBut the main issue here is the response to the rape claim. Even if there are inconsistencies, the author's reaction is harsh. So, if she was actually being raped, he's in the wrong. If she wasn't, maybe he's not. But the story is conflicting. The author's heart shattered, he was angry, and reacted in a way that could be seen as not supportive. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often values support and communication. The author's immediate reaction to kick her out without support or trying to understand is likely the wrong move. However, if there were genuine red flags and the GF's story is conflicting, it's a complex situation. \n\nBut the GF's explanation being \"it could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can't leave\" is a bit of a stretch. That might indicate she's not in a healthy situation, but the presence of condoms is confusing. Maybe she's being pressuring into non-consensual sex but still has protection? Not sure. \n\nThe author's problem is he didn't support her. The community might see him as the asshole for not believing her and reacting with anger, even if he had doubts. But the GF's story is inconsistent, which complicates it. \n\nSo, the answer is tricky. The author's actions were harsh, but maybe he's not in the wrong if her story is a lie. However, from an ethical standpoint, even if there's doubt, the way he reacted is not supportive. The community often sides with the person who is more supportive. So, maybe AITA is the author. But I need to check the nuances again. \n\nThe author found the condoms, which is a red flag. GF says she was being raped, but that's not adding up. The author could be in a situation where he's trying to protect himself from betrayal but mishandled it. Alternatively, if she was actually being raped, his response is wrong. \n\nSince the story is conflicting, the answer might depend on the community's view of the response to a rape claim versus the red flags. AITA usually considers the balance between both parties' actions. The author's immediate judgment and reaction without support is likely the issue here. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respond appropriately to her claim of rape, even if he doubted it.\n"
