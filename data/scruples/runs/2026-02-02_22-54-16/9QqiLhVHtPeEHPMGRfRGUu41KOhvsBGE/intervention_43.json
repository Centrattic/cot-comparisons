Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend noticed some red flags: her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms. Then, when confronted, she claims she was being raped. The boyfriend is confused because the circumstances don't seem to align with being a victim\u2014he's questioning how someone in a real rape situation would dress up and have condoms. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend's observations led him to find the condoms, which he didn't use. That's a big red flag. But on the other hand, when she says she's being raped, he has to take that seriously. However, the boyfriend is right to be suspicious because the behavior doesn't fit typical patterns of someone in an abusive situation. People in abusive relationships might dress up to look presentable to others, not necessarily because they're planning something with the abuser. Also, the presence of condoms is odd if the relationship is non-consensual. \n\nBut here's the thing: the boyfriend didn't confront her directly. He found the condoms by accident. Maybe he should have approached the situation differently. Instead of immediately reacting with anger and breaking up, he might have tried to talk to her more calmly. But she provided an explanation that didn't make sense to him. However, it's possible she was lying for some reason, like to get out of seeing him or due to another issue.\n\nLegally and ethically, accusing someone of lying about rape is a huge deal. But the boyfriend isn't the one making the official accusation; he's just skeptical given the context. The problem is that he kicked her out, which might have been harsh, but if she was actually being raped, cutting off contact could be dangerous. However, if she was lying, he's protecting himself from potential betrayal.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's skepticism is based on observable discrepancies. While he should have handled it more carefully, his conclusion that she might not be telling the truth isn't necessarily wrong given the facts he has. The key points are the inconsistent behavior and the condoms. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he should have handled it more thoughtfully.\n"
