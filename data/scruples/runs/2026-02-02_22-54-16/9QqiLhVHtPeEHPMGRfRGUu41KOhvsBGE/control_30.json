Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who the author accuses of cheating, leading to a breakup where the author kicks her out. The girlfriend claims she was being raped, which adds a layer of complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed some red flags like secretive behavior, sudden changes in appearance, and found condoms. He confronted her and she responded with a claim of being raped. The author then ends the relationship, feeling betrayed and confused.\n\nNow, legal and ethical perspectives are important here. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, that's a serious crime, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her trauma. However, the author's actions\u2014like going through her purse and confronting her\u2014might be seen as invasive and not the best approach. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author acted inconsiderately without sufficient evidence. The girlfriend's explanation that she was being raped is a heavy claim, and the author's immediate assumption of cheating without listening might be the problem. Also, the author's method of confrontation (finding the condoms himself) could be seen as a breach of trust and privacy, which might have contributed to the situation.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people are often judged on their actions and how they handle conflicts. The author's lack of trust and invasion of privacy might be seen as his fault, especially if he didn't give her a chance to explain before taking drastic actions. Additionally, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious matter that the author seems to have dismissed, which could make his reaction seem harsh and insensitive.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and trust. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
