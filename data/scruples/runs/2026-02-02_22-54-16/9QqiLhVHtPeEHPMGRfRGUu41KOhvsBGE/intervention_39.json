Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and reacting with anger, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author thought his girlfriend was cheating because she was acting suspiciously\u2014like searching for her phone frantically, dressing up unusually, and tilting the phone away. Then, when he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she claimed she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's unsure if he was wrong to do so.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and how he handled the situation. When he found the condoms, he immediately assumed she was cheating because of the brand (Magnum, which he can't fit). However, she told him it was for a rape situation, which is a serious accusation. His reaction was to kick her out and cut off contact, which might be seen as harsh if her claim was true. But there's a conflict here because if she was actually being raped, why was she dressing up and acting suspicious? Also, she hadn't mentioned any prior issues, so it's out of character.\n\nBut the problem is that the author's actions were based on his assumption without hearing her side. However, she provided a very serious explanation that could make him question his trust. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If he didn't trust her and acted on his suspicions without verifying, that's on him. But if she was lying about being raped, that's a different scenario. However, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is lying. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction to kick her out after a breakdown where she said she was getting raped is questionable. Even if he was suspicious, the response might be too severe without more evidence. But if he felt that her behavior was inconsistent with her story (dressing up, having condoms but saying it's non-consensual), that could make him think she's lying. However, people in abusive situations might act differently than expected, so his judgment might be flawed.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's about whether the author is the one at fault. The answer depends on whether he had a right to make that assumption and react so harshly. The fact that she claimed to be raped complicates things. If her claim is true, he's wrong to doubt her and react so strongly. If she's lying, he's justified. But without knowing the truth, the community often looks at how the situation was handled. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust, but he also had reasons to be suspicious. However, the correct approach would be to listen and seek more information instead of immediately breaking up. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it with care, especially if her claim was genuine. Alternatively, if her story doesn't add up, maybe he's not. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the girlfriend. The answer is probably B (No), but I need to check the details again. The user thinks the author is not wrong, so I should consider that. The author's trust was broken, but his reaction might be too extreme. However, if he felt betrayed and couldn't trust her, maybe he's justified. The community usually sides with the person who didn't act violently or without understanding. Since he reacted strongly without fully processing her explanation, maybe he's the asshole. But the situation is complex. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because he acted on his feelings of betrayal, even though handling it better would have been ideal. But AITA often considers if the person was wrong to react that way. Alternatively, if her claim of rape is true, then the author is at fault for doubting her. But the question is about the author's actions. Hmm. The answer here is B, but I need to make sure.\n"
