Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend was acting suspiciously, like hiding her phone, dressing up, and having condoms in her purse. When he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she said she was being raped. He kicked her out and now is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's actions are based on observing red flags. He noticed her behavior changes and the presence of condoms, which he interpreted as cheating. When she claimed she was being raped, he was skeptical. Now, the key points to consider here: \n\n1. **Trust and Communication:** In a relationship, trust is crucial. If there's a lack of communication and the partner is acting secretive, that can lead to misunderstandings. The author was concerned and tried to address it, but the girlfriend didn't provide clear explanations until she mentioned being raped.\n\n2. **Credibility of the Claim:** The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious allegation. The author's reaction was to question her credibility, especially since her actions (getting dressed up, having condoms) didn't align with the claim. However, the author might not fully understand the complexities of someone being in an abusive situation. Sometimes, victims might engage in behaviors that seem contradictory, like dressing up for a date with an abuser, due to manipulation or control.\n\n3. **Emotional Response:** The author felt humiliated and angry, which is a natural reaction to betrayal. However, his response was to kick her out without seeking more information. The girlfriend felt that her revelation of being raped was damaging, and the author didn't validate her feelings initially.\n\n4. **Context and Past Behavior:** The author mentions that this was out of character for her. If she has no history of such behavior, it might mean that the situation is different now. However, if she's in an abusive situation, her behavior might be forced or manipulated by the abuser.\n\n5. **Need for Verification:** The author might not have all the facts. The girlfriend could be in a real abusive situation, and the author's reaction could have been too hasty. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is lying about being raped as a cover for cheating, the author's skepticism is warranted.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations:** Accusing someone of being an abuser is serious, but so is accusing someone of lying about a rape charge. The author's right to question his partner's actions is balanced against the need to support her if she's a victim.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is that he didn't get the full story before reacting. He might have acted out of hurt and anger rather than seeking to understand. However, his initial suspicion was based on observable behaviors. The problem is that he dismissed her claim of rape without giving her a chance to explain further, which could be problematic if she truly is a victim. But if she's lying, then he's justified. The question is whether his response was appropriate given the lack of clear evidence either way.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction might stem from a place of hurt and mistrust, but his immediate dismissal of her rape claim without a more thorough investigation could be seen as problematic. However, given the conflicting evidence, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The answer hinges on whether his reaction was a justified response to potential infidelity or an unjustified dismissal of a serious accusation.\n"
