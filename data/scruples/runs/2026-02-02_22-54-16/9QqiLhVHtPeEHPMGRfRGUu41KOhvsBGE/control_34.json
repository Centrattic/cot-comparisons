Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend was acting suspiciously. She was hiding her phone, dressing up a lot, and there were condoms in her purse. He found them and confronted her. She claimed she was being raped. The author found her explanation conflicting because of her behavior and the condoms.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author's actions in confronting her after finding the condoms. He was angry and kicked her out. But she claims she was being raped. The author is now questioning if he was wrong to not believe her.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. The author had reasons to be suspicious based on her behavior. However, when she claims she was being raped, that's a serious allegation. The author reacted emotionally, which is understandable, but maybe he should have listened more before reacting. \n\nBut wait, the author might have had valid concerns. If someone is cheating, that's a betrayal. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. The author might be in a tough spot because he's not sure if she's lying or telling the truth.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The author's main mistake was not handling the situation calmly. Instead of listening to her explanation, he immediately kicked her out and was angry. If she was genuinely being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive. But if she was lying, his reaction is justified.\n\nHowever, without more context, the author's initial reaction might be hasty. He should have given her a chance to explain properly before taking action. Also, assuming she was lying without evidence could be wrong. The girlfriend's behavior might have other explanations, but the author didn't consider that. \n\nBut the presence of condoms and her behavior does raise red flags. The author might not be wrong if he has good reason to believe she was cheating. However, the way he handled it\u2014without fully understanding her side\u2014could be where he's at fault. \n\nIn terms of legal or moral rightness, the author isn't in the wrong for suspecting infidelity, but he might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and openness to her explanation. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious matter, and the author's reaction might be seen as not taking her seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong if the girlfriend was actually cheating, but the way he handled it could be seen as the problem. However, since the user is asking if he's the asshole, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had reasons to be suspicious and his reaction was based on his perception. But if he dismissed a genuine accusation of rape, that's a problem. However, the girlfriend's behavior contradicts her claim, so maybe the author isn't the asshole. It's a tricky situation.\n"
