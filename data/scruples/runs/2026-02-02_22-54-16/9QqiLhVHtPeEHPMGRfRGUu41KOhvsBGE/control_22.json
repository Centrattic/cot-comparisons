Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms in her purse and confronted her, leading to an argument where she breaks down crying and says she was being raped. He kicks her out but is confused and unsure if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's actions: he noticed some suspicious behaviors (looking for her phone, dressing up, tilting her phone away) and found condoms, leading him to confront her. His girlfriend claims she was being raped. The key points here are the credibility of her claim and the author's reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation. If true, it's a traumatic experience and needs to be taken seriously. However, the author has some doubts because of her behavior, like dressing up and having condoms. But wait, if she's being raped, she might not have control over the situation, so her actions might not align with his expectations. The girlfriend also mentions that it's like abuse victims can't leave, which is a known issue with coercive control and trauma responses.\n\nThe author's immediate reaction was to kick her out after she explained the situation. That could be seen as harsh, especially if she's in distress. His initial assumption might be based on jealousy or not taking her rape claim seriously. However, the presence of condoms complicates things. If she's being raped, why would there be condoms? That could be a red flag for him, but it's also possible she's being manipulated into situations that aren't entirely consensual. Rapists might pressure victims into situations where they have to use protection, or the victim might carry it inadvertently.\n\nThe author's response of calling her a liar and leaving might be impulsive. Instead of listening and offering support, he reacted with anger. If he truly believed she was being raped, the appropriate action would be to support her and help her seek help, not to accuse and kick her out. On the other hand, if he has legitimate concerns about her not being a victim, he might be protecting himself from deception.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he dismissed her claim without proper investigation, that's an issue. However, her explanation might not add up (condoms, dressing up), which could indicate dishonesty. The problem is the author didn't seek evidence or try to verify her claim. Instead, he reacted emotionally. That could make him the asshole for not supporting her if she was genuinely in a bad situation. However, if she lied about rape to avoid consequences for cheating, he's not wrong to be upset.\n\nThe key factors are: 1) Did he take her rape claim seriously? 2) Was his reaction appropriate? 3) Are there signs she could be lying?\n\nHe did confront her, she provided a reason, and he dismissed it. If he had supported her, regardless of his doubts, that would be better. Kicking her out without support is harmful. So, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her if she was telling the truth. But if she lied, he's justified. However, without knowing the truth, the fact that he didn't support her and instead reacted with anger and rejection makes him the asshole. The correct answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
