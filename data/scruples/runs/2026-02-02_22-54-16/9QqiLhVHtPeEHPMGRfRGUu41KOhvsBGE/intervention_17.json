Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's claim that she was being raped. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the user describes his girlfriend's behavior as suspicious. She was acting strangely, like looking for her phone frantically, dressing up more than usual, and then he found a box of condoms in her purse. He felt hurt and then when she said she was being raped, he reacted angrily and ended the relationship. Now he's wondering if he was wrong for not believing her.\n\nOn one hand, if someone is being raped, that's a serious crime, and not believing them could be harmful. But on the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior seems inconsistent with a rape scenario. The presence of condoms, the way she was dressed, and her delayed response to the situation might make someone question the validity of her claim. But how does one balance the need to believe survivors with the possibility that the situation might not be as it seems?\n\nThe author here didn't confront her in a supportive way. Instead, he found the condoms, got angry, and reacted by kicking her out. That reaction might be too harsh, especially if she was indeed telling the truth. But the problem is, if she was lying, then his reaction is understandable. The challenge here is that the story is one-sided. We don't know the full truth\u2014maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the condoms and her behavior that isn't cheating or rape. \n\nBut the key point is, how should one respond when presented with an accusation of rape? Society often encourages people to believe survivors, but that doesn't mean every claim is true. However, the way the author handled it\u2014immediately doubting her, being confrontational, and ending the relationship without trying to understand\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Even if he thought she was lying, the approach might not have been appropriate. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's claim of being \"raped\" in this context is confusing. The presence of condoms suggests consent, but maybe there's more to the story. She could have been in a coercive situation where she felt forced to have sex despite using protection. But the author didn't give her a chance to explain, he just reacted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's immediate reaction of disbelief and anger might be seen as wrong because it's possible she was actually in a difficult situation. However, his doubts were based on suspicious behavior. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for doubting her. The answer depends on whether the situation is a case of genuine rape or not. Since we don't have that information, it's hard to say, but typically, in such scenarios, the default is to side with believing the survivor unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. The author didn't do that; he immediately dismissed her claim without giving her a chance to explain. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for his reaction, even if his suspicions were valid. His response was harsh and unkind, which could be seen as the problem here.\n"
