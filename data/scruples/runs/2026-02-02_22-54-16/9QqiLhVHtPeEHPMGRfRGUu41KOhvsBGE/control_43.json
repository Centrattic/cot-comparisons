Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend being accused of cheating, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse. He thought she was cheating, but she claimed she was being raped. The key here is how he reacted. He confronted her when he found the condoms, and she responded with the rape claim. The author then kicked her out, not believing her explanation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the facts. The girlfriend's behavior was unusual: hiding her phone, dressing up, etc. But when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author didn't believe her, leading to the breakup. \n\nBut the problem is, the author made assumptions without evidence. He jumped to conclusions about cheating instead of considering her possible trauma. If she was indeed being raped, his immediate reaction could have exacerbated her trauma. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly, instead acting on his suspicion. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have been dishonest. However, the author's actions were based on suspicion without verifying the truth. In situations involving potential trauma or serious claims like rape, the appropriate response is to support the person rather than confront them aggressively. \n\nThe author's reaction might have been too harsh. Even if he felt betrayed, his approach could have been more supportive, especially if her claim was true. It's possible she was in a situation where she couldn't leave, and his response made things worse. \n\nBut if she was lying about being raped to avoid consequences for cheating, then the author's reaction is more understandable. However, without knowing the truth, we have to evaluate based on actions. The author didn't seek evidence or support for her claim, instead choosing to end the relationship immediately. \n\nIn terms of handling a serious accusation like rape, the correct approach is to believe the person and offer support, not to accuse them of lying. Even if there are doubts, the priority should be to ensure the person's safety and well-being. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions of confronting her in a hostile manner and not believing her claim could be seen as the wrong approach, regardless of whether she was telling the truth. He didn't handle it with the gravity it deserves.\n"
