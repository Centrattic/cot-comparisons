Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user is a guy whose girlfriend, let's call her GF, was acting suspiciously. He noticed her being secretive, acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, and then he found a box of condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's actions: he noticed red flags, found the condoms, confronted her, and she responded with the rape claim. His reaction was to end the relationship. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for not believing her and ending it.\n\nOn one hand, if someone is being raped, that's a serious matter. But the author is skeptical because her behavior contradicts her claim. Dressing up, having condoms, and acting secretive might not align with a non-consensual situation. Also, the fact that she said it's a \"side effect\" like people who can't leave abuse\u2014that might not fully explain the actions. \n\nBut then, the author's approach was to confront her by finding the condoms and then reacting strongly. He didn't give her a chance to explain further, just kicked her out. Also, he might have acted out of jealousy or mistrust, which could be problematic. However, his suspicion was based on observed behaviors that are inconsistent with her claim. \n\nThe issue here is about trust and how to handle accusations. If she was indeed being raped, his response could be dismissive or harmful. But if she lied about the rape to cover up cheating, then his reaction was based on valid concerns. The problem is we don't know the truth. The author is caught between his instincts and her claim. \n\nAnother angle: the author's initial assumption that she was cheating, then her counter-accusation of rape. The fact that he felt the need to confront her with the condoms might have been too harsh without a proper discussion. Also, he admits he's not the size for the condom brand, which adds to his suspicion. \n\nBut is it fair to kick her out without hearing her out? The author might have acted impulsively. However, given the inconsistencies in her story, his skepticism isn't entirely unfounded. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, if the author dismissed a genuine rape claim, he's in the wrong. But if she lied, then he's justified. The question is whether his actions were appropriate regardless of the truth. Since we can't know the truth, we have to evaluate based on the information given. \n\nThe author's actions included invading her privacy (checking her purse), which might be a breach of trust. But he felt justified due to the red flags. The key is whether his reaction was proportionate. Kicking her out after a confrontation where she claims rape is a heavy response, but maybe he felt it was necessary given the situation. \n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether his skepticism is valid. The story is presented as the author feeling wronged because her story doesn't add up, but the platform (like Reddit's AITA) often leans towards considering both sides. However, given that she accused rape, which is a severe allegation, the author's response might be seen as harsh, especially if he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. But the inconsistencies in her behavior might support his doubts. \n\nSo, considering all, the answer is probably that he's not in the wrong (B) because his actions were based on observed inconsistencies and he ended the relationship when trust was broken. But there's a nuance here because the rape accusation is serious. However, since the story is from his perspective and the details are what they are, the answer is B."
