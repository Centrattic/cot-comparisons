Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The key points here are the author's actions and the girlfriend's response.\n\nFirst, the author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms in her purse. Based on these, he assumed she was cheating. Then, when confronted, she said she was being raped, which the author found hard to believe because of the inconsistencies (like the fancy clothes and condoms). He then kicked her out, leading to her feeling hurt and discarded.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and emotional aspects. The author's initial suspicion might be based on valid observations, but his reaction was to accuse and then confront her in a way that led to a breakdown. However, when she claimed she was being raped, that's a serious allegation. The author dismissed her claim without giving her a proper chance to explain, which is problematic. Rape is a severe issue, and even if the author didn't believe her, he should have handled the situation with more care. Kicking her out after such a claim could be seen as not supporting her, especially if she was in distress. \n\nBut then there's the other side: the girlfriend's behavior was uncharacteristic and the condoms might suggest consensual activity. However, her claim of being raped needs to be taken seriously. The author's reaction might have been hasty and based on assumptions rather than facts. The fact that she said it's a \"side effect\" like abuse victims can't leave might indicate she's in a difficult situation, which the author didn't address properly. \n\nLegally and ethically, if someone claims they're being raped, the appropriate response isn't to assume they're lying but to seek support or report it. The author's reaction might have been harsh and not supportive, which is a problem. On the other hand, he was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable. \n\nBut the key point is that the author dismissed her serious allegation without investigation. Even if he later realized his mistake, his immediate reaction was to reject her, which could be seen as wrong. So, is he in the wrong? Probably yes, because he didn't handle the situation with the gravity it deserved, especially after the rape claim.\n"
