Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. She then said she was being raped. The author is now questioning if he was wrong to think she wasn't actually being raped and to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors\u2014like her acting frantic when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms. He confronted her, and she responded with the rape claim. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, if the girlfriend was indeed being raped, then the author's doubt could be dismissive of her trauma. On the other hand, the author might have had reasons to be suspicious given the behaviors.\n\nBut the key here is that the girlfriend made a serious accusation of rape. Even if there were red flags, the author should have listened more carefully instead of immediately doubting her. Trust and belief in a partner's claims, especially regarding non-consensual acts, are crucial. The author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and not being open to an explanation\u2014could be seen as not supporting her if she was genuinely in a difficult situation. \n\nHowever, the situation is complicated. The author might have felt betrayed, but the way he handled it could be problematic. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and not being able to leave is a serious issue. If the author dismissed her without giving her a chance to explain further, he might be at fault for not believing her, even if there were inconsistencies. \n\nBut then again, if the author had valid reasons to be suspicious (like the condoms and her behavior), it's a tough spot. However, when dealing with claims of non-consensual acts, the appropriate response is usually to support the person and encourage them to seek help, not to question their reality. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably made a mistake by not believing her claim of rape. Even if he had doubts, the right approach would be to take the claim seriously and help her get the necessary support rather than ending the relationship abruptly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
