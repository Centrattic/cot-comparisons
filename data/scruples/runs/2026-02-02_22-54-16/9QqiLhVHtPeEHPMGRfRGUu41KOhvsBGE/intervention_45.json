Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend, who he suspects is cheating because of some behaviors like hiding her phone, dressing up, and finding condoms in her purse. She claims she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. The question is whether he's wrong for not believing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author describes red flags and suspicious behavior. Finding condoms that don't fit him is a big clue. But when confronted, she accuses him of not caring because she was a victim of rape. The author then kicks her out. \n\nOn one hand, rape is a serious issue, and the author's reaction might seem harsh. But on the other hand, if she was indeed involved in consensual activities, then her claim of rape is false, which is a crime. The author had reasons to be suspicious based on her behavior. \n\nBut the problem here is that he didn't give her a chance to explain further. When she said she was being raped, he immediately reacted without seeking more information. However, if her story didn't add up\u2014like being dressed up and having condoms\u2014it's reasonable for him to be skeptical. \n\nBut then again, how would he know? He's not in her mind. The issue is that he assumed she was lying without verifying the facts. However, he's in a position where he can't verify the truth, and his instincts told him something was off. \n\nThe key points: He had evidence of suspicious behavior. She made a serious accusation. He reacted emotionally, but his reaction might be justified if he felt lied to. However, he didn't take time to listen to her explanation properly. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the question is whether his actions were justified. If she was lying about rape to cover cheating, then the author might be in the right to break up. But if she was genuinely a victim, then his reaction was wrong. However, the story doesn't provide evidence that she was actually being raped. \n\nSo, the answer likely depends on whether the author had other reasons to be skeptical, and if his actions were a reasonable response to a potential lie. Since the user says the author is not in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as not wrong because he had suspicions and found evidence (condoms) that led him to question her. His breaking up might be a reaction to betrayal. However, not believing her claim of rape without evidence could be problematic. But the user's question is if he's in the wrong. Given the conflicting sides, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had reasons to be skeptical, and the story doesn't confirm her rape claim.\n"
