Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is questioning if they're an asshole (AITA) for not believing their girlfriend's claim that she was being raped by someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was acting suspiciously\u2014hiding her phone, dressing up unusually, and the author found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author reacted by kicking her out, feeling betrayed and not believing her story. The girlfriend claims it's a \"side effect like those people who are abused and can't leave,\" which sounds like a reference to trauma responses where victims might stay in abusive situations.\n\nThe author is conflicted: part of them wants to hear her explanation, but they're also convinced she's lying. The question is whether the author is wrong for not believing her. \n\nIn real-life scenarios, it's crucial to approach such claims with sensitivity. Even if the situation seems suspicious, dismissing someone's report of being raped can be harmful. Rape is a serious crime, and survivors often face disbelief or blame. However, there are red flags here\u2014like the condoms and the behavior changes\u2014that might indicate deceit. But the author's immediate reaction was to accuse her of cheating rather than support her, which is problematic. \n\nLegally and ethically, it's wrong to accuse someone of a crime without evidence, but the author isn't doing that here; they're questioning their partner's honesty. The issue is more about trust and communication. The girlfriend's story doesn't add up from the author's perspective, but he also didn't give her a chance to explain properly. \n\nHowever, the author's response of kicking her out without a proper discussion might be hasty. They should have tried to understand her side first. But if they truly believed she was lying, their reaction is based on distrust. The problem here is the assumption of dishonesty without giving her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their confusion and not believing a story that seems inconsistent. However, their response could be seen as harsh, but given the context, maybe they felt justified. The answer depends on whether not believing a partner's claim of rape makes one an asshole. \n\nI think the key point is that the author didn't validate her feelings and immediately assumed the worst. But if they had no reason to believe she was being raped and the evidence points otherwise, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for their reaction. However, the way they handled it could be better. But based on the scenario, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is justified in being skeptical given the inconsistencies.\n"
