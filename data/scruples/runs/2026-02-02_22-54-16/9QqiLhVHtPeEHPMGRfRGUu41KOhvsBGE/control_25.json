Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. He found a box of condoms in her purse, and she reacted emotionally, saying she was being raped. He broke up with her, and now he's unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author mentions several red flags he observed: his girlfriend acting suspiciously when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing her claim of rape.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, accusing someone of cheating without evidence can be problematic. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious. If she was being raped, that's a severe issue, and the author should take it seriously. But the situation is complicated because the evidence (condoms, her behavior) led him to suspect infidelity, while her explanation is a serious allegation.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out immediately. He might be in a dilemma between his suspicions and her claim. However, he didn't give her a chance to explain further. If she genuinely was being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive or not supporting her. On the other hand, if she was lying, he might have been protecting himself from betrayal.\n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend's claim of rape is a heavy accusation. If the author doesn't believe her, that could be a problem, especially if she was telling the truth. However, the situation is not clear-cut. The author might have had reasons to be suspicious based on the evidence he found. But how should he handle it? Confronting her directly and then breaking up without giving her a chance to explain further could be hasty.\n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses being a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to listen, support, and encourage them to seek help. If the author didn't believe her, that could be a failure to support her if she was indeed a victim. However, the girlfriend's behavior and the presence of condoms might have led him to doubt her claim. But that raises the question: can someone's behavior after being raped be different? Maybe she was trying to protect herself, or maybe the situation is more complicated.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend said it was a side effect like those who can't leave an abusive situation. That could imply she's in a non-consensual relationship but can't leave. However, the presence of condoms might conflict with that, unless she's using them for protection against STIs in an abusive relationship. That's a possibility, but the author might not have considered that angle.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he might have acted impulsively. Breaking up immediately without a thorough discussion could be seen as harsh. However, given the emotional impact of finding condoms and her accusation, he might feel justified. But he also needs to consider if there's another explanation for the condoms, like for protection in a non-consensual situation.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's disbelief in her claim of rape makes him an asshole. If she was genuinely being raped, then his not supporting her would be wrong. However, if her behavior and the evidence (condoms) led him to suspect deception, he might have been protecting himself. But without knowing the full truth, it's hard to say.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's important to believe victims of assault, but also to recognize that people's situations can be complex. The author's immediate reaction might be seen as not supporting her if she was telling the truth. However, if she was lying, his reaction could be justified. The problem is the lack of clear evidence on both sides.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if his response was to not believe her serious allegation without giving her a chance to explain properly. He could have handled it by encouraging her to seek help or by supporting her if she was a victim, instead of immediately breaking up. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But there's also a case for B if he had a right to be suspicious. However, the severity of her accusation (rape) should be taken seriously regardless of his suspicions. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
