Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who accuses his girlfriend of cheating but she claims she was being raped. \n\nFirst, the author noticed some behaviors that he found suspicious: she was acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up fancy, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms in her purse. He confronted her, and she said she was being raped. He kicked her out, saying he didn't believe her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is making assumptions based on his observations. He found condoms, which he interpreted as evidence of cheating. However, the girlfriend claims it's about being a victim of rape. The author is now doubting her explanation.\n\nBut wait, if someone is being raped, would they have condoms on hand? That doesn't make sense. Rape is non-consensual, so the presence of condoms might be a red flag for the author, but maybe there's another explanation. Maybe she's preparing for something else? Or maybe the story is more complex. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior being \"out of character\" doesn't necessarily mean she's lying. Sometimes people act differently when they're in distress. Also, the fact that she immediately broke down crying and the situation was called \"damaging\" suggests it's a serious accusation.\n\nBut the author's approach is problematic. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly before reacting. He found the condoms and made a hasty judgment. His reaction of kicking her out and not giving her space to explain could be harsh, especially if she's genuinely in a vulnerable state. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a position where trust is important. If he has consistent red flags and a situation where she's involved with another man, he's justified in being concerned. But he should verify the facts before jumping to conclusions. \n\nThe problem here is the author's immediate assumption without evidence. The girlfriend is making a serious claim that needs to be taken seriously. Dismissing her claim without a proper investigation or support is not appropriate. Rape is a grave accusation, and if she's telling the truth, the author's reaction is cruel. But if she's lying, then the author is being paranoid. \n\nBut the key here is how he handled it. Instead of listening and seeking evidence, he accused her and cut her off. That's not a healthy way to resolve conflicts. Trust should be a two-way street, and he's failing to communicate properly. Also, the presence of condoms doesn't prove cheating. Maybe she's in a situation where she needs them for protection, even if it's non-consensual. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with care, made assumptions without evidence, and reacted in a way that could be hurtful if the girlfriend's story was true. He should have supported her and helped her seek help if the rape claim was real, instead of doubting her.\n"
