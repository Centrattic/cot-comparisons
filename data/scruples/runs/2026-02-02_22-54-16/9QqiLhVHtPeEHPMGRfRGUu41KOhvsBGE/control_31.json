Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's in a relationship with his girlfriend, starts suspecting she's cheating because of some behaviors. He finds condoms in her purse, which leads to an argument where she claims she was being raped. He kicks her out, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author noticed some red flags: her acting nervously around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and the condoms. Then when he confronts her after finding the condoms, she says she was being raped. He doesn't believe her and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and how he handled the situation. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If someone is cheating, it's a major breach of trust. However, the girlfriend claims she was being raped. That's a serious allegation. But the author is questioning the validity of that claim because of the context\u2014dressing up, having condoms, her behavior. \n\nBut wait, if someone is being raped, why would she have condoms? That could be a red flag, but maybe there's another explanation. For example, maybe she was trying to protect herself in a situation where she felt forced. However, the author immediately dismisses her claim, calling her out for lying. But if she's being raped, that's a serious issue, and he should have believed her first. \n\nThe problem here is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He just assumed she was cheating and reacted by ending the relationship. If she was actually in danger, his reaction could be seen as dismissive and not supportive. On the other hand, if she was lying about being raped to cover up cheating, then he's protecting himself from betrayal.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of the rape claim, if it's true, then he's wrong to not support her. If it's a lie, then he's justified. However, we don't have evidence on which side is right. The author is in a position where he found evidence that could point to cheating but is told a story that's very serious. \n\nIn such a scenario, the general advice would be to approach the situation with empathy and try to understand rather than immediately accuse and end things. Even if there are doubts, the appropriate step might be to talk through it, seek counseling, or gather more information. Kicking her out immediately without a proper discussion might be seen as hasty. \n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's reaction of saying he doesn't care is because she felt he dismissed her trauma. If she was genuinely in a situation where she felt violated, his immediate anger and disbelief could be hurtful. However, if she was lying, then his reaction is understandable. \n\nBut without knowing the truth, we have to consider the ethical standpoint. The author's actions might be seen as a failure to believe someone who claims to be a victim of a serious crime, which is a problem. However, he also has the right to question inconsistencies. \n\nIn many cases, the default is to believe a person when they say they're being raped, because of the severity and the underreporting of such crimes. So if the author didn't believe her without sufficient reason, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut the presence of the condoms and other behaviors might lead someone to doubt. The key here is that the author didn't give her a proper chance to explain. He made an immediate judgment. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) or A (Yes, he is)? Wait, the options are A for yes (he is wrong) and B for no. \n\nIf the author didn't believe her and ended the relationship based on his immediate reaction, not considering her explanation, then he might be in the wrong. Because even if he's suspicious, the appropriate step is to listen, support, and investigate further. Dismissing a rape claim is a serious issue. So the answer could be A (he is in the wrong). But if the author's actions were self-protective and he's just sharing his perspective, maybe B.\n\nBut in the scenario, the author is asking if he's the asshole, and the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key is that he didn't believe her when she said she was being raped. If that's the case, then he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
