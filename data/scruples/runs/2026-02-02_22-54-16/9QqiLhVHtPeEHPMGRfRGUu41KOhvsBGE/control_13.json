Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, finding condoms, and then she claims she was being raped. The author kicked her out and is now questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: her acting frantic when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she claims she was being raped. The author's reaction was to kick her out, feeling betrayed and angry. She later says it's because she was a victim of rape.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, if the girlfriend was actually being raped, the author's initial assumption of her cheating would be wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author didn't have concrete evidence of cheating. His actions (looking through her purse) might be seen as invasive, though he says he wasn't nosy. Finding the condoms led him to his conclusion. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is serious. If true, the author's immediate reaction of not believing her and ending the relationship could be harmful. But if her story is a lie to cover up cheating, then the author's actions make sense.\n\nBut how do we determine if the author is in the wrong? In a relationship, trust is crucial. The author's behavior (checking her phone, being suspicious) might indicate a lack of trust, which can be an issue. However, he had reasons to be concerned given the red flags. The problem is that without evidence, his assumptions led to a harsh reaction. Also, if she was indeed a victim of rape, his response was dismissive, which is not supportive. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her behavior not aligning with being a rape victim. Dressing up, having condoms, and acting in a way that might suggest consent could be confusing. However, rape is not about consent from the victim; it's about the perpetrator's actions. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and unable to leave might be valid. The author's refusal to believe her could be the issue here.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he didn't give her a chance to explain beyond the initial denial. He took her at face value when she said she was being raped but didn't pursue the explanation. Yet, his reaction was to end the relationship immediately, which might be seen as harsh if her claim was genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, if she was lying about the rape to cover cheating, then the author was right to leave. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since there's no definitive proof either way, it's a judgment call. However, in situations where someone discloses a trauma like rape, the appropriate response is to believe and support them, not to immediately sever the relationship without further discussion. The author's lack of willingness to listen might make him the asshole, especially if her story was true. However, if he had good reason to doubt her, then maybe not. \n\nGiven the information, the author is in a tough spot, but his immediate reaction without seeking more information and his initial assumption of cheating could be seen as the wrong move, especially if the girlfriend was truthful about being raped. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't support her and acted on assumptions without evidence. But there's also the possibility that he's not wrong if she was lying. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and without knowing the truth, the immediate judgment is that he didn't handle it well. So, probably A.\n"
