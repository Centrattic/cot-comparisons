Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong in a situation where they thought their girlfriend was cheating, but she claimed she was being raped. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author noticed several red flags: the girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and there were condoms in her purse. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and ended the relationship, hence the \"AITA\" question.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the author's reaction and judgment. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On the surface, if someone is being raped, that's a serious accusation. However, the author points out inconsistencies: why would a rape victim dress up and have condoms available? Also, the girlfriend didn't mention this before, and it seems out of character.\n\nBut I should consider the sensitivity of the situation. Accusations of rape are extremely serious, and even if the author is skeptical, it's important to approach such claims with care. The author's immediate dismissal without seeking verification might be problematic. However, the red flags are real, and the girlfriend's behavior did seem inconsistent with being a victim of non-consensual sex.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014confronting her, reacting with anger and disbelief\u2014are typical of someone hurt and confused. But is that the right way to handle it? The girlfriend might have felt too ashamed to speak up earlier, or maybe she's lying. The author's takeaway is to not trust her and end the relationship.\n\nI need to balance the possibility that the girlfriend is genuinely a victim (though the details don't add up) with the author's right to be concerned about their partner's potential betrayal. The key is whether the author was justified in their reaction given the lack of clear evidence. Since the girlfriend didn't provide a satisfactory explanation, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their observations and the inconsistencies in her story.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), because the author had legitimate reasons to be suspicious given the behavior, and while it's important to be sensitive, the situation as described shows inconsistencies that led to their decision. The author isn't necessarily at fault for acting on their observations and not believing a conflicting story.\n"
