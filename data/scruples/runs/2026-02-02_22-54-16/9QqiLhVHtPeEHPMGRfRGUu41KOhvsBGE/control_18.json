Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. But then she told him she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author noticed some red flags: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up when she usually doesn't, and there were condoms in her purse. Based on these observations, he made an assumption that she was cheating. But when confronted, she said she was being raped. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't have concrete evidence of cheating, just suspicions based on behavior that could be explained in other ways. The girlfriend's explanation, while unexpected, is a serious one. However, the author didn't take the time to listen to her explanation fully or consider that there might be another reason for the behavior. He made an assumption based on the condoms and her actions, then reacted by kicking her out without verifying her claim.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's story that she was being raped is also problematic. If she was being raped, she would need support, not accusations. However, the fact that she was wearing fancy clothes and had condoms might not align with that scenario. But that's not necessarily the case\u2014maybe she was trying to fit in or the situation was complicated. The author's immediate reaction was to accuse her of cheating without giving her a chance to explain properly.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author's actions\u2014finding the condoms and then reacting without fully understanding the context\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust based on his own assumptions. Even if he felt suspicious, the appropriate response might have been to talk to her calmly and listen to her side before making accusations. By doing so, he might have avoided the situation where he's now questioning his own actions.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior was indeed strange, and the condoms were a significant red flag. The author's reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling betrayed. But the key point here is whether he was wrong in not believing her claim. If she truly was being raped, then his reaction of not supporting her could be seen as wrong. But if she was lying, then his response, while harsh, might be justified.\n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend's explanation seems inconsistent. If she was being raped, why would she be dressing up and using condoms? That doesn't make sense unless there's more to the story. The author's intuition that something was off might be valid. However, the way he handled it\u2014accusing her of cheating immediately without giving her a chance to explain\u2014might be where he's wrong. He should have asked for an explanation first rather than assuming the worst.\n\nAlso, the author's initial assumption that the condoms were for cheating (based on the magnum brand) shows a lack of consideration for other possibilities. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious one, and even if it's not true, the author's reaction of not believing her and cutting her off might be inconsiderate. However, given the inconsistency in her story, the author might have a valid reason to be skeptical.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not giving his girlfriend a proper chance to explain her situation fully and for reacting with anger and disbelief. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have given him reason to be suspicious. The key issue is the lack of open communication and the immediate assumption of infidelity without seeking understanding. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
