Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suspecting their girlfriend of cheating but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms in her purse, noticed her acting strangely around Rick, and now they've broken up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a man in a relationship with a girlfriend. He starts noticing behaviors that he finds suspicious: her frantic phone searching, acting distracted, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms in her purse. When he confronts her, she says she's being raped, not that she's cheating. He reacts by breaking up with her.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a confirmation. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions\u2014like finding the condoms and suspecting infidelity\u2014are based on his observations. But when confronted, the girlfriend claims she's being raped. That's a serious accusation. However, the author's reaction is to break up without digging deeper into her explanation. \n\nBut there's a problem here. If she's being raped, that's a criminal matter. The author didn't report it to authorities, just kicked her out. Also, the girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, having condoms, acting secretive) might not align with a non-consensual situation. Typically, in cases of rape, the survivor might not have control over such items or behaviors. However, the scenario is complicated because the girlfriend is the one providing the account.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately. He didn't give her the benefit of the doubt after her serious accusation. Instead of listening, he dismissed her explanation and ended the relationship, which could be seen as not supporting her. On the other hand, his suspicions might be valid if the story doesn't add up. But he didn't take the appropriate steps, like involving authorities, which is crucial if someone is indeed being raped.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for not trusting her explanation. If he immediately believed it was cheating without verifying, he might be wrong. However, the way he reacted\u2014breaking up without trying to understand her side more deeply\u2014could be seen as not being supportive, especially if she was in a vulnerable position. Also, the fact that she said it's a \"side effect like those people who can't leave\" suggests a pattern of abuse, which the author didn't address properly. \n\nIn the context of the AITA format, people usually consider intentions and actions. The author's actions led to the breakup without proper resolution. The girlfriend's claim is serious and should be taken seriously, but the author didn't handle it correctly. He should have possibly involved professionals instead of making a judgment call based on his suspicion. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't take the appropriate steps when his girlfriend made a serious accusation. However, there's also the angle that if the girlfriend was lying, the author might be justified. But given that the user is asking for an answer, and considering the typical AITA responses, the community often sides with the person who listens and tries to resolve issues rather than making snap judgments. Therefore, the author might be seen as the asshole for not supporting his girlfriend if she was telling the truth, or for not properly investigating if she was lying. It's a tough call, but the immediate breakup without further discussion leans towards him being in the wrong.\n"
