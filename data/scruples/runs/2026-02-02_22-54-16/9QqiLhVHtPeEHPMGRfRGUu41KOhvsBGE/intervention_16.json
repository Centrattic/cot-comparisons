Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy notices some suspicious behaviors\u2014like her searching for her phone nervously, dressing up unusually, and the condom brand. Then he finds condoms when looking for Advil. She says she's being raped, but he doesn't believe her and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, accusing someone of lying about a serious issue like rape is a big deal. But the author had specific reasons for his suspicion. The key here is whether his doubts were justified. He points out inconsistencies, like her being dressed up and having condoms, which could indicate consent rather than forced sex. However, it's important to note that rape is a serious crime, and the person reporting it should be believed first, unless there's clear evidence of a lie. \n\nBut the author's actions\u2014kicking her out after a confrontation\u2014might be seen as harsh. However, he felt betrayed and hurt. The problem is, the girlfriend's explanation was vague. If she was truly being raped, the presence of condoms and her behavior doesn't necessarily contradict that. Maybe the rapist is pressuring her to use them, or she's in a situation where she's being manipulated. The author's not there to know the full context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's immediate reaction of disbelief could be harmful. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and if there's no prior history of dishonesty, his instincts might be wrong. But the red flags he mentions (like the phone searching, avoiding looking at her phone) could be signs of infidelity too. The condoms being Magnum, which he can't use, might indicate another person is involved. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of \"it could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can't leave\" is a bit of a generalization and might not be a solid explanation. However, that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. The author's reaction of not wanting to hear more might be because he's hurt and doesn't trust her explanation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he doesn't believe her and ends the relationship, but there's no proof either way, it's a tough call. The general advice is to believe survivors of assault, but the author has valid doubts. However, he should consider if he's jumping to conclusions without enough evidence. The answer might depend on cultural and personal beliefs about trust and accountability in relationships.\n\nGiven all that, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he acted on his suspicions and couldn't confirm the truth, leading to a breakup. However, ideally, he should have sought more information before reacting so harshly. But given the scenario, his actions are a result of hurt and confusion, not malice.\n"
