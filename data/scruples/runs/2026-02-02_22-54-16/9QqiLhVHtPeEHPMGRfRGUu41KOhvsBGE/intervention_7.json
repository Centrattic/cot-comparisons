Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is the boyfriend finding condoms in his girlfriend's purse and reacting by breaking up, leading her to claim she was being raped.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend noticed several red flags: her acting strangely around the phone, getting dressed up unusually, and the condom box. He acted on finding the condoms, which led to the confrontation. His reaction was immediate and strong, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend then says she was being raped, which the boyfriend found hard to believe given the context of her behavior.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's perspective, he found what he considered evidence of infidelity. His reaction was based on that evidence, even if it might not be the full story. But when she claims she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. The problem here is the lack of communication. The boyfriend didn't confront her about the red flags first; instead, he discovered the condoms and reacted without discussing the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim of being raped raises questions. If she was in a non-consensual situation, she might have sought help or told someone else. The fact that she was getting dressed up and had condoms could be part of a forced situation, maybe she was trying to look presentable despite being coerced. However, the boyfriend's assumptions based on the condoms and her behavior might be jumping to conclusions without understanding the full context.\n\nBut from the boyfriend's standpoint, he found evidence that he interpreted as cheating, and when confronted, she provided a story that he found hard to believe. His decision to break up was based on his perception of betrayal, but he might have been too quick to judge without giving her a chance to explain properly. However, the girlfriend's actions did seem suspicious, and the situation is complicated by her sudden claim of rape, which could be a separate issue.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The boyfriend's lack of trust led him to act impulsively. The girlfriend's behavior was out of character, which he noticed and reacted to. But when she made the rape claim, that's a serious situation that might require belief and support, even if the circumstances seem conflicting. The boyfriend dismissed her claim as a lie, which could be hurtful and invalidating if there was any truth to it. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for being suspicious and reacting to what he found. It's a tough situation where both parties have valid points but failed to communicate effectively. The boyfriend's actions were driven by his perception of betrayal, but the girlfriend's claim of rape complicates things. The answer depends on whether the boyfriend's immediate reaction and assumption of cheating were justified without more context, and whether dismissing her rape claim was incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend might not be entirely in the wrong for acting on the evidence he found, but he could have handled the situation better by discussing the red flags first. The girlfriend's claim of rape adds another layer, and his reaction might have been too harsh given the serious nature of her accusation. However, the situation is complex, and both have points that need consideration.\n"
