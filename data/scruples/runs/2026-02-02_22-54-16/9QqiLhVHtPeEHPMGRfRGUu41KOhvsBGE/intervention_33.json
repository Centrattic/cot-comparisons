Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse, which he interprets as evidence of cheating. However, the girlfriend claims she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. The author then kicks her out, and now he's questioning whether he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed several red flags: her frantic phone searches, dressing up unusually, avoiding looking at her phone when together, and the condoms. When confronted, she claims she's being raped. The author doesn't believe her and ends the relationship.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider the ethical implications here. The author's actions are based on his interpretation of evidence. However, there's a real possibility that the girlfriend might be in danger if she's being raped. The author's response\u2014kicking her out and cutting off communication\u2014could prevent her from getting help. On the other hand, if she's lying, the author is protecting himself from potential betrayal.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't verify her claim. Instead, he immediately dismissed her explanation without giving her a chance to provide more information. Even if he was suspicious, the correct approach might have been to support her and help her seek help, rather than ending the relationship abruptly. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious allegation that requires a careful and supportive response, not immediate judgment.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial assumption that the condoms were for cheating is based on the brand (Magnum), which he can't use. However, there are other possible explanations for having Magnum condoms, like they were given to her or for a friend. The author didn't consider these possibilities and jumped to conclusions.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior, such as dressing up and avoiding looking at her phone, could be explained by other reasons as well. The fact that she was crying and froze when confronted might indicate genuine distress, which the author didn't acknowledge.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author should have prioritized her safety and well-being. Even if he was in a position where he felt betrayed, the appropriate step would be to offer support and encourage her to seek help if she was being raped. By cutting her off, he might have left her in a dangerous situation. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he was hurt and wants to avoid further lies. There's a balance between protecting oneself and ensuring the well-being of the other person. The key issue here is that the author made a judgment without sufficient evidence and failed to consider the possibility that his girlfriend might be in real danger.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as dismissing a serious claim without due consideration. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he didn't take the situation seriously enough to ensure his girlfriend's safety, even if his suspicions were valid.\n"
