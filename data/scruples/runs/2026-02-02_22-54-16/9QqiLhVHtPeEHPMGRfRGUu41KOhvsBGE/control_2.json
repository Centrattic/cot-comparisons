Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not believing his girlfriend's claim of being raped when he found condoms in her purse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend had been acting strangely: hiding her phone, getting dressed up in a way that's out of character, and then the condoms were found. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author felt she was lying and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key here is understanding the context. If the girlfriend was being raped, those behaviors might make sense. For example, she might be trying to keep her phone hidden if she's in a dangerous situation. Dressed up could be for situations she's forced into. But the author is skeptical because of the condoms and the fact that she didn't act in a way he expected from someone being raped.\n\nBut wait, shouldn't the author believe his girlfriend if she says she's being raped? That's a critical point. In many cases, survivors of trauma or assault might not act in ways that others expect. Their behavior can be confusing or inconsistent due to the trauma. However, the author didn't give her a chance to fully explain, just reacted with anger and disbelief.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a right to be concerned if there were red flags. But the main issue is the immediate assumption of lying rather than seeking the truth. Confronting her with the condoms and not believing her could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction was to cry and say he didn't care, which suggests she felt betrayed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not believing her. Without more information, it's hard to say, but generally, in such situations, trust and belief in the survivor are important. The author's response was harsh and based on suspicion without giving her the opportunity to explain, which might be where he's in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
