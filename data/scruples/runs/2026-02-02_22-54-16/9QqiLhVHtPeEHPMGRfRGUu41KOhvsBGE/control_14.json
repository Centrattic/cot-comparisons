Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has been acting suspiciously. She's been secretive with her phone, dressing up more than usual, and there's a box of condoms found in her purse. The author immediately jumps to the conclusion that she's cheating, which leads him to confront her. She then claims she's being raped, which he reacts very harshly to, even kicking her out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a presumption of infidelity without any concrete evidence, and then reacted violently when she provided an alternative explanation. Now, the girlfriend says she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. But there's a contradiction here: if she's being raped, why is she dressing up, having condoms, and acting secretive? These are red flags, but maybe there's another explanation.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014checking her phone, invading her privacy by looking in her purse, and then reacting with anger and betrayal\u2014might be problematic. Trust in a relationship is important, but so is giving the benefit of the doubt. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious matter. If true, the author's response could be seen as dismissive or even harmful. But if the rape claim is a cover for infidelity, then the author's suspicion might be justified.\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain fully. He immediately kicked her out without understanding the context. Also, his reaction to her explanation was to call her a liar and end the relationship. The girlfriend might be in a vulnerable position if she's actually being assaulted, and his response might prevent her from seeking help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had reasons to be concerned. The behavior was out of character, and finding condoms that don't fit him is a strong indicator. However, jumping to conclusions without evidence and then reacting with anger could be unwise. He might have handled it better by approaching her calmly and seeking clarification rather than making assumptions.\n\nBut the bigger issue is the girlfriend's claim of being raped. If that's true, the author should support her, not accuse her of cheating. However, if it's a lie to cover up cheating, then the author was right to be suspicious. The problem is there's no evidence presented here to confirm either side's story.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. He acted on suspicion without proof, invaded her privacy, and then reacted harshly to her explanation. That's problematic. But if the rape claim is genuine, then his response is even worse. However, the story doesn't provide enough info to confirm her claim. The author is in a tough spot, but his actions\u2014especially the immediate judgment and lack of support\u2014could be seen as wrong. He didn't handle it with empathy or give her space to explain properly. So, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't give her the benefit of the doubt and reacted poorly without sufficient evidence.\n"
