Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (a guy) found out his girlfriend was in a relationship with someone else, maybe cheating. He found condoms in her purse, saw her acting suspiciously around her phone, and she claimed she was being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend said she was being raped, but the author thinks that's not true because she was getting dressed up, had condoms, and so on. The author then kicked her out. The question is whether the author is wrong for not believing her.\n\nHmm. The key point here is that the girlfriend made a serious accusation\u2014being raped\u2014which is a very serious matter. The author didn't take her seriously and instead reacted by ending the relationship. But is he wrong for doubting her?\n\nWell, if she actually was being raped, not believing her would be a huge problem. However, the situation is complicated because there were signs that might suggest she was lying. Like the condoms being Magnum size, which the author can't use, and her acting suspicious. But even so, it's possible she was in an abusive situation where she couldn't leave, as she mentioned. \n\nBut then again, if she was being raped, why would she have condoms in her purse? That seems contradictory. Unless she was trying to protect herself, but that's a stretch. Also, dressing up might not be a sign of non-consensual activity. Maybe she was trying to look nice for a date with Rick, which could be cheating but not rape. \n\nThe author's response was to confront her and then kick her out. He didn't give her a chance to explain further, which might be hasty. However, if he believed she was lying about being raped to cover up cheating, that's a different angle. But if she was telling the truth about being raped, then the author's reaction might be dismissive of a serious issue.\n\nBut how do we weigh this? In real life, it's important to believe survivors of sexual assault. However, if there are inconsistencies in her story, should the author be blamed for not believing her? Or is it possible that she was in an abusive situation where she couldn't leave, and the author's reaction was too quick?\n\nThe problem here is that we don't know the full truth. The author is in a position of trust; if he was in a committed relationship and found out his partner was in a relationship with someone else, he might see it as cheating. But if she was actually being forced, then he was wrong to not take her seriously. \n\nBut the way she reacted\u2014freezing, crying, saying she couldn't leave\u2014could be part of a manipulation tactic. It's possible she was in an abusive situation, but the signs (condoms, dressing up) might make it hard to believe. However, it's also possible that she was lying. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction was anger and ending the relationship, which could be seen as not giving her the benefit of the doubt. But if he believed she was lying, maybe he's justified. However, if she was telling the truth about being raped, then the author's reaction is part of the problem.\n\nBut in reality, when someone says they are being raped, you should believe them first and not immediately jump to conclusions of lying. However, the author had some red flags. But maybe he should have handled it differently, like supporting her if she was in danger rather than just cutting her off.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't believe her when she said she was being raped, that's wrong. But if she was lying, then he's justified. But since we don't know the truth, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in cases like this, society generally advises trusting the person when they make a serious accusation unless there's overwhelming evidence otherwise. The author's reaction might be seen as not supporting her and being dismissive, which could be wrong. But if he had reason to think she was lying, maybe not. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or societal norms about believing survivors. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and if the community's response typically would be that you shouldn't question someone's claim of being raped, then he's in the wrong. But if there are clear contradictions, maybe not. But the key point is that he didn't give her a chance to explain further and ended the relationship immediately. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often are judged for not supporting or believing a partner's serious claim. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't take her seriously when she said she was being raped. However, there's the aspect of the condoms and her actions suggesting otherwise. But in real life, you don't get to question the validity of a rape claim based on your own assumptions. So the answer is likely A.\n"
