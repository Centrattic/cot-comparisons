Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author found condoms in their girlfriend's purse and, based on various red flags, assumed she was cheating. But she claimed she was being raped. The author then kicked her out.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had red flags and found condoms, which could be a sign of infidelity. But then, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped. That's a serious accusation. So, how does that play into the situation?\n\nThe key here is the author's assumption. They jumped to the conclusion of cheating without verifying the truth. The girlfriend's claim of being a rape victim is a critical point. If she was actually being raped, then the author's reaction of kicking her out might be harsh and insensitive. However, if her story is a lie, then the author might be justified in ending the relationship.\n\nBut what do we know? The author found the condoms and saw the red flags. The girlfriend's explanation was that she was being raped. But the author found it hard to believe because of the other behaviors\u2014like getting dolled up and having condoms. Rape isn't about the victim's appearance or their willingness; it's about non-consensual acts. So maybe the author is making a mistake by not believing her. But how do you verify that?\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out, which is a major decision. The girlfriend said the author didn't care, but the author is torn between wanting to believe her and thinking it might be a lie.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted without fully understanding the situation, maybe they are at fault for not giving her a chance to explain properly. But if the author's instincts were correct and she was lying, then maybe the author is right. However, making such a judgment based on assumptions can be problematic, especially when it's about a serious issue like rape.\n\nRape is a non-consensual act, and the victim's behavior doesn't define the situation. The author's assumption that because she had condoms and was dressed up, the rape claim is invalid, might be flawed. The author could be in the wrong for not believing her report of a serious crime, even if it's unverified.\n\nBut the author also had reasons to suspect infidelity. It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were dismissive of a potential serious issue versus acting on their own mistrust.\n\nIn the end, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were in a confusing, emotionally charged situation. However, the way they reacted (kicking her out without a full discussion) might not be the best approach. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best action. The key point is whether the author's assumptions and immediate reaction were justified.\n"
