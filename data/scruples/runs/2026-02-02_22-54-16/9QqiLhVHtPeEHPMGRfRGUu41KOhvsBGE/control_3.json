Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend named Rick, or someone else, and the author's suspicions leading to a breakup. \n\nFirst, the author noticed some behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then finding a box of Magnum condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped, which the author found hard to believe given the context of the condoms and her behavior.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and reactions. He found the condoms and immediately assumed she was cheating, leading to an argument where she claims she was being raped. The author then kicked her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's initial suspicion and reaction might be questionable. He didn't give her a chance to explain the presence of the condoms before reacting. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped raises significant concerns. If she was indeed being raped, then the author's immediate judgment and reaction could be seen as dismissive of her trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was lying about the rape to justify cheating, then the author's distrust might be a result of her suspicious behavior. But the author's assumption that she was cheating without giving her a chance to explain, and then not believing her when she made a serious claim, could be seen as him not taking her seriously. \n\nThe author's actions, like searching her purse and confronting her with the condoms, could be seen as invasive, even if done in a moment of suspicion. However, the girlfriend's sudden change in behavior and the presence of condoms might have justified some level of concern. \n\nThe critical factor here is the girlfriend's claim of rape. If that's true, the author's reaction was inappropriate. If it's a lie, then his suspicion might have been warranted. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the way the author reacted\u2014immediately not believing her and cutting off communication\u2014could be seen as a failure to support her if she was genuinely in distress. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses a serious issue like rape, the immediate reaction should be to believe and support them, even if there's suspicion. The author's reaction might have been a betrayal of that trust. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't give her the benefit of the doubt when she made a serious claim."
