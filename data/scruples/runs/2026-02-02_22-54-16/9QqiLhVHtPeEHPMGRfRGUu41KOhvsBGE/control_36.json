Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend was talking to someone named Rick. The author noticed some red flags: she was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse. He assumed she was cheating, confronted her, she said she was being raped, and he kicked her out. Now he's conflicted about whether he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he went through her purse without asking, found the condoms, and made assumptions. Even though Magnum condoms are a specific brand, that's still pretty judgmental and invasive. He didn't talk to her about his concerns first, which could have been a better approach. Instead, he jumped to conclusions and reacted impulsively by kicking her out.\n\nWhen she said she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. The author dismissed it by saying he didn't believe her, which is a big problem. Even if he had reasons to be suspicious, he should have listened to her explanation before reacting. His comment about her being \"damaging\" to herself if she revealed that is also concerning. He then kicked her out, which could leave her in a vulnerable situation, especially if she was actually being raped.\n\nBut wait, she did say she wasn't cheating, but instead was being raped. The author's immediate reaction was disbelief and anger, which might not be appropriate. If she was indeed being raped, his response could be harmful. However, the author might be right if she was lying about the rape to justify cheating. But how can he know without proper investigation?\n\nThe key here is the lack of communication. The author didn't address his concerns calmly. Instead, he acted out of anger and suspicion. Even if he's right about her cheating, his method of handling it was poor. Also, the context of her saying she was being raped needs to be taken seriously. If it's true, his reaction could be a betrayal. If it's false, it's still a manipulative lie. Either way, the way he handled it is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author may not be entirely in the wrong, but he definitely made mistakes in how he approached the situation. However, the fact that he didn't believe her when she said she was being raped and reacted so harshly could be a problem. On the other hand, if she was lying, then he might be justified. But since we don't have all the facts, it's hard to say. However, the way he handled it is a red flag. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't give her a chance to explain, invaded her privacy, and his reaction was harsh without proper context."
