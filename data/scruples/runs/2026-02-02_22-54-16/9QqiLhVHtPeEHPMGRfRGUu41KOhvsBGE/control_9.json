Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating, and she responds by saying she was being raped. The author then kicks her out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author's reaction was to kick her out, not believing her explanation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Assuming Cheating Without Evidence**: The author jumps to the conclusion that his girlfriend is cheating based on circumstantial evidence. While the red flags are there, he doesn't have direct proof. Condoms can be for various reasons, and dressing up doesn't necessarily mean cheating. But his immediate assumption could be problematic. However, it's also understandable for someone in a relationship to be suspicious when they notice such behaviors.\n\n2. **Reaction to Her Claim**: When the girlfriend says she's being raped, the author reacts with anger and disbelief. This is a serious accusation. If she was indeed being raped, his immediate reaction could be seen as dismissive. However, his skepticism is based on inconsistencies he perceives between her actions and her claim (dressing up, having condoms). But the girlfriend's explanation was that she couldn't leave due to being abused. It's possible that in abusive situations, victims might not act in ways that seem obvious to outsiders.\n\n3. **Communication and Trust**: The author found the condoms and confronted her, which led to the argument. The key issue here is how he handled the confrontation. Accusing her directly of cheating without proof, then reacting harshly when she brings up a serious allegation like rape could be seen as the wrong approach. However, if he had evidence of her cheating, that would be different. Without that, his immediate conclusion and reaction might be hasty.\n\n4. **Potential for Misunderstanding**: The girlfriend's behavior could have multiple explanations. The author's assumption might be based on his own insecurities or misunderstandings. However, the presence of condoms and her odd behavior might have given him reason to be concerned, even if it wasn't cheating.\n\n5. **Rape Allegation and Belief**: The author didn't believe her claim, which is a significant issue. If she was indeed being raped, not believing her could be a serious mistake. However, if her story didn't hold up (like the inconsistencies he points out), his doubt might be justified. But it's a delicate balance because victims of abuse might not act in ways society expects.\n\n6. **Breaking Up**: The author kicked her out after the confrontation. Whether this is wrong depends on the validity of his accusations. If he's right, he's protecting himself from cheating. If she's a victim, he's cutting her off when she needs support.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral perspectives, if the girlfriend was being raped, the author's reaction is problematic because he didn't support her. But if she was lying about the rape to deflect from cheating, then his action is justified. The problem is the lack of evidence on both sides.\n\nThe key here is that the author made an assumption and acted on it without sufficient proof, especially when the girlfriend made a serious counter-accusation. The fact that her behavior was \"out of character\" adds complexity. However, the author's immediate conclusion and reaction, especially after the rape claim, could be seen as dismissive and not supportive, which would be wrong. Alternatively, if her claims were lies, he's the one wronged.\n\nBut in situations involving serious allegations like rape, the default should be to believe the person making the claim, especially if there's no concrete evidence to the contrary. The author's reaction of anger and disbelief when she claims to be a victim of rape is likely the mistake here. Even if there were inconsistencies, it's possible she's in an abusive situation and is acting in ways that don't make sense to an outsider. Therefore, the author's failure to support her and instead cutting her off might be the wrong approach."
