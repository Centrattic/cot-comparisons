Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is the boyfriend who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she claimed she was being raped. The question is about determining if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The boyfriend noticed several red flags: her frantic phone searches, sudden interest in dressing up, tilting her phone away, and then finding the condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. He reacted by kicking her out, feeling betrayed and angry. She later claims this was out of character and she's \"damaged.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I have to consider both sides. The boyfriend's reaction is based on suspicion and his instincts. However, he didn't give her a chance to explain before reacting. On the other hand, her explanation of being raped seems inconsistent with her behavior (dressing up, having condoms, not reporting it to authorities). \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's approach was to immediately confront her, leading to her emotional breakdown. He didn't seek to understand or offer support. Instead, he accused her of lying and ended the relationship. This might suggest a lack of trust and empathy. However, her story seems suspicious, so his doubt is somewhat justified. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend overreacted without proper investigation. He found evidence (condoms) that conflicted with her claim. But he could have handled it differently\u2014maybe by asking for more details or encouraging her to involve authorities. By not doing so, he might have dismissed her potential distress, but his actions were based on skepticism. \n\nIt's a tough call. On one hand, he's reacting to what he perceives as lies. On the other, his response was harsh and didn't allow for her explanation. The answer hinges on whether his trust was reasonable to be broken given the inconsistencies.\n"
