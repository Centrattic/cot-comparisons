Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author, a guy in a relationship, noticed some red flags with his girlfriend, like her acting suspiciously when using her phone and dressing up unusually. Then he found a box of condoms in her purse, which led to a big argument where she claimed she was being raped. The author is now questioning if he was wrong in his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with possible infidelity, which is a serious issue. He found the condoms and reacted emotionally. But when she said she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. The author might have doubted her because of the context\u2014like why she was dressed up and had condoms if it was non-consensual. However, accusing someone of cheating or not believing them if they say they're a victim of sexual assault is a sensitive issue.\n\nOn one hand, if she was actually being raped, the author not believing her could be a problem. But on the other hand, if she was lying, then his reaction might be justified. The key points here are whether the author's doubts were reasonable given the circumstances and if he overreacted by breaking up with her immediately.\n\nThe author's actions: He kicked her out and told her not to speak to him anymore. That's a severe reaction. But given the shock and betrayal, maybe it's understandable. However, the way he reacted without hearing her out might be an issue. But she provided an explanation (she was being raped), which he didn't accept. The problem is that the author's skepticism led him to break up, possibly without giving her a chance to explain further.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If someone accuses you of an infidelity, and then says they're a victim of rape, it's a conflicting scenario. The author's confusion is natural. However, not believing someone's claim of sexual assault is a serious matter. However, in this case, the girlfriend's behavior before the accusation might have given the author reason to be suspicious. But when she made the rape claim, that's a red flag. The author's reaction might be seen as not taking her seriously if she was truly in danger. However, if she was lying, then the author is justified.\n\nBut the problem is that the author might have misinterpreted her situation. If she was being coerced or manipulated, maybe the fancy dresses and condoms were part of an abusive situation. The author's immediate dismissal of her claim could be harmful if her accusation was genuine. But if she was lying, then he's not the asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author's initial skepticism was reasonable. He had noticed red flags and found the condoms, which led to his suspicion. When she accused her of rape, he was confused and angry. The key is that accusing someone of rape is a heavy claim, and the author's reaction of breaking up might have been too harsh. However, if he believes she's lying, then maybe he's justified.\n\nBut the issue is that the author didn't give her a proper chance to explain her side. He immediately reacted with anger and broke up. That's a big deal. If she was in a real situation, his reaction could have pushed her away from getting help. But if she was lying, then he's not wrong.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's disbelief was reasonable. Since the girlfriend's behavior was unusual, but the rape claim is a serious accusation, the author's reaction might be seen as not taking her seriously. However, the situation is complex.\n\nConsidering all, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he had reasons to doubt, but maybe he should have approached it more carefully. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author's reaction was to break up based on conflicting information, but the girlfriend made a rape claim which is a serious issue, the author's disbelief could be seen as not taking her seriously. However, if the author had no prior knowledge of abuse, maybe his reaction is understandable. The answer might be B (no) because the situation is ambiguous and the author acted based on his suspicions, though he might have overreacted.\n"
