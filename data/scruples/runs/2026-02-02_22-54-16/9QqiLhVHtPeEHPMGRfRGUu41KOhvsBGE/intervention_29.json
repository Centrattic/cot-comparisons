Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's claim of being raped. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend was acting suspiciously\u2014hiding her phone, dressing up fancy, etc. Then he found condoms in her purse, which led to an argument where she claimed she was being raped. The author feels conflicted because the circumstances don't align with his understanding of non-consensual situations.\n\nSo, the key points here are the red flags he noticed and his reaction when confronted. The author is questioning her credibility because of the context\u2014like the fancy outfits and condoms. But wait, even if someone is dressed up, it doesn't mean they're not being coerced. Maybe the rapist forced her to dress nicely. And the condoms could be for protection if she's being forced into sex. Those are valid points from her side, but the author is skeptical.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, if someone claims they're being raped, the immediate response should be to believe them and offer support, not to question their credibility. However, the author here had prior observations that made him suspicious. But even with those observations, the right approach would be to listen and seek to understand, maybe get professional help, rather than confront her with anger and kick her out. \n\nBut the author is confused because the context doesn't fit his expectations. He might be in a position where he's trying to protect himself after feeling betrayed. However, if she was actually being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive and harmful. On the other hand, if she was lying, his suspicion might be justified, but his method of dealing with it was harsh.\n\nThe dilemma here is between trusting a partner's claim of a serious crime versus the observed suspicious behavior. The author's actions could be seen as not supporting her, which is crucial in such situations. Even if there's doubt, the proper response is to offer support and seek help, not to confront in a confrontational manner. So, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her and acting on his suspicions without understanding the full context.\n"
