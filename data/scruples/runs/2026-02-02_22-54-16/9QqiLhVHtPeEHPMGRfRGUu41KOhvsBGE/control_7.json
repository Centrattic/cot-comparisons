Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's accusing his girlfriend of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. He found condoms in her purse, and she was acting suspiciously. But he kicked her out after she said she was being raped. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014acting strangely, hiding her phone, dressing up a lot for friends, etc.\u2014could be red flags for cheating, but they could also be explained by other things. Then there's the condoms. He assumed they were for cheating, but she said it was for rape. That's a huge claim. \n\nNow, the key point here is the girlfriend's claim of being raped. If someone says they're being raped, that's a serious accusation. The author is supposed to believe them unless there's clear evidence otherwise. But he immediately jumped to the conclusion that she was cheating, didn't listen to her explanation, and kicked her out. \n\nBut wait, she said she was being raped, so why would she have condoms? That seems contradictory. If she was being forced, wouldn't the condom be used by someone else? Maybe she had them for protection if she was being forced. Or maybe she was trying to document the abuse, like some victims do. But the author didn't take her explanation seriously. Instead, he was angry and didn't give her a chance to explain properly. \n\nAlso, when she said she was being raped, he called her out for not acting like a victim (dressing up, having condoms). That's a big problem. People's reactions to trauma can vary. Some might dress up as a way to feel in control, or the rapist might have forced her to dress a certain way. Condoms might be there for any number of reasons, not just cheating. Maybe she was trying to prevent pregnancy if she was in a situation where she couldn't say no. \n\nSo the author's mistake was not believing her claim of rape without evidence. Assuming she was lying about a rape is a serious issue. Even if his suspicions about cheating were valid, he should have approached the situation with more empathy and given her a chance to explain the rape claim. Instead, he dismissed her, which is why he's in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, is there any evidence that she was actually being raped? The story doesn't say. She could be lying. But in cases of rape, the responsibility is on the accuser to provide evidence, not on the accused to prove their innocence. The author didn't support her and instead reacted with anger, which is wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend's claim of rape and reacted in a way that dismissed her traumatic experience.\n"
