Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who found out that his girlfriend had a box of condoms, which he immediately assumed she was cheating with another guy named Rick. He noticed some red flags like her being secretive about her phone, dressing up fancy, and not listening when she was around him. Then, when he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she admitted she was being raped. He kicked her out, thinking she was lying. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The main issue is the author's assumption that his girlfriend was cheating, leading him to act confrontationally. When confronted, she claims it's about being raped, but he didn't believe her. The question is whether his actions and assumptions were wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he noticed behaviors that he found suspicious. Maybe he's justifiably concerned about potential infidelity. But when she brings up being raped, he dismisses her. That could be a problem. But wait, she said she was being raped by someone else, so why would she have condoms? If she's being forced, she wouldn't need or use them. The author's confusion here makes sense because if someone is in a non-consensual situation, they wouldn't be preparing for it with condoms. But the girlfriend's explanation that it's a side effect of abuse where she can't leave might not hold up. People in abusive situations often do whatever they can to survive, not engage in anything that requires consent.\n\nBut how did the author respond? When she told him she was being raped, he called her out as a liar and kicked her out. That's a harsh reaction. Even if he was skeptical, immediately doubting her claim of being a rape victim is problematic. Rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it without evidence could be seen as harmful. Also, if she was in an abusive situation, cutting off her support system (the author) could be dangerous.\n\nHowever, the author found physical evidence (condoms) which he interpreted as proof of cheating. His initial assumption might have been incorrect, but he had a reason to be suspicious. The key here is how he handled the confrontation. If he had believed her, even with the condoms, maybe she could have explained more. But he didn't. Instead, he reacted with anger and disbelief, which is where he might be wrong. The girlfriend's claim of being raped might not be credible given the context, but the author's response was to accuse her rather than listen. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's explanation that she was being raped is conflicting with the evidence. The author has a right to be upset if he was lied to. But the way he handled it, especially if she was actually in danger, might be where he's at fault. However, the story doesn't confirm if she actually was being raped. If she was lying about the rape, then the author's actions make sense. But if she was telling the truth, then he's at fault for not believing her. Since the story is from his perspective and he's unsure, it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nBut generally, in situations where someone claims to be a victim of a crime, especially a serious one like rape, the onus is on the person to believe the victim unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. However, the author found a box of condoms, which is concrete evidence. The girlfriend's explanation seems contradictory. The author might not be in the wrong for not believing a story that doesn't fit with the evidence. But the way he reacted, like immediately kicking her out and calling her out, might be where he's wrong. He should have given her a chance to explain before reacting so harshly.\n\nSo, in the end, the author might not be in the wrong because he had a reason to be suspicious, but his reaction was harsh. However, the girlfriend's claim doesn't hold up with the evidence. The problem is that the story is from his perspective, and we don't know the full truth. If she was lying, he's justified. If she was truthful, he's not. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because he acted on the evidence he had, even if his reaction could have been better. But the core issue is his assumption and the immediate conclusion without seeking more information. However, the girlfriend's explanation is contradictory, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
