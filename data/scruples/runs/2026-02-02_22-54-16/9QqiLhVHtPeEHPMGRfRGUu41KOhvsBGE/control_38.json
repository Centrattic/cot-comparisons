Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author's girlfriend was acting suspiciously\u2014like hiding her phone, acting distracted, dressing up unusually, and then there's the condom box. The author found the condoms, got upset, and the girlfriend claimed she was being raped. The author doesn't believe her because of the inconsistencies (like the fancy clothes and condoms) and kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication. The author had reasons to be suspicious because of the behavior changes. But when confronted, the girlfriend gave an extreme explanation\u2014being raped\u2014which the author found hard to believe due to the other details.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not believing her. Well, trust is a big part of relationships. If someone accuses you of a serious crime without a plausible explanation, it's natural to be skeptical, especially if there are conflicting clues. However, when someone says they're being raped, that's a serious allegation. The author should consider the possibility that the girlfriend is in danger and maybe seek help through proper channels instead of just dismissing it.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't supposed to be the police. If there's no evidence of an actual rape beyond the girlfriend's claim and there are other suspicious behaviors, the author's doubt isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way the author reacted\u2014kicking her out without seeking to understand or involve authorities might be problematic. Also, the girlfriend's explanation about being abused but unable to leave is a red flag that should be taken seriously. \n\nBut the author is also justified in not accepting a story that has contradictions. The girlfriend's behavior doesn't align with being a victim in a non-consensual situation. The use of condoms and the deliberate dressing up could suggest consent. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be based on a mix of trust issues and trying to protect himself from betrayal.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation, but if there's no evidence, the author isn't necessarily wrong to be skeptical. However, the right approach would have been to not immediately dismiss the possibility of abuse but to seek help or talk to someone else. The author's immediate reaction was to break up, which might be harsh, but not entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut if the girlfriend is actually a victim, then the author's disbelief is harmful. However, without evidence, the author has a right to question the story. The problem is the balance between trust and being naive. In this case, the author's actions are a mix of self-protection and a breakdown in communication. The answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole because he acted on his doubts, but maybe it's a nuanced situation. However, given that the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious matter and the author didn't seek to verify it properly, he might be in the wrong for not taking it more seriously. Wait, but there's conflicting evidence. The author isn't in the wrong for not believing a story that has contradictions. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
