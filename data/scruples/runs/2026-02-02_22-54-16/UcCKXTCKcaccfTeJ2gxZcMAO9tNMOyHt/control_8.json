She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mother. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is off-and-on, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom, and later moved in with her rent-free. The mom broke confidentiality by telling others, then blamed the author when confronted. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in or not, considering her past help. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the mom committed fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name and not reporting properly, the author might have a duty to report it. However, the author might have a conflict of interest since they've lived with her and she's helped them. But the mom's actions\u2014using someone else's name, tax evasion, lack of insurance\u2014could be illegal, regardless of their relationship.\n\nMoral-wise, the author might feel conflicted because the mom helped them during a vulnerable time. But the mom's betrayal (telling others about the author's mental health and now using their identity) could justify the author's decision to report her. Also, the mom's lack of remorse and tendency to blame others might make the situation more complex.\n\nI should also think about the legal implications. If the author's name is on the business, they could be legally liable for any issues, even if they didn't know. So turning in the mom might protect the author from future legal problems. On the other hand, if the author doesn't report her, they might be complicit in the fraud.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for reporting? If the mom is committing crimes, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting them. The fact that the mom is their parent doesn't absolve her of legal responsibilities. The author isn't obligated to protect someone else's illegal activities, especially if they were misled or used.\n\nAlso, the author was a victim of the mom's betrayal before. So this might be a case of standing up for oneself, even against family. Legally, they might be doing the right thing by reporting. Morally, it's a tough spot, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing the law over family ties in this case.\n\nSo the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
