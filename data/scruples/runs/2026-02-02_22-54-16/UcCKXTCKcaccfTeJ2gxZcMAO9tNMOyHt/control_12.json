She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist, with a bipolar diagnosis. Their relationship is on-again, off-again. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it, trusting her enough to confide in her. The mom then broke that trust by telling everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom blamed the author and gave a shallow apology.\n\nNow, the mom has opened a business in the author's name and seems to be engaging in shady tax practices, using the business account for personal expenses, not declaring purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her but is conflicted because their mom has provided a place to stay rent-free.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in. The key points here are the ethical implications of reporting someone who has wronged you, especially when you've benefited from their help. Legally, if the mom is committing crimes, the author might have a duty to report them, especially since the business is under the author's name, which could put the author at legal risk. However, the mother used the author's identity without consent, which is a separate issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a tough spot. The mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation. The author might be protecting someone who has hurt them, but the mom's actions could be illegal. The author's decision to report could be seen as self-preservation or as a necessary action to prevent further harm. On the other hand, not reporting might mean enabling the mom's fraudulent behavior.\n\nLegally, if the author's name is tied to the business, they could be implicated in the illegal activities. So, there's a self-interest in reporting to avoid liability. Morally, it's complex because of the family relationship and past support. However, the mom's actions in using the author's identity without consent add another layer of wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting their mom. They have a right to protect themselves legally and ethically, especially given the mom's manipulative behavior. The mom's past actions and current legal violations justify the author's decision to report her, despite the gratitude for the past help. The author's mental health history and the mom's betrayal make it a situation where self-preservation is valid.\n"
