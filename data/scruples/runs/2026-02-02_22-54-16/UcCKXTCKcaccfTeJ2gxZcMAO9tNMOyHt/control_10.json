She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist with bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis and stayed with their mom after being hospitalized. They trusted her with that information, but she spread it, leading to a confrontation. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax issues and lack of insurance.\n\nSo, the author is conflicted between reporting her and their gratitude for the support during a tough time. But the mom's actions are unethical and possibly illegal. The key points are the mom's betrayal, the illegality of her business practices, and the author's moral duty to report illegal activities versus their personal history.\n\nThe author isn't directly involved in the illegal activities, but the business is in their name. That could put the author in legal trouble if it's discovered they knew and didn't act. Also, the mom's history suggests she might not take responsibility. The author's main dilemma is between loyalty to their mom and doing the right thing legally and ethically. Given that the mom has violated trust before and is engaging in potentially criminal behavior, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting her. The answer would be B (No) because the mom's actions are illegal, and the author has a right to protect themselves and report wrongdoing, especially when the mom has shown no genuine remorse.\n"
