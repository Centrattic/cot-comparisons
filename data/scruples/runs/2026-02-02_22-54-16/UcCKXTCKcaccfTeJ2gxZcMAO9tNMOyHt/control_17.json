She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The background is complicated. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author was struggling with depression, told their mom about their hospital stay, and then the mom told everyone, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with questionable practices.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission to open a business, that's identity theft. Even if the author is hesitant because of their history, the mom's actions are illegal. The author is considering reporting her, which is a legal right. They might feel conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay, but the author mentioned it's been a fickle relationship with periods of silence. The mom's refusal to apologize and her manipulative behavior (like blaming the author for the breach of trust) adds to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no. They have a right to report the identity theft. Emotionally, they might feel guilty because of the history, but the mom's actions are unethical. The author isn't the one breaking the law here; the mom is. The answer would likely be B (No), since the author is not in the wrong for exposing the mom's illegal actions. They're protecting their identity and the law, which is a valid reason.\n"
