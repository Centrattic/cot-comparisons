She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they'd be in the wrong for turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated relationship with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of lying and narcissistic behavior. The key points are:\n\n1. The mom has a history of betrayal, like spreading the author's private mental health information.\n2. The author is living with her rent-free, which they're grateful for, but there's a power imbalance here.\n3. The mom started a business in the author's name and possibly engaged in tax evasion or other shady practices.\n4. The author is considering exposing her but is conflicted due to her past help and the family relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the legal and ethical aspects. If the mom actually committed crimes (like tax evasion, using a business account for personal expenses, not having proper insurance), then the author has a responsibility to report it if they have evidence. But there's a personal angle here\u2014family ties and past support. However, the mom's actions are illegal regardless of their relationship. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting her if the claims are true. The mom's betrayal in the past might even justify it, as the author isn't obligated to protect someone who's harmed them. But the answer depends on whether the author has concrete evidence and if they're doing it for the right reasons (not revenge but to prevent harm). If the author is acting in self-preservation or to stop illegal activities, then they're not in the wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
