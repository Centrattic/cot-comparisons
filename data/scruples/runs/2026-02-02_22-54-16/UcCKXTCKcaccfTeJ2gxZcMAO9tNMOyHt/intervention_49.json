She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax issues and lacks proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom used the author's name without permission to open a business, that might be identity theft or fraud. Even if the mom is a difficult person, the law doesn't typically consider family relationships when determining right or wrong in such cases. The author might have a legal obligation to report this if it's illegal.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The mom helped the author by letting them live rent-free after their mental health crisis. The author is grateful but also hurt from past betrayals. However, the mom's actions in starting the business could be illegal, which could cause problems for the author if not addressed. There's a conflict between personal loyalty and legal responsibility.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude and the need to protect themselves from potential legal repercussions. If the mom is engaging in tax evasion or other illegal activities under the author's name, that could put the author's own records in jeopardy. By not reporting, the author might be complicit, especially if they knew or should have known about the illegal activities.\n\nAlso, the mom's lack of sincere apologies and tendency to shift blame might make the author feel justified in taking action. But morally, should the author be held to a higher standard because of their family relationship? In many cases, people are expected to report crimes regardless of the perpetrator's identity, as it's a matter of justice and accountability.\n\nHowever, the author might have emotional reasons to hesitate. Reporting a family member can be painful and lead to further estrangement. But the key question is whether turning in the mother is ethically wrong. If the mother's actions are illegal, then reporting might be the right thing to do, even if it's hard. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the law over personal feelings, especially if their own well-being is at risk.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral perspectives, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have a duty to report illegal activities, even if it's a family member, to prevent harm to themselves and others. The mother's past behavior might make the author less sympathetic to her, but the decision to report is about upholding the law, not just the relationship.\n"
