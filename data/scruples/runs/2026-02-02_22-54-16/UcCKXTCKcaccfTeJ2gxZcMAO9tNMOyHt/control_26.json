She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with long periods of not speaking. The person had a mental health crisis, got hospitalized, and told their mom about it. They moved back in and the mom spread the information, which caused tension. Now the mom opened a business in their name with shady practices\u2014tax issues, using business account for personal stuff, not claiming purchases, lack of insurance. The person is torn between reporting her and the fact that the mom provided shelter and support during their recovery.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions versus the daughter's potential actions. Legally, using someone's identity for a business without their consent is fraud. The mom's actions are definitely illegal. The daughter is considering reporting her despite the mom's help. The question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the daughter might feel guilty because the mom helped them during a vulnerable time. But on the other hand, the mom committed a crime by using her identity. The daughter's responsibility to report illegal activities might outweigh the gratitude. However, the daughter also has a complicated relationship and possible emotional trauma from the mom's past behavior.\n\nBut legally, the daughter isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The mom's help in the past doesn't absolve her of current illegal actions. The daughter is in a difficult position, but the right thing to do would be to report the fraud. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
