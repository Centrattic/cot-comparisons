She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The scenario involves the mom having a bad personality, being a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder, and the author living with her rent-free. The key points are that the mom told others about the author's mental health, didn't apologize sincerely, and now opened a business in the author's name with possible tax issues.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission and committed tax fraud, that's a crime. The author's right to legal recourse should be considered. Legally, allowing someone to use your identity for a business without your consent can be identity theft. Even if the author was in a vulnerable state when they admitted themselves to the psychiatric ward, the mom's actions of using the author's name could be illegal regardless of their personal relationship.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is grateful for the housing but feels betrayed. The mom's past behavior (lying, lack of sincere apologies) suggests she might not take responsibility. The author is trying to balance gratitude with the need to act on potential illegal activities. But if the mom is engaging in fraudulent behavior, the author has a right to protect their identity and report it. The mom's personal issues with mental health and personality disorders don't excuse the illegal actions. So ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, especially if they can prove the mom acted without consent.\n\nAlso, the author's mental health history is relevant. They were in a psychiatric ward, which might have made them more vulnerable. The mom's actions could be part of a pattern of manipulation or exploitation, especially given her narcissistic tendencies. The author isn't to blame for the mom's decisions to act inappropriately. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong to turn in their mom. Legally, if the mom committed a crime, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting it. The mom's past behavior (breaching trust, not apologizing) supports the author's decision. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to confirm if that's the case.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might be seen as ungrateful, but that's about ethics, not legal right. The mother's mental health diagnosis could be used to defend her actions, but that's not a valid legal defense for fraud. Also, the author might be protecting themselves from future legal liability if the mom's business is illegal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
