She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The daughter told her about her psychiatric hospitalization, and the mom betrayed her trust by spreading the information. The daughter confronted her, but the mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in her name and seems to be doing shady things tax-wise and lacking proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom used the daughter's name without permission to open a business, that's identity theft or fraud, which is illegal. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the daughter if the business has debts or legal issues. Also, the tax evasion and lack of insurance are serious offenses. The daughter has a right to protect her identity and prevent being implicated in illegal activities.\n\nEthically, the mom's betrayal and lack of accountability might make the daughter feel justified in taking action. The daughter has been living with her mom rent-free, but that doesn't obligate her to cover up the mom's crimes. The mom's past behavior, including lying and not apologizing, suggests a pattern of self-centeredness that doesn't consider her daughter's well-being.\n\nHowever, there's a conflict between familial obligations and legal/ethical duties. The daughter might feel torn because her mom has helped her during a difficult time. But the mom's actions here are potentially harmful and illegal. Reporting the mom could prevent future harm and legal issues for the daughter. \n\nI think the daughter isn't in the wrong because she's protecting herself from legal repercussions and preventing her mom's actions from affecting her negatively. The mom's misuse of her identity and illegal business practices cross a line, regardless of their past relationship. The daughter's decision to report her is more about self-preservation and upholding the law rather than personal vendetta, especially since the mom has shown no genuine remorse before.\n"
