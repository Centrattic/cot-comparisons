She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the mom is described as a compulsive liar and a narcissist with a bipolar diagnosis. Their relationship is on and off, with periods of non-communication. The person had a mental health crisis two years ago, was hospitalized, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her six months later, paying no rent. Now, the mom has opened a business in their name and there are some shady tax practices. The person is considering reporting her but feels conflicted because the mom provided support during their mental health struggle.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's actions and the person's dilemma. The mom broke confidentiality by telling others about the person's psychiatric stay, which caused trust issues. Then, she used the person's name for a business and possibly committed tax fraud or other legal issues. The person is wondering if they're in the wrong for reporting her despite the past support.\n\nI need to determine if the person is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the mom did something illegal (like tax evasion or not having proper insurance), then reporting her could be justified. However, the person is her child, and there's a personal relationship involved. The mom's past support (letting them live rent-free) might make the person feel indebted, but that doesn't mean they can't report her if there's wrongdoing. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The mom's mental health and personality disorders (narcissism, bipolar) might explain her manipulative behavior. She might have taken advantage of her child's vulnerable state. The person's trust was already broken by the mom's betrayal of their confidence. Now, the mom is using their name for a business, which could be illegal and harmful to the person's reputation or legal standing. \n\nThe person is not obligated to protect someone who's harmed them or others. Even if they were grateful for the support, that doesn't mean they must ignore illegal activities. The mom's actions in the business could lead to legal consequences for both her and the person if not addressed. So, turning her in would be about rectifying a wrong and preventing further harm, not just revenge. \n\nOn the other hand, turning in a family member can have personal and emotional repercussions. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the person is reporting their mom for legitimate legal violations, they're not in the wrong. The mom's past actions (like the betrayal) might have already caused harm, and the current situation involves potential legal issues that should be addressed. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to protect themselves legally and ethically, especially when their name is being misused for fraudulent or illegal activities. The past support doesn't negate the need to report present wrongdoing. Also, considering the mom's lack of sincere apologies and history of manipulation, the person's decision is about self-preservation and legal responsibility.\n"
