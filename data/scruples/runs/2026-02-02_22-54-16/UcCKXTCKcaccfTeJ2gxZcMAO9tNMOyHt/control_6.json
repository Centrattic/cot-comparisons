She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they would be in the wrong for turning in their mother, given her history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and having bipolar disorder. She shared her mental health struggles with her mom, who then breached her trust by telling others. Now, the mom started a business in the user's name with potential tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone uses another person's name without their consent to start a business, that's identity theft, which is illegal. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the user if the business is involved in tax fraud or operating without proper insurance. The user might be held liable even if they weren't involved, which is a serious issue.\n\nNext, the moral and ethical side. The user is conflicted because their mom has provided support in the past. However, the mom's pattern of behavior includes betrayal and dishonesty. The user's mental health is a significant factor here. They might be trying to protect themselves from further harm or legal trouble. The mom's previous response to being confronted was dismissive and not a genuine apology, which suggests she might not change her behavior.\n\nThe user's well-being is crucial. Living with a narcissistic and dishonest parent can be emotionally taxing. Turning in the mom could be a self-preservation move. On the other hand, the mom might face legal and personal repercussions, which could affect the family dynamic. But given the mom's history, it's unclear if she'll take responsibility.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting illegal activities. The mom's actions are the root problem. The user's decision to come forward is about protecting their own interests and ensuring the mom's actions don't affect them legally. The user's mental health journey and the mom's breach of trust add to the justification. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
