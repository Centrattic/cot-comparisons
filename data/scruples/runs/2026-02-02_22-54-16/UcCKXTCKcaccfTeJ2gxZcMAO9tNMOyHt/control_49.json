She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom for certain actions. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is tumultuous, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. They moved back in with her and she kept it a secret, but then told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom was defensive and insincere in her apology. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name, possibly with tax and insurance issues.\n\nThe question is whether turning her in is wrong. The user is seeking a moral judgment here, not just a legal one, but maybe also considering the context of their relationship and the mom's past behavior.\n\nMoral considerations: The mom's actions are questionable\u2014starting a business under someone else's name without their consent, possible tax evasion, not having proper insurance. Those are illegal activities. The author is in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom for housing after a mental health episode. The mom's betrayal by revealing the author's secret adds to the tension. The author might feel that the mom has already crossed lines, and this latest action is another betrayal. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of gratitude. The mom provided a place to stay, which the author is grateful for. However, the mom's behavior has been harmful and deceitful. The author might feel that the mom's actions are not just harmful to them but also illegal, which could affect others if the business is shady. \n\nLegally, using someone's name without permission to start a business is likely fraudulent. The tax issues and lack of insurance could be illegal as well. So, from a legal standpoint, turning her in might be justified. However, the emotional and personal aspects complicate things. The author is caught between a sense of duty to report illegal activities and a conflicted relationship with their mom.\n\nThe mom's past behavior (lying, narcissism, not taking responsibility) suggests a pattern of manipulative behavior. The author might feel that the mom's actions are part of a larger pattern of exploitation. If the business is indeed illegal, then the author might have a moral obligation to report it, especially if it could harm others or if they are being used without consent.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a position where they might feel indebted due to the previous support. But if that support was given under false pretenses (since the mom lied about keeping the secret), then the debt might not be as clear. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report their mom, especially if there are legal implications and the mom has a history of harmful behavior. The author has been a victim of the mom's actions, and the business in their name is another instance. The author's concern for their own well-being and the potential legal issues would support the decision to report. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
