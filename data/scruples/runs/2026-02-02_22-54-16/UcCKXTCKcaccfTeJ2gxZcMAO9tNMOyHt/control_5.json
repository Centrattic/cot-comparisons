She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the situation. The mom is described as a narcissist with bipolar disorder, and the author has a strained relationship with her. The author admitted to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and later moved back in. Then the mom spread the information about the admission, which the author found untrustworthy. The mom also gave a non-sincere apology. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name and seems to be doing shady things like tax evasion and not having proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The mom's actions are clearly problematic. Lying, using someone else's name without consent, and engaging in illegal activities are serious. The author's dilemma is whether they have the right to take legal action against their mother despite her past support. \n\nThe key points here are consent and legality. Using someone's name to open a business without their permission is illegal, regardless of the relationship. The author might be a victim of identity fraud. Even if the mom did help the author in the past, that doesn't justify illegal activities. The author's duty to report such actions isn't necessarily negated by past kindness. \n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. The author feels grateful for the support they received. But the mom's betrayal in spreading the author's private information and her lack of genuine remorse might tip the scales. The author's mental health is a factor here too, given their history of depression. \n\nLegally, if the mom used the author's name without permission, that's a violation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop that. The mom's past actions (like lying) don't make her a victim here. So, from a legal standpoint, the author is justified in reporting her. Ethically, it's about right and wrong actions. The mom's behavior is unethical, and the author is trying to protect their identity and ensure legal compliance. \n\nThe author's gratitude might conflict with their sense of justice, but they aren't obligated to stay silent about illegal activities. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
