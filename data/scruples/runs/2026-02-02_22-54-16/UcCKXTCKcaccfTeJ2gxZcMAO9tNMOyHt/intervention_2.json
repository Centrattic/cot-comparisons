She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is complex. The mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health episode, told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't sincerely apologize. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of proper insurance.\n\nSo, the author is considering reporting their mom. The question is whether they are in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the mom is indeed committing crimes, the author isn't obligated to stay silent. Even though the mom helped them live rent-free, that doesn't mean the author should ignore illegal activities. The mom's actions here could be fraudulent or involve tax evasion, which are serious offenses. The author might have a legal duty to report if they know about these activities, especially if they were used without consent. \n\nEmotionally, the author is torn because of the past support. But legally, they aren't in the wrong. The mom's past behavior (lying, betraying trust) might make the author more justified in reporting her. The key points are the illegality of the business practices and the use of the author's name without permission. The author's mental health history and the strained relationship add context but don't change the legal obligation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
