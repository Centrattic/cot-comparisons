She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on-again, off-again. The user had a mental health episode, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told the mom. They moved back in with her and she let them live rent-free. But the mom then told everyone, which the user found out and confronted her about. The mom blamed the user and gave a non-sincere apology.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the user's name, and the user thinks the business is shady with tax issues and no proper insurance. The user is torn between turning her in and not, considering she helped them in their time of need.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the mom did help the user when they were struggling. However, she committed fraud by starting a business in their name without permission. That's a criminal act. The user might have a right to report it to protect their identity and legal standing. But there's also the emotional aspect\u2014family ties and past support. \n\nBut the core issue here is the mom's illegal activity. Even if the user had issues with the mom in the past, the business is a recent act that's against the law. The user might not be in the wrong for reporting this, as it's about legal and ethical considerations. The mom's previous actions don't absolve her of current crimes. Also, the user's trust was already broken, so the mom's betrayal isn't a valid reason to not report. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to report their mother's unauthorized and potentially illegal business activities.\n"
