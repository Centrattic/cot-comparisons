She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation involves the mom being a narcissist, liar, and having bipolar disorder. The author has a complicated relationship with their mom, has a history of mental health issues, and lived with her after a psychiatric stay. The mom broke confidentiality by telling others about the author's hospitalization and then started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical and legal aspects. The mom's actions of opening a business in someone else's name without consent is likely fraudulent and illegal. The author is considering reporting her for legal reasons. On the other hand, the mom has provided a place to stay, which the author is grateful for, but that doesn't excuse the mom's misconduct.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is about reporting illegal activities. Even if there's a personal relationship, the law requires individuals to report criminal behavior. The mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) makes it clear that she may not have had the author's consent, so the author isn't at fault for the mom's actions. The author is protecting their own interests and preventing potential legal fallout by reporting, which is a responsible action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
