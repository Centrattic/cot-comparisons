She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The background is complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. There's a history of not speaking for long periods. The author had a mental health episode, told the mom about it, who then told everyone, leading to a breakdown in trust. Now the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and insurance issues.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: they were vulnerable, had a mental health crisis, and trusted their mom to some extent, even if not deeply. The mom violated that trust by spreading the information and now is using the author's name in a business that might be illegal. The author is considering reporting her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name without consent, then the author isn't at fault for reporting that. The mom's actions could be illegal, and the author isn't responsible for her actions. The author isn't exploiting the situation; they're protecting their identity and potentially preventing legal issues. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between family loyalty and doing what's right. However, the author has already been betrayed by the mom multiple times, so the mom's actions might have broken that loyalty. The author isn't the one acting unethically here; the mom is the one committing the fraud. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being grateful for the mom's help, but that doesn't obligate them to cover up illegal activities. The mom's past actions (betrayal of trust, not taking responsibility) might weigh against forgiveness. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They are acting in self-preservation and possibly preventing further harm from the mom's actions. Answer B.\n"
