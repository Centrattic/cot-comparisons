She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The person admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward two years ago and told their mom, who then shared this information with others. When confronted, the mom didn't offer a sincere apology and instead blamed the person. Now, the mom has opened a business in the person's name and is possibly doing shady things with taxes and insurance. The person is considering turning her in but is torn because their mom provided shelter during their struggles.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mom's actions versus the person's potential actions. The mom violated trust by sharing personal information and now is using the person's name in a business with possible illegal activities. The person is dealing with depression and has a history of needing support, which the mom provided, but under manipulative or harmful circumstances.\n\nThe question is about whether the person is in the wrong for turning in their mom. On one hand, the mom's actions could be illegal, so reporting her might be ethically right to prevent harm. On the other hand, the person might feel guilt because their mom helped them during a tough time, even if it was for her own reasons or manipulated in some way.\n\nBut wait, the mom's help was rent-free living, which the person is grateful for, but the underlying issue is that the mom is using their name for a business with possible tax evasion and other legal issues. If the mom is operating a business under false pretenses or committing fraud, that's a legal matter. The person might be a victim of identity theft or fraud, which is a crime. By turning her in, they could be protecting themselves and others from potential harm if the business is indeed illegal.\n\nAlso, the mom's lack of sincere apologies and history of narcissistic behavior suggests she might not take responsibility, making the person's decision to report her a form of self-protection. However, there's the emotional aspect of their relationship and the person's possible guilt over not reciprocating the support in the same way.\n\nBut legally and ethically, if someone is using another's identity for illegal activities, the affected person has a right to report it. The mom's past actions (like breaching confidentiality) don't absolve her of current legal wrongdoings. The person's gratitude for the help in the past might conflict with their moral obligation to report illegal activities now. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong for wanting to turn her in. They might feel conflicted, but the ethical stance here would be that they are protecting themselves and upholding the law against their mom's actions. The mom's previous support doesn't negate the present harm or legal issues. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
