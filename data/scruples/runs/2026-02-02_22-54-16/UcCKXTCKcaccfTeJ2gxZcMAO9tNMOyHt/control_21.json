She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated relationship. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and moved in with her after a psychiatric stay. They asked her not to tell anyone, but she did. Then, she started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom is using the author's name for a business and engaging in shady practices like tax evasion or not having proper insurance, that's illegal. The author might have a legal right to report this to protect themselves from liability. If the business is in their name without their consent, that's identity theft. The mom's actions could expose the author to legal risks, so reporting might be necessary for self-protection.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is grateful for the support during their mental health struggles. However, the mom has a history of betrayal and lacks genuine remorse. Turning her in could be seen as self-preservation rather than betrayal. The author might feel conflicted due to the history, but the decision is about legal rights and safety.\n\nAlso, the mom's past behavior\u2014lying, not apologizing\u2014suggests she doesn't respect boundaries or legal matters. The author might be trying to prevent future harm. The key here is whether the author's action (reporting) is justified given the mom's misuse of their identity and illegal activities. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves. Morally, it's complex, but the author's actions are about rectifying a wrong done to them.\n"
